In both marshes, the denitrification rates varied significantly with the season only in loam soil. The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.HighlightsDenitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.","10.1111/ejss.12956","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329213","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083381567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12956&partnerID=40&md5=1111fdd770769b6d9af5ca6ed5172cd6"

We examined sediment organic carbon stock in the four dominant salt marsh species areas viz. Suaeda maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Salicornia brachiata from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India in two seasons i.e. dry (July 2015) and wet season (January 2016). We examined above ground (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB), sediment physico-chemical properties like pH, BD, composition, OM%, C-org%, C and N%, sediment organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and multivariate analysis on studied variables. Maximum AGB was recorded in A. indicum in both dry and wet season (10.91 +/- 0.15g/cm(2) and 14.87 +/- 0.68g/cm(2)). The highest BGB was observed in S. maritima in both seasons, as 2.01 +/- 0.35g/cm(2) and 4.49 +/- 0.35g/cm(2), respectively. The OM percentage ranged between 4.13 +/-.083 and 7.23 +/-.088% and the highest was observed in the wet season from S. maritima. Sediment organic stocks (Mgha (-1)) ranged from 8.42 +/-.640 to 54.46 +/- 1.46Mgha (-1) reflects nearly 7 times higher than the dry season. The present study can be useful for the estimation of blue carbon budgets in tropical coastal ecosystem since this type was the first hand information from this area.","10.1007/s13157-018-1094-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329214","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055882748&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-018-1094-6&partnerID=40&md5=59843ca56fa3fe7e11d9b39de1c087c6"

Particularly, fluctuations in abundance of dominant species might indicate major changes in resource use and ecosystem functioning. Here we use quantitative surveys of Baltic brackish and salt marsh plant communities to infer how variability in species abundances and environmental conditions influence plant assimilation rates and whether compensatory effects in abundance mask variability in functionality. The variability in species richness and assimilation rates was negatively correlated with average soil organic matter content and moisture and positively correlated with soil pH. It was independent of the variability in soil conditions. The abundances of rare species and species of intermediate abundances increased with increasing community wide assimilation rates. Our findings indicate that the strength of compensatory mechanisms that stabilise assimilation rates in salt marsh environments heavily depend on soil conditions. In the present study sites benign soil conditions stabilized assimilation rates while more stressful conditions caused synchronous fluctuations in total abundance and assimilation.","10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106480","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329216","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074894536&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2019.106480&partnerID=40&md5=57d7ea1db8f3a9da8b7fa0bb55f9c58d"

Native (Suaeda salsa) and invasive (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes were selected to study the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and stocks in the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that the SOC contents (g/kg) and stocks (kg/m(2)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years, especially for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The SOC contents exhibited an even distribution along the soil profiles in native salt marshes, while the SOC contents were gradually decreased with depth after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years. The natural ln response ratios (LnRR) were applied to identify the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on the SOC stocks. We also found that Spartina alterniflora invasion might cause soil organic carbon losses in a short-term phase (2-4 years in this study) due to the negative LnRR values, especially for 20-60 cm depth. And the SOCD in surface layer (0-20 cm) do not increase linearly with the invasive age. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that silt + clay content was exponentially related with SOC in surface layer (Adjusted R-2 = 0.43, P < 0.001), suggesting that soil texture could play a key role in SOC sequestration of coastal salt marshes.","10.1007/s11769-018-0955-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329221","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043370383&doi=10.1007%2fs11769-018-0955-5&partnerID=40&md5=04c8be8778adb8bae6cc6a94646c8782"

Pit fall traps were installed with 5 replicates in an elevational gradient at 20 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm, and 130 cm above MHT (mean high tide: 157 cm + NN, NN: 500 cm above 0 at Amsterdam gauge). The rove beetle fauna exhibits two assemblages, which exactly correspond with the vegetational communities. The elevation above MHT was the major environmental parameter, which highly correlated with the flood frequency. The other environmental parameters, e.g.. electric conductivity, sand content, content of organic matter, mean yearly water content, and pH of soil, had no significant influence on the occurrence of species. The lower salt marsh (Puccinellietum) is significantly preferred by only four species, while in the upper salt marsh (Juncetum gerardii) 17 species occurred with significant higher abundance. The mean occurrence referring elevation and flood frequency was calculated for 34 species. Even the species preferring the lower salt marsh seem to have their highest abundance not at the lowest level at 20 cm above MHT, but at 40 cm or 60 cm above MHT.

The 0-20 cm soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) and soil total nitrogen pool (STNP) ranged from 4.38 to 15.92 Mg/ha and from 0.24 to 2.37 Mg/ha, respectively, during the observed period. The results show there was a low level of spatial variation in both SOC and STN, which is to some extent the result of the same farmland management practiced in this region. The seasonal variation of SOC was attributed to plant growth and crop residue returning back to soil, while the spatial variation was mainly resulted from the fertilization practice. The average 0-20 cm SOCP and STNP were 10.38 +/- A 2.50 and 1.27 +/- A 0.38 Mg/ha, respectively, in the study region, both of which were much lower than in other ecosystems. Further analysis indicated that SOC was positively correlated with STN.

The pH, organic matter content, NO3- and NO2- concentrations were determined on samples from marshes with and without grasses. Denitrification was measured in laboratory studies over a temperature range of 4-60.degree. C and a pH range of 5.0-9.0 by monitoring NO3- reduction, NO2- reduction and N2 evolution. Optimum conditions were controlled by a temperature-pH interaction which caused shifts in the pH optima relative to the change in temperature. NO3- and NO2- were reduced over a broad range of NO3- concentrations; 0.2 mg NO2--N ml-1 completely inhibited denitrification. The presence of NO3- reverses this inhibition. N2O was produced only at low pH values and low NO3- concentrations.

The mean soil respiration (SR) of the salt water-fresh water mixing zone (MZ) was 2.89 times higher than that of the coastal zone (CZ) (4.73 and 1.63molm(-2)s(-1), respectively, p<.05), and soil dehydrogenase activity was the main microbial factor influencing SR. In addition to the higher soil microbial biomass, the MZ had more -Proteobacteria than the CZ, as well as some specific bacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity such as Pseudomonas sp. and Limnobacter sp. that might have led to its higher dehydrogenase activity and respiratory rates. Additionally, the CZ possessed more Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with the ability to fix CO2 than the MZ. Significantly lower soil salinity in MZ (4.25gkg(-1)) was suitable for -Proteobacteria, but detrimental for Halobacteria compared with CZ (7.09gkg(-1), p<.01), which might lead to the lower microbial decomposition capacity of soils in CZ.

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

It's remains limited to understand how Q(10) of anaerobic soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is regulated by soil property in various wetlands with distinct hydrological characteristics. In the present study, samples of soil at the depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm were collected in three typical Phragmites australis marshes, including a freshwater marsh (FPa), a no-tidal salt marsh (NTPa) and a tidal salt marsh (TPa), in the Yellow River estuary. The soil samples were incubated at 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively, to determine the rates of anaerobic CO2 production, Q(10) values, and their relations to soil properties. Over 70-d incubation, temperature rise significantly increased the mean rates by 70%-136% (from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C) and 64%-142% (from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) among the marshes, with the mean Q(10) values ranging from 1.61 to 2.66. The rates of CO2 production and Q(10) values were significantly affected by wetland type and soil depth. Among marshes, the Q(10) of the FPa and NTPa soils was higher than that of the TPa soil (for 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm but for 20-30 cm); along soil depths, the Q(10) of the top soil was higher than that of the subsoil (for FPa and NTPa but for TPa). Q(10) was affected by total organic carbon (TOC), salinity and pH, and the effects were different with marshes. TOC was a main factor regulating Q(10) for the freshwater and the no-tidal salt marshes, while salinity and pH were main factors for the tidal salt marsh. The findings highlight an interactive mechanism of soil property and tidal underlying the response of SOM decomposition to temperature change in estuarine wetlands.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107409","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329242","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099808868&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107409&partnerID=40&md5=0a03a96279bcd2a5523a486449690dba"

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone is an area where range limits and ecotone dynamics can be studied in tandem as recent decreases in winter temperature extremes have allowed for mangrove expansion at the expense of salt marsh. In this study, we assessed aboveground and belowground plant-soil dynamics across the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone quantifying micro-spatial patterns in horizontal extent. Specifically, we studied vegetation and rooting dynamics of large and small trees, the impact of salt marshes (e.g. species and structure) on mangroves, and the influence of vegetation on soil properties along transects from underneath the mangrove canopy into the surrounding salt marsh. Vegetation and rooting dynamics differed in horizontal reach, and there was a positive relationship between mangrove tree height and rooting extent. We found that the horizontal expansion of mangrove roots into salt marsh extended up to eight meters beyond the aboveground boundary. Variation in vegetation structure and local hydrology appear to control mangrove seedling dynamics. Finally, soil carbon density and organic matter did not differ within locations across the salt marsh-mangrove interface. By studying aboveground and belowground variation across the ecotone, we can better predict the ecological effects of continued range expansion in response to climate change.","10.1007/s00442-018-4098-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329246","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045075797&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-018-4098-2&partnerID=40&md5=220727a6d160dcf9398b99b88dd085e1"

In this study, we hypothesized that imbalances in the nitrogen-phosphorus (N-P) input would result in the nonlinear response of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, fractions and mineralization to the N-P input ratio. We applied three N-P input ratios (low (5:1), medium (15:1), high (45:1)) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) for four years (in which N added increased from 8.67 to 26.01 g N m(-2) y(-1) and P added decreased from 1.73 to 0.58 g P m(-2) y(-1)) and quantified their impacts on SOC fractions and SOC mineralisation. The control treatment did not receive fertilization. The results showed that the N and P input led to overall increases in the availability of soil nutrients (i.e., inorganic N (IN) and available P (AP)), stimulation of plant biomass and changes of microbial community structure (i.e., gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). N and P input increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and decreased aromatic DOC components through improving N availability and stimulating plant growth. Notably, though, there may be a threshold N-P input ratio between 15:1 and 45:1 that, once crossed, triggers the loss of SOC. Appropriate increase in N availability induced by low and medium N-P input ratios would stimulate the SOC mineralization. However, excessive N-P input ratio would reduce SOC mineralization. Path analysis indicated that N-P input ratios dominantly regulate SOC mineralisation by changing soil DOC and microbial biomass (MBC)contents and microbial community structure. Thus, we speculate that the continuous increase in N input causes a growing N-P imbalance that reduces SOC stocks, despite a reduction in SOC mineralisation.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105720","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329250","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114731303&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105720&partnerID=40&md5=ea32f0c047d23b181e98817ae8e4701b"

In marsh soils, the nitrates content was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in their upper horizons, and accumulation of N<sub>оrg</sub> on the surface is common in them, although in the subsoils it may also happen, if there are former humus-accumulative horizons buried by recent marine sediments. Accumulation of N<sub>оrg</sub> and N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ above the permafrost was recorded in the peat gleyzem, and within permafrost it occurred in the peat oligotrophic soil. The content of hydrolysable amino acids in soils is 0.6-8 g/kg, which corresponds to 30-60% of soil organic nitrogen and 2-12% of organic carbon. Profile patterns of amino acids N and organic N are similar. The amino acids composition was assessed as homogeneous, and the ratios of most of them as close. The shares of arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleuсine are below 4%, while they vary in the range 5-7% for lysine, valine, proline, serine and treonine, for alanine and leuсine - 10-12%. Down the profile of marsh soils, the share of glycine increases against variations 12 to 20% along with decreasing contributions of asparagines and glutamine amino acids from 11 to 6%. Correlation of N<sub>оrg</sub>, N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ and nitrogen of most amino acids with clay content and non-silicate iron compounds was revealed (r = 0.6-0.9). The highest r values were noted for the pairs: dithionite-soluble Fe and nitrogen of treonine and histidine.","10.31857/S0032180X20070138","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329255",NA

These coastal wetlands store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC), commonly known as ""blue carbon"" and excellent places to study C cycling. The Guadiana river estuary is among the most important tidal salt marshes in the South - Iberian coastal margin. Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary OM composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content (TOC) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23% and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) also showed a wide range between -22.4 and -27.0 parts per thousand. A(13)C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic C-13 enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments. Series of nalkanes were found in the range from C-10 to C-31. Carbon preference index ratio (CPI) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C-24-C-31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse OM inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant OM derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments. A well-resolved series of long-chain linear alkyl benzenes (LABs from C-4 to C-22) were recorded in all core sediment samples indicating direct discharge of untreated domestic and/or industrial effluents to the estuary. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more than 3 rings reflects the pyrogenic origin of a portion of the sedimentary OM. This study highlights the importance of different OM sources to the lower Guadiana estuarine sediments and contributes to a better knowledge about its origin, dynamics and fate.","10.1016/j.csr.2020.104076","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329264","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079641361&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2020.104076&partnerID=40&md5=07cb3b10292d1474f45d93bc64dc0f6c"

Several of these have explored the use of functional trajectories to track the increase in restored marsh function over time; however, these studies have disagreed as to the usefulness of such models in long-term predictions of restored marsh development. We compared indicators of four marsh functions (primary production, soil organic matter accumulation, sediment trapping, and maintenance of plant communities) in 6 restored and 11 reference (matched to restored marshes using principal components analysis) salt marshes in the Great Bay Estuary. The restored marshes were all constructed and planted on imported substrate and ranged in age from 1 to 14 years. We used marsh age in a space-for-time substitution to track constructed salt marsh development and explore the use of trajectories. A high degree of variability was observed among natural salt marsh sites, displaying the importance of carefully chosen reference sites. As expected, mean values for constructed site (n = 6) and reference site (n = 11) functions were significantly different. Using constructed marsh age as the independent variable and functional indicator values as dependent variables, nonlinear regression analyses produced several ecologically meaningful trajectories (r (2) > 0.9), demonstrating that the use of different-aged marshes can be a viable approach to developing functional trajectories. The trajectories illustrated that although indicators of some functions (primary production, sediment deposition, and plant species richness) may reach natural site values relatively quickly (<10 years), others (soil organic matter content) will take longer.","10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.01037.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329266","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036715388&doi=10.1046%2fj.1526-100X.2002.01037.x&partnerID=40&md5=15c112729cb406bf946b7f0e380f1294"

The results showed that the horizontal distributions of Fe and Mn contents showed an increasing tendency from Sparganiaceae-Potentilla supina marsh to bare flat. The vertical distribution characteristics of Fe and Mn contents in different marsh soils fluctuated significantly with the vegetation succession. The soil parent materials determined the Fe, Mn contents in the new-born marshes, and seawater, vegetations and soil fine particle also had important influences on their contents.

'Blue carbon' refers to carbon stored within resident vegetation (e.g. mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) and soil of coastal wetlands. This study aimed to quantify the impact of vegetation type on soil carbon stocks (organic and inorganic) and nitrogen in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of mangroves and tidal marsh habitats within nine temperate coastal blue carbon wetlands in South Australia. Results showed differences in surface soil organic carbon stocks (18.4 Mg OC ha(-1) for mangroves; 17.6 Mg OC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), inorganic carbon (31.9 Mg IC ha(-1) for mangroves; 35.1 Mg IC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), and total nitrogen (1.8 Mg TN ha(-1) for both) were not consistently driven by vegetation type. However, mangrove soils at two sites (Clinton and Port Augusta) and tidal marsh soils at one site (Torrens Island) had larger soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. These results highlighted site-specific differences in blue carbon stocks between the vegetation types and spatial variability within sites. Further, differences in spatial distribution of SOC within sites corresponded with variations in soil bulk density (BD). Results highlighted a link between SOC and BD in blue carbon soils. Understanding the drivers of carbon and nitrogen storage across different blue carbon environments and capturing its spatial variability will help improve predictions of the contribution these ecosystems to climate change mitigation.","10.1071/SR20040","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329278","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108881441&doi=10.1071%2fSR20040&partnerID=40&md5=75bbfc6a68e769b397f5063bdcfe4b85"

We investigated the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors in the Yangtze estuary at three spatial scales. Plant communities and edaphic factors were quantified at high and low tidal levels in both freshwater and salt marshes. Canonical correspondence analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors at the landscape scale (freshwater vs. salt marsh), the zonation scale (high vs. low tidal level) and the patch scale (dominant vs. other species). Soil salinity, moisture content, pH, bulk density, and organic carbon could well explain segregations of plants at the landscape and zonation scales. However, the same factors exhibited only very weak relationships to plant communities at the patch scale. These results suggest that plant communities in the Yangtze estuary are segregated at different spatial scales by different environmental factors. As spatial scale is often not explicitly addressed investigating community assembly rules, our study underscores the importance of scaling for an improved understanding of community organization in coastal wetlands.","10.1007/s10750-012-1191-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329280","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865434442&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-012-1191-0&partnerID=40&md5=aa6a42a95137eda722ba0765f05aff12"

Decapod crustaceans dominated the nekton on the marsh surface during both the spring and the fall. Densities of daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, the most abundant decapod, were not significantly different among marshes, but the size of these shrimp in created marshes was significantly smaller than in natural marshes. Densities of the marsh grass shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris and of 3 commercially-important crustaceans (white shrimp Penaeus setiferus, brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus, and blue crab Callinectes sapidus) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus were the most abundant fish collected, mainly on nonvegetated bottom adjacent to marsh habitats. Fish densities within vegetation (predominantly gobies and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Natural and created marshes, however, did not differ in species richness of nekton. Sediment macro-organic matter and density and species richness of macroinfauna (mainly polychaete worms) were all significantly lower in created marshes than natural marshes. There was a positive relationship in created marshes between marsh age and sediment macro-organic matter, but marsh age was not related to nekton densities. Natural marshes were similar in having low elevations and flooding durations between 74 and 80% of the year; while created marshes were flooded from 43 to 91% of the time. In contrast to marsh age, tidal flooding was often related to nekton densities in marsh habitats. We conclude that marsh elevation and tidal flooding are key characteristics affecting use by nekton and should be considered in marsh construction projects.","10.3354/meps151165","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329282","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030618559&doi=10.3354%2fmeps151165&partnerID=40&md5=0af6bb677379211dfb6201fcb310b408"

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.","10.3389/fmars.2020.00380","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329287","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087041053&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2020.00380&partnerID=40&md5=c822f25c2cc321f74241068202974a92"

The results provided by the analyses of rhizospheric soil (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, total nitrogen, etc.) and metal(loid)s' phytoavailability (assessed by EDTA) were discussed and related to plant metal uptake. The averages of pH and EC values of the bulk soil and rhizospheric samples were in the range of neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7-8) to saline (> 2 dS m(-1)), respectively. Heavy metal and As concentrations (e.g. similar to 600 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, similar to 11,000 mg kg(-1) Pb) were higher in the rhizosphere for both total and EDTA-extractable fraction.

Vegetation distribution in the studied salt marsh looked to be more affected by salinity than by metal pollution. The free availability of water for plants and the incoming nutrient-enriched effluents which flow through the salt marsh may have hindered the metal(loid)s' phytotoxicity.

Sediments were carefully collected every 1 cm from the trench wall. The samples were analyzed for PCBs, HCHs, Cs-137, organic carbon and grain size. The Cs-137 fallout and the sedimentary signature left by the 1960 Chilean tsunami were used as temporal markers to estimate the stratigraphic chronology and the sedimentation rates. PCBs were quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD), and positive samples were confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Based On these results, PCBs and HCHs deposition over the last 40 years was estimated. No PCBs were detected below the tsunami signature. Total concentrations ranged front undetectable (ND) to 32 ng/g d.w. for PCBs and from undetectable (ND) to 1.29 ng/g d.w. for HCHs. The highest PCB concentrations were found in the Upper 7 cut of the core. Even though PCBs were banned in 1982 as electrical fluids in Chile, total estimated PCB fluxes have increased approximately 20 times during the last 40 years: from undetectable values to 102.6 ng/cm(2)/year, reflecting that PCBs are still in use and being released into the environment.

However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.","10.1007/s00253-013-5104-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329308","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894298106&doi=10.1007%2fs00253-013-5104-6&partnerID=40&md5=9aef56de1efef0314e84be799212a6ac"

By investigating these microstructural processes with rheological investigations, it is possible to achieve a better understanding of soil behaviour from the mesoscale (soil aggregates) to macroscale (bulk soil). In this paper, a rheological investigation of the factors influencing microstructural stability of riparian soils was conducted. Homogenized samples of Marshland soils from the riparian zone of the Elbe River (North Germany) were analyzed with amplitude sweeps (AS) under controlled shear deformation in a modular compact rheometer MCR 300 (Anton Paar, Germany) at different matric potentials. A range physicochemical parameters were determined (texture, pH, organic matter, CaCO3 etc.) and these factors were used to parameterize pedotransfer functions.The results indicate a clear dependence of microstructural elasticity on texture and water content. Although the influence of individual physicochemical factors varies depending on texture, the relevant features were identified taking combined effects into account. Thus, stabilizing factors are: organic matter, calcium ions, CaCO3 and pedogenic iron oxides; whereas sodium ions and water content represent structurally unfavorable factors. Based on the determined statistical relationships between rheological and physicochemical parameters, pedotransfer functions (PTF) have been developed.","10.1515/johh-2017-0031","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329315",NA

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterization the spatial-temporal patterns of S. alternifiora soils is thus essential for the assessment of the pace of ecosystem development. However, the determination of soil properties by traditional analysis almost impossible achieve a timely detection of soil changes that is generally required by soil monitoring tasks for demonstrating impacts of S. alternifiora invasion. This work focused on the use of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) for characterizing soils and predicting key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alterniflora areas. A set of soil profiles representing a chronosequence of S. alternifiora invasion was used, comprising 45 samples from 15 sites. The results showed that approximately 20-year of S. alterniflora invasion has altered soil characteristics especially in the topsoil. Changes of soil associated with sampling horizons and ages of S. alternifiora could be distinguishable using soil variables and VNIRS, and high correlations were found between soils and spectra information. The results of predictions showed that predictive accuracy for salinity, pH, clay, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, organic carbon and calcium carbonate were acceptable, but models for total nitrogen, bulk density, sand and silt were less satisfactory. These results suggested the possibility of VNIRS for the rapid assessment of key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alternifiora areas. This work highlights that VNIRS technique could be taken as a useful tool to investigate soil changes and explore understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114138","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329323","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076825367&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2019.114138&partnerID=40&md5=176624891bf7a695f0365e2bf250eaea"

Spatio-temporal distributions of the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks therein are affected by both biological and environmental factors. In this paper, spatio-temporal distribution and vertical distribution (0-50 cm) of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in the Dongtan wetlands during 2013 was studied. Results show that both the SOC and TN stocks varied seasonally, following an order of winter > autumn > summer > spring, and accumulated with the time passing by, and varied spatially, too, showing a decreasing order of Phagmites australis belt in high tidal marsh > Spartina alterniflora belt in medium-tidal marsh > Scirpus mariqueter belt in low-tidal marsh > bare mudflat. However, along the belts, regardless of vegetation, the SOC and TN stocks was higher in the northern transect than in the middle and southern transects. Vertically the stocks distributed in the soil profiles in similar patterns in all areas. Generally SOC stock peaked in the >10-15 cm soil layer in the mudflat and S. mariqueter marsh, and in the surface soil layer(0-10 cm soil layer) and the >20-30 cm soil layer in the P. australis marsh and S. alterniflora marsh. The vertical distribution of TN stock was quite similar to that of SOC stock, showing an extremely significant positive correlation (P<0.01).

The impacts of this alien species S. alterniflora on intertidal ecosystem processes in the Jiangsu coastland were investigated by comparing the sediment nutrient availability and trace element concentration characteristics in a mudflat and those of a four-year old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. At each study site, fifteen plots were sampled in different seasons to determine the sediment characteristics along the tidal flats. The results suggested that Spartina salt marsh sediments had significantly higher total N, available P, and water content, but lower pH and bulk density than mudflat sediments. Sediment salinity, water content, total N, organic C, and available P decreased along a seaward gradient in the Spartina salt marsh and increased with vegetation biomass. Furthermore, the concentrations of trace elements and some metal elements in the sediment were higher under Spartina although these increases were not significant. Also, in the Spartina marsh, some heavy metals were concentrated in the surface layer of the sediment. The Spartina salt marsh in this study was only four years old; therefore, it is suggested that further study of this alien species on a longer time frame in the Jiangsu coastland should be carried out.","10.1016/S1002-0160(07)60105-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329338","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-37449030661&doi=10.1016%2fS1002-0160%2807%2960105-2&partnerID=40&md5=2433407d44fe2e40c59dcd51b0f12835"

A low-salinity tidal flat, dominated by Trochamminita salsa, Haplophragmoides spp. and Cribrostomoides spp., prevailed from AD 140-1360 (Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages, Medieval Climatic Anomaly). This sheltered environment was affected by high hydrodynamic episodes, marked by the increase in silt/clay ratio, decrease of organic matter, and poor and weakly preserved foraminiferal assemblages, suggesting enhanced river runoff. The establishment of low marsh began at AD 1380. This low-salinity environment, marked by colder and wet conditions, persisted from AD 1410-1770 (Little Ice Age), when foraminiferal density increased significantly. Haplophragmoides manilaensis and Trochamminita salsa mark the transition from low to high marsh at AD 1730. Since AD 1780 the abundances of salt marsh species (Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata) increased, accompanied by a decrease in foraminiferal density, reflecting climate instability, when droughts alternate with severe floods.

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from 12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 , which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas. Belowground C pool loss was 36% less for S. patens than S. alterniflora and was similar between S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus. Accretion and C accumulation rates were greater in the S. alterniflora-dominated stand than in the J. roemerianus-dominated stand.

The sites differed from each other in (1) the amount of tidal flushing, (2) vegetation, (3) redox condition below the sediment-water interface, (4) carbon content and (5) solid phase iron oxyhydroxide and iron sulfide content of the sediment. The calculated degree of pyritization (DOP) varies between 0.44 and 1.0, depending on the site and the season. Different DOP values were obtained for the same samples when different techniques were applied for extraction of reactive iron. Framboidal pyrite was dominant; however, other textural forms of pyrite were also observed. The size distribution of the individual pyrite crystals and the framboids was fairly narrow; with the majority of them having diameters < 10 mum. Despite deposition taking place in aerobic waters (fully oxygenated waters) at the sampled sites, both the DOP and pyrite textures indicated dysoxic (waters with low oxygen concentrations) to euxinic (waters with no oxygen present, and H2S may be continually or intermittently present) bottom waters. These results indicate that caution must be applied when using DOP and pyrite morphologies as proxies for interpreting the redox conditions of different depositional environments.

Salt marshes, because of their location between upland regions and coastal waters and their recognized role as nutrient transformers, have the potential to ameliorate some of this loading. In the current study, we used core incubations in the laboratory to investigate denitrification rates in high marsh soils from five fringing salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. The marshes showed a wide variety of terrestrial N loading, with rates ranging from 2 to 6037 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Field-collected cores were selected to include both vegetated and bare soils at each marsh, and the six-hour incubations were designed to approximate natural tidal rhythms. Total dissolved nitrogen flux in these marshes ranged between + 1255 and -710 mumol N m(-2) hr(-1), with N-2 gas accounting for the majority of the total N flux (average 76%). Nitrogen gas flux ranged between -375 (nitrogen fixation) and +420 (denitrification) mumol N-2 m(-2) hr(-1). While N-2 gas fluxes were significantly correlated (r = +0.64, p < 0.05) with marsh organic carbon content, we also detected a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.91, P < 0.05) between average N-2 gas fluxes and terrestrial nitrogen loads. Comparison of N-2 gas fluxes in vegetated vs. bare soils indicated a significant (p < 0.05) but variable effect of vegetation on N-2 flux. This field survey shows the potential of New England fringe salt marshes to intercept and transform land-derived nitrogen loads; however, sediment characteristics (e.g., percent of labile organic matter) and plant community structure can significantly affect the capacity of the marsh to process inorganic nitrogen loads. In order to understand the role of salt marshes in buffering coastal N loading, we need a better understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling denitrification and net N losses.","10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0870:DIFSMO]2.0.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329354","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-25144451281&doi=10.1672%2f0277-5212%282004%29024%5b0870%3aDIFSMO%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=0bb6f51595868df50088d819b9994986"

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.","10.1002/ecs2.2556","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329356","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010"

Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the East Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2 to 16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: 1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, 2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and 3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

The marshes had similar geomorphology (embayment), elevation (streamside and backmarsh), tidal inundation (1 m), salinity (25-35 ppt), soil type (Carteret series), and plant species composition (Spartina alterniflora Loisel) but differed with respect to the presence or absence of ponies. Over a two year period, above and belowground (0-30 cm depth) biomass were significantly lower in the grazed marsh (aboveground = 196-400 g/m2, belowground = 828-1049 g/m2) than the ungrazed marsh (aboveground = 588-671 g/m2; belowground = 4,921-6,730 g/m2). Reduction in Spartina biomass at the grazed marsh resulted in less soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus than at the ungrazed marsh. There was no difference in C:N ratios at the two marshes, but N:P ratios were higher in the ungrazed marsh (9:1-19:1) than the grazed marsh (6:1-11:1), suggesting that more N is available for marsh organisms at the ungrazed site. Total benthic infauna density did not differ between the grazed (31,265 organisms/m2) and ungrazed (45,511 organisms/m2) marshes. However, the density of subsurface deposit feeders was significantly lower in the grazed marsh (10,370 organisms/m2) than in the ungrazed marsh (16,877 organisms/m2), perhaps as a result of lower soil organic matter and reduced food availability. Our findings suggested that herbivory by feral ponies co-ops primary productivity that would otherwise enter the detritus based salt marsh food web.

Correlation analysis showed that these trace elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture, sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values. Principal component analysis showed that the sampling season affected by the flow-sediment regulation regime was the dominant factor influencing the distribution patterns of these trace elements in soils, and plant community type was another important factor. The findings of this study could contribute to wetland conservation and management in coastal regions affected by the hydrological engineering.","10.1371/journal.pone.0107738","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329365","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929145188&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0107738&partnerID=40&md5=c0f79bd812a9b7787a4fbcb79361829f"

We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.","10.1007/s12237-013-9702-4","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329372","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84916928312&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-013-9702-4&partnerID=40&md5=ad766c7cd66eb49c2f4f8f44f5853340"

Wetland soil bacterial communities varied across both space and time, with all measured variables (temperature, pH, percentage of soil organic matter, salinity, and concentrations of sulfide, NH4+, NO3-, and soluble reactive phosphorus) showing significant site by time interactions. Analyses of bacterial communities showed both marsh zones (Spartina and Cladium) supported similar communities, as did the ecotone and coastal forest. Bacterial communities within coastal forest soils were significantly different than those within marsh soils, and the ecotone communities were significantly different from the Spartina marsh soil. Temperature and pH were the most influential environmental factors impacting bacterial community composition but no predictable patterns were identified, suggesting that community changes are likely the result of intrinsic factors that are affected by local-scale processes.

However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity. Also, rhizospheres exerted a major control on increasing MBC and MBP but rarely affected bacterial community composition or diversity.","10.1007/s10021-019-00468-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329374","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075990620&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-019-00468-5&partnerID=40&md5=5a74a2c7b32baeb3c4fae87fbcbe725d"

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the associations of QS signal molecules with the dynamics and activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria in intertidal marshes.","10.1007/s11104-020-04630-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329375","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088457477&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-020-04630-0&partnerID=40&md5=730d3d0880a49f17210dd0025c8ffc52"

A combination of measurements from different-age created marshes as well as periodic measurements over time on two marshes were used to (1) document rates of wetland pedogenesis, especially soil organic matter, and, (2) explore relationships between soil and benthic invertebrate community development. Soil macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat), organic C and N increased and bulk density decreased during the 25 years following marsh establishment. The most dramatic changes in bulk density, MOM, C and N occurred within the upper 10 cm of the soil with lesser changes below this depth. Created marshes were sinks for organic C (90-140 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) and N (7-11 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) but not for P (0-1 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1). The density of benthic invertebrates (>250 mum) and subsurface-deposit feeding oligochaetes also increased over time on created salt marshes. Invertebrate and oligochaete density were strongly related to MOM content (r2 = 0.83-0.87) and soil organic C (r2 = 0.52-0.82) and N (r2 = 0.62-0.84). These findings suggest that, in created salt marshes, development of the benthic invertebrate community is tied to marsh soil formation, especially accumulation of organic matter as MOM and soil.

Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes. Our study indicates that instead of CO2 being simply incorporated into PCS and SCS, carbon dynamics following Spartina invasion are more complicated.

The sediment-poor, organic-rich nature of many Southern New England salt marshes makes them particularly vulnerable to these changes. In order to assess how marsh accretion has changed over time, we returned to Narragansett Bay, RI where salt marsh vertical accretion rates were documented almost 30 years ago. Using radionuclide tracers (Pb-210 and Cs-137), we observe no significant change in overall accretion rates (0.27-0.69 cm year(-1)) compared to historical averages (0.24-0.60 cm year(-1)), but we document a shift in how these marshes maintain elevation. Organic matter now plays a smaller role in contributing to vertical accretion across all study sites, declining by 22 % on average. We attribute this reduction to potentially higher decomposition rates fueled by higher water temperature. Inorganic matter also contributes less to accretion (declining by 44 % on average at marshes located more internal to the estuary), likely due to diminishing sediment supply in this region. With organic and inorganic solids accounting for less of the total accretion, several of the marshes are experiencing symptoms of swelling, with water and porespace contributing more towards accretion compared to historical values. Accretion rates (0.27-0.45 cm year(-1)) at these organic-rich (> 40 % sediment organic matter) marshes are predominantly lower than the current (30 years) rate of RSLR (0.41 +/- 0.07 cm year(-1)). These results, combined with the increased rate of RSLR and the hardened shorelines inhibiting landward migration, call into question the long-term survivability of these marshes.","10.1007/s12237-015-9971-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329381","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929643475&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-015-9971-1&partnerID=40&md5=1b18b06bd6988f82953a55068e4b0657"

Accretion rates are compared to a number of factors assumed to influence vertical marsh accretion: rates of relative sea-level rise, climatic parameters (average daily temperatures and degree days) and latitude (related to insolation and day length), sediment characteristics (organic matter inventory, bulk, mineral, and organic matter density), distance of the core site from the nearest source of tidal waters, and the tidal range. Unique to our study is a consideration of climatic parameters and latitude, which should influence organic matter production, and thus vertical accretion rates. Significant predictors of accretion rates (in order of importance) were found to be organic matter inventory, distance from a creek, and range of mean tides. Contrary to conclusions from previous studies, we found that accretion rates decreased with increasing tidal range, probably because we considered a wider span of tidal ranges, from micro- to macrotidal. Although four marshes with low organic matter inventories also show a deficit in accretion with respect to relative sea-level rise, organic matter is not limiting in two-thirds of the marshes studied, despite shorter growing seasons.","10.1007/BF02803561","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329387","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2142813967&doi=10.1007%2fBF02803561&partnerID=40&md5=56f6690286422577c1c7b54b3f5430d3"

We used bulk stable isotopic, chemical biomarker analyses, and aerial imagery analysis to identify changes in OC wetland sources, and radiotracers (Cs-137 and Pb-210) for chronology. Soil cores were collected at two sites at Port Aransas, Texas (USA), Harbor Island and Mud Island.Stable isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of all soil samples ranged from -26.8 to -15.6 parts per thousand and 1.8-10.4 parts per thousand and showed a significant trend of increasing depletion for each isotope from bottom to surface soils. The most depleted delta C-13 values were in surface soils at the Mud Island (Mangrove 2) location. Carbon sequestration rates were greater in mangroves and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 sites ranged from 253 to 270 and 101-125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively.

Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.","10.1007/s10533-013-9841-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329390","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884908191&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-013-9841-5&partnerID=40&md5=81ab1ba74ae73fb8e9a3d9c5834953a4"

Spartina alterniflora, one of typical salt marsh plant grows forcefully along the coast of China, has invaded the native mangrove habitats in Zhangjiang Estuary. However, the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on soil carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission from mangroves are not fully understood. Accordingly, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the soil CH4 and CO2 emission during growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 at four adjacent wetlands, namely bare mudflat (Mud), Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM) and S. alterniflora (SA). Potential methane production (PMP), potential methane oxidation (PMO), functional microbial abundance and soil biogeochemical properties were measured simultaneously. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion could dramatically increase soil CH4 emissions mainly due to the enhancement in PMP which facilitated by soil EC, MBC, TOC and mcrA gene abundance. Additionally, S. alterniflora invasion decreases soil CO2 emission. Both heterotrophic microbial respiration (165 rRNA) and methane oxidation (pmoA and ANME-pmoA) are responsible for CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, S. alterniflora invasion greatly increases GWP by stimulating CH4 emissions. Thus, comparing with mangroves, invasive S. alterniflora significantly (p < 0.001) increases CH4 emission while reduces CO2 emission.","10.1038/s41598-018-27625-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329394","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048758369&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-27625-5&partnerID=40&md5=c8fd548c5d28e55bf716f4205ac2a2c7"

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329399","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d"

Results demonstrate that correlations between soil POC contents and delta C-13 values of the salt marsh cores were similar to those between soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and delta C-13 values of the upper soil layers of mountainous soil profiles with different altitudes. SOM of salt marsh was generally younger than 100 years, and originated mainly from topsoil erosions in catchments of the Yangtze River. Correlations of TN content with C/N ratio, POC content with TIC content and POC content with delta C-13 values for the cores suggest that turnover degrees of SOM from the salt marsh are overall low, and trends of SOM turnover are clear from the bare flat to the high tidal flat. Bare flat samples show characteristics of original sediments, with minor SOM turnover. Turnover processes of SOM have occurred and are discernable in the high and middle tidal flats, and the mixing degrees of SOM compartments with different turnover rates increase with evolution of the muddy tidal flat. The exclusive strata structure of alternate muddy laminae and silty laminae originated from dynamic depositional processes on muddy tidal flat was a great obstacle to vertical migration of dissolved materials, and SOM turnover was then constrained.

Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (delta C-13), and age ((FC)-C-14) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented similar to 9%-17% of shallow SOC (<= 26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.Key Points.Salt marsh soils preserved compounds with a range of reactivities that were derived from local grasses9%-17% of surface soil carbon was old, likely reflecting redeposition of eroded creekbank materialDecomposition decreases soil organic carbon thermal reactivity, and disturbances accelerate this shift, particularly in surface horizons","10.1029/2020GL090287","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329403","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099777956&doi=10.1029%2f2020GL090287&partnerID=40&md5=718ae426665bb4b6e02a6420ba5a8348"

The site was chosen to represent northern, loch head marshes and to test different coring techniques in organic rich soils. The data provides a quantitative measure of the dry bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon content present within the soils of the Kyle of Tongue saltmarsh. A total of 4 cores were collected, 39 samples were collected at 10cm intervals down the length of each core. The samples were processed for bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon content which was quantified through elemental analysis. The data were collected to help create a detailed picture of saltmarsh carbon storage in the soils of UK saltmarsh and test different coring approaches. The cores were collected by the data authors in November 2018. The work was carried out under the NERC programme - Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environment (C-SIDE), NERC grant reference NE/R010846/1 Soil cores were collected using the hammer coring technique, where a PVC pipe was manually driven into the soil. The location of the cores was recorded using DGPS. Prior to analysis, the cores were split, the soil profile described using the Troel-smith scheme and fixed volumetric (4cm3) samples collected at 10cm intervals down the length of each core. Dry bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon data was produced using standard analytical procedures (detailed in the supporting documentation).

J.","2017","Geochemical analyses reveal the importance of environmental history for blue carbon sequestration","Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia. Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands are known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level, and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four corestwo collected from marine-influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo marine site (WAP-M) and Port Stephens marine site (POR-M)) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo fluvial site (WAP-F) and Port Stephens fluvial site (POR-F))highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C; however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.","10.1002/2017JG003775","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329408","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027545370&doi=10.1002%2f2017JG003775&partnerID=40&md5=1fc3ce460a6d59e8ce50432dfbadc3c5"

As the soil respiration increased, the percent carbon (C) and N in the soil surface layer decreased in the S. alterniflora, suggesting that in part, the increased soil respiration rates are contributing to the increased turnover of labile organic matter. In contrast, there were no apparent relationships between the soil respiration rates in the high marsh and the soil C and N contents of the surface layer. However, there was a broad-scale pattern and significant inverse relationship between the high marsh soil respiration rates and the landscape belowground biomass of S. patens.

The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

This study investigates the possibility of using soil testate amoebae assemblages of a brackish tidal marsh (Scheldt estuary, Belgium) as a proxy for water level changes. On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone's testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (similar to elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh. Testate amoeba assemblages in such a brackish habitat show thus a vertical zonation (RMSEP: 0.19 m) that is comparable to the vertical zonation of testate amoebae and other protists on freshwater tidal marshes and salt marshes.","10.4467/16890027AP.12.022.0768","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329420",NA

However, little information is available on the relationship between hydrologic conditions and denitrification. In this study three typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including short-term flooding wetlands (STFW), seasonal-flooding wetlands (SFW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) were chosen as the study sites in the Yellow River Delta. In contrast, five typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including 100-year floodplain (H), 10-year floodplain (T), 5-year floodplain (F), 1-year floodplain (O) and permanently flooded floodplain (B) were chosen as the study sites in Xianghai wetlands. This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes. Generally, higher flooding frequencies will cause higher denitrification rates in salt marshes. Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes. Therefore, the changes in soil properties (e.g. SOM, TN, pH and salinity) can become an important way to control NO3- levels in inland salt marshes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the results of integrated analyses of the core, including its sedimentary lithology, grain size, foraminiferal abundance, chemical elements, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. The sedimentary environment has evolved from a fluvial-deposit, limnetic-deposit, littoral-deposit, shallow sea deposit, and finally to a delta-deposit environment since 40,000 cal yr BP. Environmentally induced differences in apparent mass accumulation rates (AMARs) of organic carbon (OC) have been significant; they have ranged between 3.73 and 30.77 g/(m(2)yr). The fact that the highest rates were associated with the delta-deposit environment indicates that the rate of carbon sequestration was greater in the sediments of estuarine wetlands than sediments of the continental shelf. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) proxy responded to several cold events, and there was a positive correlation between the CIA and OC-AMAR.

However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ""reclaimed,"" that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.","10.1029/2000GB001346","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329429","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035693360&doi=10.1029%2f2000GB001346&partnerID=40&md5=f05816b803c4320bb6abab7804d776eb"

The objective was to compare soil development of these soils with processes known for natural saline marsh soil development and to evaluate the presented form of artificial land recovery against the background of increasing population densities in China. Electrical conductivity (water) and exchangeable sodium percentage decreased rapidly after reclamation started. The decrease in pH and carbonate content suggest an incipient decalcification. Soil organic carbon decreased in the first 30 cm within 20 years, caused by mineralization of the organic sea sediments. After this process an accumulation of soil organic carbon due to organic matter input as a result of farming was observed. At all sites total contents of calcium, magnesium and potassium were classified as elevated to high and decreased slightly within 31 years after reclamation and commencement of agricultural use. Only total phosphorus increased after construction of embankments, attributed to the application of fertilizer phosphorus. Available nutrient contents developed differently but none showed significant trends. Calcium slightly decreased as an effect of reclamation. Processes of pedogenesis were comparable to those known for natural marshes, but had an initial character. The reclamation of land in the presented manner is considered important to support high and growing population densities in China.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.","10.1111/1745-5871.12265","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329442","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041931644&doi=10.1111%2f1745-5871.12265&partnerID=40&md5=defbb7877f8a0add9526633acb3f68fa"

Analysis of bulk-organic sediment and plant samples collected along transects at two sites in North Carolina, USA demonstrates that sediment delta C-13 values can be used to distinguish between Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh (C photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -17.6 parts per thousand to 16.1 parts per thousand) and Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh (C-3 photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -28.2 parts per thousand to -21.8 parts per thousand) environments. Juncus roemerianus plants undergo little decompositional change in delta C-13 (average 0.8 parts per thousand), although there is a clear difference between Spartina alterniflora tissue and bulk-organic sediments (approximately 4 parts per thousand). C:N ratios on bulk-organic sediment from freshwater upland and salt-marsh environments converge during early diagenesis, rendering them of little use in reconstructing RSL. The utility of delta C-13 values as a sea-level indicator is limited by the elevational range of C-4 plants, making it difficult to recognize salt-marsh subenvironments and improve the precision of RSL reconstructions. Furthermore, Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh and freshwater upland sediments cannot be adequately distinguished with delta C-13 values.","10.1177/0959683609354302","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329444",NA

"GEN",14329448,"Nolte, Stefanie","2020","Dataset: Does livestock grazing affect sediment deposition and accretion rates in salt marshes?","Accretion rates, defined as the vertical growth of salt marshes measured in mm per year, may be influenced by grazing livestock in two ways: directly, by increasing soil compaction through trampling, and indirectly, by reducing aboveground biomass and thus decreasing sediment deposition rates measured in g/m2 per year. Although accretion rates and the resulting surface elevation change largely determine the resilience of salt marshes to sea-level rise (SLR), the effect of livestock grazing on accretion rates has been little studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of livestock grazing on salt-marsh accretion rates. We hypothesize that accretion will be lower in grazed compared to ungrazed salt marshes. In four study sites along the mainland coast of the Wadden Sea (in the south-eastern North Sea), accretion rates, sediment deposition rates, and soil compaction of grazed and ungrazed marshes were analysed using the 137Cs radionuclide dating method. Accretion rates were on average 11.6 mm yr-1 during recent decades and thus higher than current and projected rates of SLR. Neither accretion nor sediment deposition rates were significantly different between grazing treatments. Meanwhile, soil compaction was clearly affected by grazing with significantly higher dry bulk density on grazed compared to ungrazed parts. Based on these results, we conclude that other factors influence whether grazing has an effect on accretion and sediment deposition rates and that the effect of grazing on marsh growth does not follow a direct causal chain. It may have a great importance when interacting with other biotic and abiotic processes on the marsh. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329448",NA

Unfortunately, the economic cost associated with assessing the effectiveness of restoration is prohibitive and more information is needed about the trajectory and timing of restoration outcomes to improve restoration practices. Microbial communities provide essential salt marsh functions so assessing the degree to which microbial communities in restored marshes resemble reference marshes can serve as a proxy indicator for the potential return of microbial function. We studied a recently restored marsh located on Cape Cod, MA, USA, by examining shifts in the microbial community and sediment edaphic properties in three habitats of a degraded oligohaline marsh, both before and after restoration of tidal flooding and in comparison with three nearbyS. alterniflorareference marshes that never had flow restrictions. We hypothesized that the microbial community would respond rapidly to the restoration and that over time these communities would be indistinguishable from reference marsh communities. We found that soil edaphic characteristics shifted along a trajectory of recovery toward the reference marshes, with increases in salinity and decreases in soil organic matter, percentage of carbon, and percentage of nitrogen. The microbial communities in all three habitats within the restored marsh were different from reference marshes, and both the prokaryotic and fungal communities withinP. australisandTyphasp. habitats became more similar to reference marshes (similarities increasing from an average of 5 to 16% for prokaryotes and 3 to 10% for fungi) during the first 2 years after restoration. In that same time period, by contrast, there was no return of the native marsh vegetation. These results suggest that shifts in microbial community structure occur prior to shifts in marsh vegetation and may facilitate the successful revegetation of restored marshes. Understanding the recovery trajectory of marshes during restoration and the role that microbes play in promoting the long-term sustainability of these habitats is essential; these results suggest that microbial communities respond rapidly and in a positive direction to restoration efforts.","10.1007/s12237-020-00719-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329450","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081895199&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-020-00719-y&partnerID=40&md5=1744c7a431470dc4f2fd09fe5c143ed6"

Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.","10.1007/s12237-021-00943-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329451","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105414697&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-021-00943-0&partnerID=40&md5=041e238f5d27b7348566177124046949"

Hammer coring reduces the thickness of the soil profile and increases the dry bulk density, which results in an overestimation of the soil OC stock of up to 22%. In saltmarshes with multiple different soil units, we show that hammer coring is unsuitable for the calculation of OC stocks and should be avoided in favour of Russian or gouge cores. Compaction changes both soil dry bulk density and porosity and we show that resultant radiometric chronologies are compromised, almost doubling mass accumulation rates. While we show that the OC (%) content of these sediments is largely unchanged by coring method, the implication for OC burial rates are profound because of the significant effect of hammer coring on the calculation of soil mass accumlation rates.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114180","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329454","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078040315&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2020.114180&partnerID=40&md5=3d723a4f247cfecda7d59acb459b23de"

The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby.

With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.","10.1007/s11104-012-1564-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329462",NA

Cs-137 accretion and accumulation of organic C and N were three to five times greater in freshwater-dominated marshes than in salt marshes. The patterns observed in Georgia marshes were geographically general; data for tidal freshwater and brackish marsh soils compiled from 61 studies in the conterminous United States showed lower bulk density and higher percent organic C and N than salt marshes, regardless of geographic region. Salinity, a proxy for freshwater input, was inversely correlated with percent soil organic C and N and with vertical accretion in Georgia marshes and in marshes elsewhere in the conterminous United States. There was no relationship between above- or belowground emergent plant production and salinity of Georgia marshes but the rate of root decomposition was positively related to salinity, and decomposition rate was negatively related to percent soil organic C and C accumulation.

Seasonal variation in soil and bacterial properties were investigated within the nebkhas under the canopy of Halocnemum strobilaceum and in the surrounding unvegetated sites at salt marshes of Lake Manzala. The parameters measured include soil moisture, organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bacterial community and enzyme characteristics. Enrichment ratios for soil salinity and nutrients were evaluated to indicate the salinity and fertility islands within nebkhas. Soil moisture content showed significant differences between the different seasons with the highest value in winter (16.55%) at unvegetated control site. Soil electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and phosphorus had their significantly higher values in nebkhas during autumn. The enrichment values for the measured soil parameters ranged from 0.31 to 4.09 in the four seasons which indicates a clear accumulation effect for soil nutrients and salts within the nebkhas under the canopy of H. strobilaceum. Bacterial abundance was consistently higher in nebkhas through all seasons. Eleven genera of bacteria belong to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and proteobacteria phyla were recorded in nebkha and unvegetated sites. These genera varied in their occurrence between the two locations and the four seasons. It can be concluded that the formation of nebkhas by halophytic vegetation have noticeable effects on accumulation of soil salinity and fertility during different seasons that affect bacterial abundance and activity in coastal environment.","10.21608/ejbo.2017.811.1051","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329466",NA

Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities. MethodologyBuilding upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and SLR assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios. Principal FindingsModel results indicated that under a high rate of SLR (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (&#8722;0.2 m MHHW) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on SLR and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats. Conclusions/SignificanceResults suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-SLR scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas.

Results from the four cores - two collected from marine influenced saltmarshes (WAP-M and POR-M) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (WAP-F and POR-F) - highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. 13C NMR analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments.

Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks.

The results of this study suggest that (1) anthropogenic alteration of the land cover in the watersheds of tidal creek-salt marsh systems may increase the organic contaminant loadings in the sediment, and (2) tidal creek-salt marsh sediments, particularly in the creek channel, are repositories and potentially conduits of organic contaminants from the upland environment to the deeper estuarine areas.","10.1007/s002449900540","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329475","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032704089&doi=10.1007%2fs002449900540&partnerID=40&md5=8bdae7112737384c311e397322b241df"

L.","2013","Grazing effects on microbial community composition, growth and nutrient cycling in salt marsh and sand dune grasslands","The effect of grazing by large herbivores on the microbial community and the ecosystem functions they provide are relatively unknown in grassland systems. In this study, the impact of grazing upon the size, composition and activity of the soil microbial community was measured in field experiments in two coastal ecosystems: one salt marsh and one sand dune grassland. Bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass were not systematically affected by grazing across ecosystems, although, within an ecosystem, differences could be detected. Fungal-to-bacterial ratio did not differ with grazing for either habitat. Redundancy analysis showed that soil moisture, bulk density and root biomass significantly explained the composition of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers, dominated by the distinction between the two grassland habitats, but where the grazing effect could also be resolved. PLFA markers for Gram-positive bacteria were more proportionally abundant in un-grazed, and markers for Gram-negative bacteria in grazed grasslands. Bacterial growth rate (leucine incorporation) was highest in un-grazed salt marsh but did not vary with grazing intensity in the sand dune grassland. We conclude that grazing consistently affects the composition of the soil microbial community in semi-natural grasslands but that its influence is small (7 % of the total variation in PLFA composition), compared with differences between grassland types (89 %). The relatively small effect of grazing translated to small effects on measurements of soil microbial functions, including N and C mineralisation. This study is an early step toward assessing consequences of land-use change for global nutrient cycles driven by the microbial community.","10.1007/s00374-012-0721-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329477",NA

Lipids, insoluble non-hydrolysable macromolecular organic matter and black carbon fractions were isolated and examined via Rock-Eval pyrolysis, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) methods and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Integration of bulk Rock-Eval data, elemental and isotopic composition, together with spectroscopic features, suggested immature Type III organic matter derived mainly from C-3 vascular plants. The distribution of n-alkanes from the non-aromatic lipid fraction exhibited the importance of emergent macrophytes and terrestrial plants, as well as a moderate input of submerged/floating macrophytes to the source biomass. Mathematical deconvolution of a Rock-Eval pyrogram revealed highly heterogeneous organic matter composed of a mixture of thermally labile biopolymers (36%) at various stages of decomposition, as well as humic substances and highly refractory organic matter (64%) in the whole sample. Markedly lower heterogeneity and aliphaticity, together with a higher proportion of humic substances and highly refractory organic matter (ca. 84%) were observed in the macromolecular fraction. An abundant contribution of black carbon to the macromolecular fraction was indicated by mathematical deconvolution of the Rock-Eval pyrogram and was clearly shown by the isolation of this fraction and chemical oxidation. The black carbon fraction appeared to account for ca. half of the macromolecular fraction, the carbon in these two fractions representing 30% and 14% of the initial carbon, respectively. The electron microscopy observations directly evidenced the presence of black carbon, which was comprised of both amorphous poorly organized particles and highly ordered onion-shaped particles.

Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17 g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8 years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

In this study, the bacterial 16S gene was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform for bacterial identification and taxonomy. We investigated the (i) soil bacterial diversity and community composition in natural marsh, moderate and severe intensity of interference in wetlands, and (ii) the relationship between soil physical and chemical properties, and soil bacterial community structures in order to understand the effects of interference intensities on the marsh soil environment in the Sanjiang Plain wetland, Northeast China. The natural marsh soil contained most of 573 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between all the three sites (n=1241), while wetland soils of moderate and severe intensity of interference had only 510 and 401 OTUs, respectively. The soil bacterial diversity and richness indices of all disturbed wetlands presented a decline at the OTU level, alpha diversity (Shannon diversity and Chao and Ace diversities). In addition, the composition of soil bacterial communities showed different trends and structure after the disturbance. There were significant variation in unclassified genera and some dominant genera (relative abundance>1% in at least one site) between natural marsh and difference in interference intensities in disturbed wetlands, including Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi and Gemmatimonadetes. Composition of soil bacterial community was affected by Soil Moisture, pH, Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Available Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Available Phosphorus, Total Potassium, Nitrate Nitrogen, Available Potassium and Ammonium Nitrogen.

The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.","10.1007/s00442-012-2356-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329486","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867501387&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-012-2356-2&partnerID=40&md5=1ad42024ac95f1ab7f473d1a884c9b45"

We conducted experiments across a latitudinal and climate gradient of tidal marshes in the northeast Pacific to evaluate the effects of climate- and vegetation-related factors on litter decomposition. We manipulated tidal exposure and litter type in experimental mesocosms at two sites and used variation across marsh landscapes at seven sites to test for relationships between decomposition and marsh elevation, soil temperature, vegetation composition, litter quality, and sediment organic content. A greater than tenfold increase in manipulated tidal inundation resulted in small increases in decomposition of roots and rhizomes of two species, but no significant change in decay rates of shoots of three other species. In contrast, across the latitudinal gradient, decomposition rates of Salicornia pacifica litter were greater in high marsh than in low marsh. Rates were not correlated with sediment temperature or organic content, but were associated with plant assemblage structure including above-ground cover, species composition, and species richness. Decomposition rates also varied by litter type; at two sites in the Pacific Northwest, the grasses Deschampsia cespitosa and Distichlis spicata decomposed more slowly than the forb S. pacifica. Our data suggest that elevation gradients and vegetation structure in tidal marshes both affect rates of litter decay, potentially leading to complex spatial patterns in sediment carbon dynamics. Climate change may thus have direct effects on rates of decomposition through increased inundation from sea-level rise and indirect effects through changing plant community composition.","10.1007/s10021-017-0111-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329487","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011589278&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-017-0111-6&partnerID=40&md5=9fb98ed72241123539f01ac90fc2c45d"

Disturbances, such as eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus (August) and traced into lipids representing benthic microalgae (BMA) and bacteria. Bacteria assimilated C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora at similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly transferred to BMA, likely via bacterial respiration. Overall, nutrient enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments. Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen enrichment effects were limited as well as provide a mechanism for retaining newly fixed and detrital carbon in coastal sediments.","10.3354/meps11587","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329490","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959449581&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11587&partnerID=40&md5=38b8071c2b1dac15c6e0246e23bfce3d"

The interaction between digestive tract bacteria and soil animal hosts is still poorly explored despite the importance of soil fauna for ecosystem processes. In this study, we investigated the interactions between the bacterial communities from the digestive tract of the litter-feeding, semi-terrestrial crustacean Orchestia gammarellus and those obtained from the environment; these organisms thrive in, i.e., soil and plant litter from salt marshes. We hypothesized that elevation is an important driver of soil and litter bacterial communities, which indirectly (via ingested soil and litter bacteria) influences the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of O. gammarellus. Indeed, our results revealed that elevation modulated soil and litter bacterial community composition along with soil organic matter content and the C:N ratio. Soil and plant litter differed in alpha diversity indexes (richness and diversity), and in the case of plant litter, both indexes increased with elevation. In contrast, elevation did not affect the composition of bacterial communities associated with O. gammarellus' digestive tract, suggesting selection by the host, despite the fact that a large component of the bacterial community was also detected in external sources. Importantly, Ca. Bacilloplasma and Vibrio were highly prevalent and abundant in the host. The taxonomic comparison of Ca. Bacilloplasma amplicon sequence variants across the host at different elevations suggested a phylogenetic divergence due to host habitat (i.e., marine or semi-terrestrial), thus supporting their potential functional role in the animal physiology.

With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and 210Pb dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered (""control"") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha-1year-1). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)).

There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.","10.1007/s10533-014-9989-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329519","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904805203&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-014-9989-7&partnerID=40&md5=a4d0e1ee5bb0b17de5a6be5f9f4a248c"

However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125378","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329528","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089093548&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.125378&partnerID=40&md5=e352c5c75411052cf4b385c4843ec9aa"

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time. We conclude that RSL reconstructions derived from salt-marsh sediment preserved beneath Eurasian sub-Arctic peatlands can provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the Fennoscandian and Eurasian ice sheets.","10.1111/bor.12233","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329530",NA

Here, we quantify how marsh erosion differs between saline and brackish marshes of the Mississippi Delta. We analyzed long-term (1932-2015) maps of marsh loss and developed an algorithm to distinguish edge erosion from interior loss. We found that the edge erosion rate remains nearly constant at decadal timescales, whereas interior loss varies by more than 100%. On average, roughly half of marsh loss can be attributed to edge erosion, the other half to interior loss. Based on data from 42 cores, brackish marsh soils had a lower bulk density (0.17 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3)), a higher organic content (43% vs. 26%), a lower shear strength (2.0 vs. 2.5 kPa), and a lower shear strength in the root layer (13.8 vs. 20.7 kPa) than saline marsh soils. We then modified an existing marsh edge erosion model by including a salinity-dependent erodibility. By calibrating the erodibility with the observed retreat rates, we found that the brackish marsh is two to three times more erodible than the saline marshes. Overall, this model advances the ability to simulate estuarine systems as a whole, thus transcending the salinity boundaries often used in compartmentalized marsh models.","10.1002/esp.5108","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329531",NA

This study used observations of natural variation and large-scale manipulative experiments to test the influence of vascular vegetation and soil organic matter on the rate and trajectory of macrofaunal recovery in a southern California created salt marsh, the Crown Point Mitigation Site. During the first three years following marsh establishment, macrofaunal density and species richness recovered rapidly within the Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) zone; densities in the created marsh were 50% of those in the natural marsh after 16 mo and 97% after 28 mo. However, the early successional assemblage had a lower proportion of tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes, and a higher proportion of chironomids and other insect larvae than did the mature natural marsh. Most of the colonizers arrived by rafting on sea grass and algae rather than by larval dispersal. Initial planting of S. foliosa had no influence on macrofaunal recovery, perhaps because of variable transplant survival. However, subsequently, both positive and negative correlations were observed between densities of some macrofaunal taxa and shoot densities of S. foliosa or Salicornia spp. (pickleweed). Salinity and measures of soil organics (belowground biomass, combustible organic matter, and chlorophyll a) also were correlated with macrofaunal densities and taxon richness. Of foul added soil amendments (kelp, alfalfa, peat, and Milorganite), Milorganite (a sewage product) and kelp both promoted macrofaunal colonization during year 1, but effects were short lived. The most significant sources of heterogeneity in the recovering marsh were associated with site history and climate variation. Faunal recovery was most rapid in highly localized, organic-rich marsh sediments that were remnants of the historical wetland. Elevated sea level during the 1998 El Nino corresponded with similarity of macrofaunal communities in the created and natural marshes. The large spatial scale and multi-year duration of this study revealed that natural sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may exert stronger influence on faunal succession in California wetlands than manipulation of vegetation or soil properties.","10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1785:NAMSOH]2.0.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329537","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036994925&doi=10.1890%2f1051-0761%282002%29012%5b1785%3aNAMSOH%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=ee758fde8083ed2e382cd95b660bfd1e"

Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance's National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this 'blue carbon' storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.","10.1007/s11852-020-00783-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329542","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094127101&doi=10.1007%2fs11852-020-00783-3&partnerID=40&md5=fed91066a5c03c00573a7d60b1f4a149"

Four sampling sites were established along the salinity and exposure gradient of Paranagua Bay in the winter and summer of 1992. At each site, 5 samples (0.02 m(2)corer) were taken in the salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated tidal flats. Sediment composition, salt marsh structure (stem height and density, live and dead above- and below-ground biomass of S. alterniflora) and vegetal detritus biomass were determined to assess whether they can affect the dynamics of macrobenthic invertebrates. The development of salt marshes and the amount of detritus, the latter mainly originated from adjacent mangroves, were determined by the energy and salinity gradients along the bay. Plant above- and below-ground components, together with detritus biomass, exert a strong influence on the composition and distribution of macrofauna in Paranagua Bay. Salt marshes support higher densities and species number of macrobenthic invertebrates. Multivariate analyses showed that oscillations of different fractions of Spartina alterniflora, as well as detritus availability, affect the different components of macrobenthic associations in a variable degree. Spatial and temporal shifts of infaunal organisms appear to be more evident than those of mobile epibenthic forms.","10.1023/A:1003753001411","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329547",NA

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.","10.6084/m9.figshare.11368025.v1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329548","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081009463&doi=10.1029%2f2019JG005217&partnerID=40&md5=b6a9e154be823aa420baa074068f6839"

However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.","10.1007/s11707-018-0680-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329549","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045061365&doi=10.1007%2fs11707-018-0680-5&partnerID=40&md5=66f99ad575a52e872053b662566736d2"

Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

B.","2019","A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit","Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Two years following the fire, vegetation percent cover in burned areas was significantly lower than in unburned areas, with dominant-species change in recovered areas, and NDVI was lower than pre-fire conditions. Multi-year disturbance, such as fire, presents challenges for salt marsh resilience and dependent species, especially in sites facing multiple stressors.

Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.","10.1029/2018GB005897","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329564","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047623402&doi=10.1029%2f2018GB005897&partnerID=40&md5=e45660cdfbade7aea8c8ed4eaf9f93a9"

Subsequently, distribution regularities of these measurement indicators are discussed, and the biogeochemistry processes between sediments and plants are also analysized. Lastly, the organic matter sources of different ecologic zones in tidal salt marsh are evaluated, and the organic matter accumulations in different ecologic zones induced by their plants are also compared. The results indicate that TOC, TN, C/N and a 13C show obviously zonal distribution. The organic matter sources are dominated by marine input in silt flat, Artemisia schrenkiana flat, and the transition zone between silt and Spartina alterniflora flat, and controlled by terrigenous input in Spartina alterniflora flat. Spartina alterniflora plays an important role in the accumulation of organic matter in the whole tidal salt marshes ecosystem. In study area, the annually increased TOC, organic matter and TN in Spartina alterniflora flat, Artemisia schrenkiana flat and reed flat respectively reach 6 451t, 16 595t and 536t.

To investigate the effects of different water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands, soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in four types of wetlands (i.e., restored tidal salt marshes (RTSM, covered with Suaeda salsa) and degraded tidal salt marshes (DTSM, bare land); freshwater restored wetlands (FRW) and degraded wetlands without freshwater inputs (DWFI), covered with Phragmites australis) during the period from August to October in 2015 in the Yellow River Delta, China. Our results showed that the mean values of total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in restored wetlands (e.g., RTSM and FRW) than those in degraded wetlands (e.g., DTSM and DWFI). Along the whole soil profile, TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC were higher in RTSM soils than those in DTSM soils except for TC and SOC in the 0-10 cm soils and DOC in the 40-50 cm soils. FRW soils contained higher TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC than DWFI except for DOC in the 0-10 cm soils. Soil TC density (TCD), SOC density (SOCD), ROOC density (ROOCD) and DOC density (DOCD) in the top 50 cm soils in restored wetlands were higher compared with degraded wetlands. Multivariate analysis showed that soil carbon was significantly influenced by EC, soil base cations and anions (e.g., K+, Ca2+ Cl- and SO42-), pH, TN, C/N ratio, bulk density (BD) and soil texture (p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that these two water and salinity regulation measures are effective in increasing soil carbon stocks of coastal wetlands.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.058","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329571","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039843056&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2017.10.058&partnerID=40&md5=d1fad6596cd3d348e3699874919a2fd1"

We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing. Additional research is needed, however, to better understand the interactions of nutrient enrichment and sea level rise on soil shear strength and stability of tidal salt marshes.","10.1002/ecs2.2329","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329574","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054087414&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2329&partnerID=40&md5=75159d18b35e9ef8759c8e5e46227bdb"

Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R-ECO and R-AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP. The invasion of S. alterniflora potentially induces a negative feedback to the global climate change by regulating the C sequestration in salt marsh ecosystems.","10.1002/clen.201300838","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329577","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928169051&doi=10.1002%2fclen.201300838&partnerID=40&md5=dac707a72e8e1e007ea9008860b66dd8"

The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.","10.1007/s10750-005-1114-4","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329580","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29444447285&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-005-1114-4&partnerID=40&md5=49f44b238f7baa8c12d0eefbce74b1c0"

One-centimeter increments of Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated sediment were analyzed for diatoms, pigments (phaeophytin and chlorophyll a), biogenic silica, percentage organic matter, percentage carbon, and percentage nitrogen. Both sediment chlorophyll a and a diatom-based trophic index (TI) were significantly and positively correlated with riverine or local nutrient indices. Two diatom species, Amphora copulata Giffen and Navicula yarrensis Grunow, were significantly and negatively correlated with riverine and local nutrient indices. These results suggest that these variables can be used as potential indicators of trophic status. Results from a complete-linkage cluster analysis on the diatom assemblage data demonstrated that the sediment cores could be split into three time periods: early 1900s (pre-1930s/1940s), mid-1900s (1930s/40s to 1960s/1970s), and late 1900s (1960snos to 1990s). Examination of the sediment chlorophyll a and TI data over these time periods, coupled with an analysis of variance of nutrient inputs between the time periods, suggests that nutrient loading increased dramatically from the mid1960s to the mid-1970s. This study demonstrates that (1) a retrospective analysis of sediment cores can be conducted in highly variable salt marsh ponds and (2) these salt marsh environments are already affected by the higher nutrient loads from both riverine and local processes occurring over the last 50 years. Additional nutrient loading, e.g., from river diversion projects for the lower Mississippi River, may exacerbate eutrophication already evident in the marsh environment.","10.4319/lo.2006.51.1_part_2.0534","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329590","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32944467160&doi=10.4319%2flo.2006.51.1_part_2.0534&partnerID=40&md5=e3c8ead5569af5c60a92f08db459d2b3"

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329593","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f"

Plant community composition was quantified in three zones (marsh-dune border, central marsh, and marsh-cultivated land border) identified across the gradient. The results suggest that the distribution and variation in abundance ""performance"" of plant species is mainly ruled by salinity and soil texture gradients (from sandy to silt-clay). Texture seemed to affect vegetation zonation in the marshes near sand dunes, since at the marsh-dune border the percentage of wind-blown sand increases. Variations in field capacity, total organic carbon, pH, and calcium carbonate did not appear to control the performance of plant species. Indications on the performance of six species are provided. Limbarda crithmoides increased with the amount of sand and was often located at the marsh-dune border. Elymus repens and Phragmites australis increased with decreasing salinity and were frequently found at marsh borders, however E. repens also increased with the amount of silt-clay. Sarcocornia fruticosa increased with salinity and silt-clay, while Halimione portulacoides increased with salinity and seemed less subject to changes in soil texture. Elymus pycnanthus increased with salinity and decreased with the amount of silt-clay, however, the ordination suggested that other factors may be determinant for this species.

Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions.

Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15% for mangrove and 55% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65% for mangrove and 60% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95% for mangrove and 345% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

However, little is known about the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC concentrations and fractions in tidal marshes dominated by native C-4 plants. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0-4 years (SA-4), 4-8 years (SA-8), and 8-12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10-50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C-4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities.","10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60396-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329610","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032683614&doi=10.1016%2fS1002-0160%2817%2960396-5&partnerID=40&md5=9b092f935a0e93a2a202c2217c4d9621"

At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term 'refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.","10.1371/journal.pone.0069244","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329612","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879983342&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0069244&partnerID=40&md5=fb2f0fb9a1b05349d291728ecad70fba"

S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary.

In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS C-14 chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat. We strongly recommend strategies for minimizing marsh loss.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab7a56","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329615","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086596445&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fab7a56&partnerID=40&md5=24b3a12d944d6b90aab2c46452524737"

The extent of contamination by individual metal species was dependent upon the nature of the site-specific inputs. The enrichment of industrially derived metals, such as Hg and Cd, for example, occurred at sites adjacent to urban areas; Two Tree Island (situated on the outer Thames Estuary) and to a lesser extent South Woodham Ferrers (situated on the River Crouch). Lead concentrations were elevated at all five sites inferring that a significant input was derived from a common generic source, such as atmospheric deposition.

Permanent plots established in a high marsh near Waties Island in northeast South Carolina were measured for plant coverage from 2002-2010. At the beginning and at the end of the study, four groups of plots were identified: mixed indicated by Borrichia frutescens, Distichlis spicata, and Fimbristylis castanea; Juncus indicated by Juncus roemerianus; Salicornia indicated by Salicornia virginica; and Spartina indicated by Spartina patens. Ordination of the 2010 plot data and soil analyses produced clear separation of the groups along a single dominant axis with Salicornia and Juncus groups at the high end of a salinity gradient and the Spartina group at the high end of soil organic matter gradient. Comparison of plots classified in 2002 to the same plots in 2010 suggested both stability and change, depending on community classification. Salicornia and Spartina groups were stable. The mixed group experienced a switch in dominance from Distichlis spicata to Borrichia frutescens, whereas the Juncus group had gradually declining importance of Juncus roemerianus and gradually increasing importance of Borrichia frutescens.

The goal of this study was to provide insight into carbon burial variability of a single tidal salt marsh. Six marsh sediment cores were collected along a tidal creek in the Big Bend of Florida from the mouth to the coastal forest within the marsh levee and plain. Each was analyzed for porosity, % OM, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C-13, N-15, and excess Pb-210 to determine vertical accretion and CBRs. Porosity, % OM, and TOC and TN were found to be highest in the low marsh and within the marsh levee. Stable isotopes of OM indicate the source is dominated by C3 plant species in both the levee and plain. Average vertical accretion ranges from 0.9 mm yr(-1) to 2.2 mm yr(-1) with the slowest rates in the low marsh. Average carbon burial ranges from 49.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1) to 109.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). High carbon burial associated with low sediment accumulation in the Low Marsh and low carbon burial associated with high sediment accumulation rates in the High Marsh are typical in this marsh. These variations imply that the highest carbon burial occurs in the zone most vulnerable to loss via inundation and erosion.","10.1002/lno.10652","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329622","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030120881&doi=10.1002%2flno.10652&partnerID=40&md5=410199aecf76aa129f3a1950e263a158"

T.","2014","On autochthonous organic production and its implication for the consolidation of temperate salt marshes","The organic production related to minerogene salt marsh deposits represents a challenge to all attempts to model the development of these areas, and evaluate their chances of survival under different sea level scenarios. Salt marsh deposits on a typical temperate backbarrier saltmarsh area at the Skallingen barrierspit (Denmark) were investigated for autochthonous or below ground organic production, which was found to have a mean value of 0.14 kg m(-2) y(-1) or about 0.1 mm y(-1). This production is concentrated in the upper approximately 5 cm of the salt marsh. Below this level the organic material decomposes with a decreasing organic content until about 15 cm below the surface. Hereunder the decomposition of organic material seems to stabilize at a very low level. The constant rate of the below ground organic production results in a larger concentration of this type of organic matter in the slowest accreting salt marsh deposits. The root activity is the primary reason for differences in the bulk dry density of salt marsh surface layers, therefore the surface layers of slowly accreting salt marshes have the lowest bulk dry density. During autocompaction, the bulk dry density increases down core. This process is only to a small degree (<10%) directly affected by the space loss due to decomposition of organic matter. The decay of organic matter, however, is most likely indirectly part of the autocompaction process by weakening the internal strength of the root fabric and thus the capability of resistance against compaction from the overburden of depositing sediments.

Here, we evaluate the contribution of mud-associated OM in salt and brackish marshes in Louisiana. Based on 14 soil cores, the OM content of the mud fraction-i.e., any material smaller than 64 mu m-was 17% +/- 7% for the salt marshes and 28% +/- 14% for the brackish marshes. This remains nearly uniform over the top 35 cm depth, suggesting that this material is deposited contemporaneously with the mud. The dry bulk density of the mud (300-450 kg m(-3)) is also much lower than what was estimated using a previously proposed two-constituent mixing model (1990 kg m(-3)). To reconcile this discrepancy, we developed a modified mixing model that includes mud OM and differentiates sand as a separate constituent with its high dry bulk density. The model estimates that mud contributes to similar to 60% of the total marsh vertical accretion in Louisiana, considerably higher than the similar to 14% estimated with the two-constituent mixing model. The result, which is a direct consequence of the relatively high porosity of mud, highlights that mud deposition is crucial for the accretion of microtidal marshes. Further, the model estimates that the mud OM constitutes similar to 60% of the total soil OM, emphasizing that in situ plant production is not the only-and, in minerogenic marshes, not the major-contributor to OM accumulation.","10.1002/lno.11475","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329625","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086259764&doi=10.1002%2flno.11475&partnerID=40&md5=d2299ab9495a06785020cf797d863924"

In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates.

Therefore, they constitute key factors affecting the iron biogeochemical processes in these environments. The aim of this work is to evaluate the physicochemical and mineralogical variations associated to iron biogeochemistry in palaeo and actual salt marshes in the area of influence of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Pampean Plain, Argentina. In soils of exhumed palaeo marshes, the iron contents are 56-95 mu mol g(-1), whereas these contents decrease to 36-75 mu mol g(-1) in actual marsh soils. The presence of framboidal and poliframboidal pyrites associated with gypsum, barite, calcite, halite and iron oxyhydroxides defines the conditions of the pedosedimentary sequences of the Holocene paleomarshes. Sequences of pyrite formation (sulfidization) and degradation (sulfuricization) were observed. These processes were evidenced by a sequential extraction, reflecting that the largest proportion of iron is in the form of crystalline iron oxides (28-76 %) and lepidocrocite (6-16 %); while the proportion associated with ferrihydrite and pyrite is low (0-9 and 1-17 %, respectively). These facts could be partly explained by the complex redox processes characteristic of these environments, such as aeration generated by the rhizosphere and intense bioturbation by invertebrates. These iron biomineralizations have been useful because they allow paleoenvironmental interpretations and characterization of paleomarshes, and environmental inferences related to the management of actual salt marshes.","10.1007/s12665-016-5506-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329637","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963680091&doi=10.1007%2fs12665-016-5506-8&partnerID=40&md5=96143b819f8109ced8a0bc204e455eef"

However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Development of aboveground biomass and MOM was dependent on elevation and frequency of tidal inundation. Aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora , which occupied low elevations along tidal creeks and was inundated frequently, developed to levels similar to the natural marsh (750 to 1,300 g/m(2) ) within three years after creation. Spartina cynosuroides , which dominated interior areas of the marsh and was flooded less frequently, required 9 years to consistently achieve aboveground biomass equivalent to the natural marsh (600 to 1,560 g/m(2) ). Aboveground biomass of Spartina patens , which was planted at the highest elevations along the terrestrial margin and seldom flooded, never consistently developed aboveground biomass comparable with the natural marsh during the 15 years after marsh creation. MOM (0 to 10 cm) generally developed at the same rate as aboveground biomass. Between 1988 and 1998, soil bulk density decreased and porosity and organic C and N pools increased in the created marsh. Like vegetation, wetland soil development proceeded faster in response to increased inundation, especially in the streamside zone dominated by S. alterniflora. We estimated that in the streamside and interior zones, an additional 30 years (nitrogen) to 90 years (organic C, porosity) are needed for the upper 30 cm of created marsh soil to become equivalent to the natural marsh. Wetland soil characteristics of the S. patens community along upland fringe will take longer to develop, more than 200 years. Development of the benthic invertebrate-based food web, which depends on organic matter enrichment of the upper 5 to 10 cm of soil, is expected to take less time. Wetland soil characteristics and functions of created irregularly flooded brackish marshes require longer to develop compared with regularly flooded salt marshes because reduced tidal inundation slows wetland vegetation and soil development. The hydrologic regime (regularly vs. irregularly flooded) of the ""target"" wetland should be considered when setting realistic expectations for success criteria of created and restored wetlands.","10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.01020.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329650","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036087556&doi=10.1046%2fj.1526-100X.2002.01020.x&partnerID=40&md5=3a38d4e3004b2f985425a40faa65d1ec"

Results showed that the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora altered the stocks and distribution of inorganic sulfur form in marsh soils. Compared with BF, the contents of H2O-S, Adsorbed-S and HCl-Volatile-S in soils of SA increased by 52.6%, 78.2% and 21.0%, respectively, while that of HCl-Soluble-S decreased by 3.4%. In contrast, the levels of H2O S, Adsorbed-S and HCl-Soluble-S in soils of SA' increased by 43.9%, 70.6% and 29.6%, respectively, whereas that of HCl-Volatile-S decreased by 11.6%. The contents of total inorganic sulfur ( TIS) in soils of SA and SA' increased by 40.7% and 37.8%, while the stocks of TIS increased by 26.8% and 31.4%, respectively. The key factors affecting different forms of inorganic sulfur in marsh soils had changed due to the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora. In particular, the key factors affecting the variations of H2O-S contents changed from soil grain composition and bulk density in BF to soil organic matter in SA' and SA. The seaward invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased the content of TIS in marsh soils, which was mainly contributed by H2O-S and Adsorbed-S. Thus, it was concluded that the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased the supply capacity of available sulfur in marsh soils, which, to some extent, accelerated its seaward invasion.","10.13287/j.1001-9332.201910.004","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329652","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073472562&doi=10.13287%2fj.1001-9332.201910.004&partnerID=40&md5=4897f6c78d4aa2e9256cdfe079e357da"

Here, a study is conducted in the mudflat, open shrubland, and dense shrubland in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, and soil organic C (OC) stock, particulate organic matter C (POMC), and aggregate-associated OC in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths are investigated along these vegetation zones. Among the three vegetation zones, dense shrubland had the greatest soil OC stock, open shrubland had the lowest value, and mudflat had an intermediate value. In each soil depth, dense shrubland generally had higher soil OC and POMC concentrations, and POMC/OC ratio compared to mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. Moreover, dense shrubland had a greater proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) and OC content in the macro-aggregates than mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. In addition, the OC content in the soil macro-aggregates positively correlated with soil POMC concentration. These results suggest that the high spatial variability in soil OC quantity and quality along the vegetation zones should be incorporated to accurately develop regional C budget in coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, and also imply that a shift in vegetation zones induced by sea level rise could potentially cause substantial changes in the quantity and quality of soil OC in the tidal salt marshes.","10.1002/clen.201800049","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329658","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045133852&doi=10.1002%2fclen.201800049&partnerID=40&md5=c6c924e8f41c53acb5675879c74514ef"

Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the western most fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br-) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8-75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3-13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8-13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1-8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br- rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111-253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br-] of interstitial waters (129 mu g/L-79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1-508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14-173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic ""model"". As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br- upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.","10.1007/s12237-018-00509-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329662","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062156523&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-00509-7&partnerID=40&md5=bee9157c89805f2ee696b3f96de53fff"

After 20 yr, the younger salt marsh had the same plant species richness and high species similarity as a 35 yr old salt marsh (17 and 16, respectively, similarity index = 0.9), but both sites had lower species richness and similarity than a nearby natural salt marsh (36 plant species and similarity indices of 0.45 with the 35 yr old marsh and 0.46 with the 20 yr old marsh). Plant species present in the two recovering salt marshes followed a similar distribution pattern in relation to organic matter, conductivity and moisture content although this zonation differed from the natural salt marsh. The range of edaphic factors measured was also similar, but differed from those in the natural salt marsh. The process of plant species recolonization and spatial distribution might be delayed by a low probability of species arrival and by the time need for the restoration of hydrologic and edaphic factors.

Radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137), stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15), organic matter concentrations and nutrient concentrations were measured. Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1). The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites (mostly >= 1% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5% N), decreased to approximately 0.6% N by 1940, and then remained constant to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3 plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level. Surface sediments in all of the cores have more total phosphorus (TP) than below ground. The downstream site closest to the estuary had an abrupt increase in surface TP (i.e., 0-10 cm). Sediment TP increased slightly from 2003 to present time (i.e., from 0.07 to 0.11% P). Sediment accumulation and accretion rates in the Murderkill River marshes are similar to the accretion rates determined by previous studies in the region.","10.1635/053.167.0107","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329669",NA

Sediment cores (ca. 60 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in As content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominated). Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores.

Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock. These findings thereby yield important implications for carbon crediting and land-use management.","10.3354/meps13009","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329683","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067861084&doi=10.3354%2fmeps13009&partnerID=40&md5=bc62d06f19bfb0a7c2f3f0f0c2140fe2"

During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the goal is to identify the soil properties in restored marsh that could be modified to enhance back-barrier marsh habitat.Laboratory analyses of 60 cores from four different vegetation density classes in restored marsh and nine cores from natural marshes included bulk density, soil moisture content, grain size, sorting, pH, conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Vegetation density in restored marshes had no significant effect on soil properties, with the exception of bulk density. Marsh type had a significant effect on all measured soil properties.

Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.","10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107240","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329691","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101168187&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107240&partnerID=40&md5=9fca23eaef2474ce3ac52c3d7c137c6d"

This study determined denitrification rates across a typical northern Gulf of Mexico salt marsh landscape that included a natural marsh, a tidal creek, and a 21-year-old restored salt marsh. Denitrification capacity, measured with the isotope pairing technique on a membrane inlet mass spectrometer, was comparable across the sites despite significant differences in above and below ground characteristics. Total extractable ammonium concentrations and sediment carbon content were higher at the natural marsh compared to the restored marsh. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were highest at the creek compared to the vegetated sites and lowest at the restored marsh. This suggests that marsh restoration projects reestablish nitrogen removal capacity at rates similar to those in natural systems and can help to significantly reduce nitrogen loads to the coastal ocean.","10.1007/s00267-018-1057-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329700","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046546699&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-018-1057-y&partnerID=40&md5=e80d3f91f29aef8a28f8e186aa7ec04e"

The majority of studies on coastal land loss use aerial and satellite photographic analysis while field and site-specific measurements are limited. The aim of this study was to spatially and temporally measure coastal marsh edge erosion and investigate factors responsible for differences in erosion including shoreline orientation, soil physio-chemical properties, and wind speed and duration. A total of 33 transects across six island sites in northern Barataria Basin, Louisiana were established. Transects on shorelines facing different compass directions were measured for erosion for up to 2 years. Soils were analyzed for physiochemical properties including bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Bathymetric surveys were conducted to determine the extent of the erosive bay bottom profile. In addition, C-14 dating of the basal organic matter (1.5-1.6 m) was conducted. Erosion rates ranged from 49.27 to 324.85 cm y(-1) with a mean value of 141.69 +/- 22.45 cm y(-1). As expected, erosion rates were significantly different (p < 0.001) between protected and unprotected sites. The erosion rate was not correlated with wind speed (r = -0.07), weakly correlated with compass direction of shoreline (r = 0.25) and water level (r = 0.25) but strongly correlated with duration of wind (r = 0.60). Erosion rate was negatively correlated (r = -0.45) with bulk density and positively correlated with organic matter content (r = 0.42) of the top 40 cm of the soil. Over time, the marsh is eroded down to a depth of 1.5 m, which correlates to annual loss of 1.82 +/- 0.29 m(3) volume of marsh per meter shoreline length including a loss of organic matter (141.5 +/- 22.55 kg m(-1)) and carbon (63.32 +/- 10.09 kg m(-1)) previously preserved for up to 850 years. As a consequence, annual CO2 emissions for Barataria Basin were estimated to be 1.56 +/- 0.26 million tCO(2)e y(-1). Results can inform coastal managers as to the most vulnerable marshes to target restoration efforts. Due to high relative sea level rise in coastal Louisiana, these results can also be used to inform the world's stable coastlines on the relative vulnerability of their coastal marshes in the near future, due to projected eustatic sea level. Consequently, the eroding coastlines across the globe may be a significant source of CO2 emissions in near future, as millennial age stored soil carbon is released in a relatively short time, potentially overwhelming human efforts to slow rising atmospheric CO2 levels.","10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106289","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329703","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066864020&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2019.106289&partnerID=40&md5=b8d5a97c05db21bb6988962830da2a00"

Focusing on the arthropod community in the dominant salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora, we tested two hypotheses: first, that marsh community structure varies geographically, and second, that two aspects of marsh function (response to eutrophication and addition of dead plant material) also vary geographically. We worked at eleven sites on the Gulf Coast and eleven sites on the Atlantic Coast, dividing each coast up into two geographic areas. Abiotic conditions (tidal range, soil organic content, and water content, but not soil salinity), plant variables (Spartina nitrogen content, height, cover of dead plant material, but not live Spartina percent cover or light interception), and arthropod variables (proportional abundances of predators, sucking herbivores, stem-boring herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, but not total arthropod numbers) varied among the four geographic regions. Latitude and mean tidal range explained much of this geographic variation. Nutrient enrichment increased all arthropod functional groups in the community, consistent with previous experimental results, and had similar effects in all geographic regions, contrary to our hypothesis, suggesting widespread consistency in this aspect of ecosystem function. The addition of dead plant material had surprisingly little effect on the arthropod community. Our results caution against the uncritical extrapolation of work done in one geographic region to another, but indicate that some aspects of marsh function may operate in similar ways in different geographic regions, despite spatial variation in community structure.","10.1007/s00442-012-2352-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329722","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867564461&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-012-2352-6&partnerID=40&md5=a9c5f42e657cd0caa60fbbc3da7b15b6"
"JOUR",14329723,"Abbott, Katherine M; Quirk, Tracy; Fultz, Lisa M","1800","Soil microbial community development across a 32-year coastal wetland restoration time series and the relative importance of environmental factors","Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystem functioning through processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling, and regulating vegetation structure and productivity. Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153359","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329723",NA

The Eddy-covariance method (indirect method) was used to estimate marsh canopy net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and measured an annual gross primary production of 979 g C m(-2), while the loss through respiration was 766g Cm-2, resulting in a net uptake of 213 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Time of the day, solar irradiation, air temperature, humidity and wind direction all together explained 66% of the variation in NEE. The high marsh community of Spartina patens showed NEE to be significantly higher than the low marsh community. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over long time scales was estimated by measuring the actual amount of total organic carbon contained in dated sediment cores from a natural marsh (direct method), which resulted in a carbon accumulation rate of 192.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Changes in total organic carbon content over time in the core sample showed that 78% of organic carbon remained stored in the sediments after 130 years and only the most recalcitrant carbon (50%) remained under storage beyond 645 years. Overall the study showed that temperate macrotidal salt marshes are net sinks of carbon with potential for long term carbon storage. The marsh turned into a carbon sink at the beginning of May and switched back to being a source in late November. The average sedimentation rate estimated from the 137 CS dating (1950s to present) was 1.4 mm yr(-1) which is similar to accretion rates of comparable S. patens patches in the east coast. Accretion rates derived from our study are slightly lower than the 60+ year rate of sea level rise (2.6 mm yr(-1)) recorded by tide gauge measurements in the Northeast. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

M.","2018","Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf","Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329761","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933"
"JOUR",14329767,"Chen, Yaping; Chen, Guangcheng; Ye, Yong","2015","Coastal vegetation invasion increases greenhouse gas emission from wetland soils but also increases soil carbon accumulation","Soil properties and soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from four coastal wetlands were studied throughout the year, namely, native Kandelia obovata mangrove forest vs. exotic Sonneratia apetala mangrove forest, and native Cyperus malaccensis salt marsh vs. exotic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Soils of the four wetlands were all net sources of greenhouse gases while Sonneratia forest contributed the most with a total soil-atmosphere CO2-equivalent flux of 137.27 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), which is 69.23%, 99.75% and 44.56% higher than that of Kandelia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively. The high underground biomass and distinctive root structure of Sonneratia might be responsible for its high greenhouse gas emission from the soil. Soils in Spartina marsh emitted the second largest amount of total greenhouse gases but it ranked first in emitting trace greenhouse gases. Annual average CH4 and N2O fluxes from Spartina soil were 13.77 and 1.14 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which are 2.08 and 1.46 times that of Kandelia, 1.03 and 1.15 times of Sonneratia, and 1.74 and 1.02 times of Cyperus, respectively. Spartina has longer growing season and higher productivity than native marshes which might increase greenhouse gas emission in cold seasons. Exotic wetland soils had higher carbon stock as compared to their respective native counterparts but their carbon stocks were offset by a larger proportion because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions. Annual total soil-atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases reduced soil carbon burial benefits by 8.1%, 9.5%, 6.4% and 7.2% for Kandelia, Sonneratia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively, which narrowed down the gaps in net soil carbon stock between native and exotic wetlands. The results indicated that the invasion of exotic wetland plants might convert local coastal soils into a considerable atmospheric source of greenhouse gases although they at the same time increase soil carbon accumulation.

However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.","10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329768","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b"

Within this framework, the effects of environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43% of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs. The strong relationships observed between pollutant concentrations and some of the microbial indicators indicated the potential for using microbial community analyses in assessments of the ecosystem health of salt marshes.","10.1128/AEM.72.5.3357-3366.2006","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329770","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646544692&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.72.5.3357-3366.2006&partnerID=40&md5=1c7c34ee50d1087d3a153cae559372e0"

However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh.

Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization.

However, there is a lack of direct measurements of fluxes occurring between the marsh surface and the water column to corroborate this hypothesis. This study compared fluxes of nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) between the water column and the marsh surface and the emission of greenhouse gases, at four sites located along the salinity gradient of an estuary of north-western Wales (UK). The exchanges of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DON), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus and silicic acid, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were measured during tidal inundation in May and September 2008 using in situ incubation chambers. There was no linear pattern along the salinity gradient and the concentration of nutrients and DOC in the flood water did not appear to control the biogeochemical processes driving the marsh surface/water column exchanges in the studied marshes. Multivariate analysis showed a clear discrimination in functioning between sites with the fresh and brackish marshes having a more similar functioning compared to low and middle marshes. The main differences between these two groupings were in the fluxes of DOC and nitrate. The phenology of plant species, soil organic matter content and soil oxygenation appear be the dominant factors explaining the observed fluxes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To comprehensively evaluate the ecological effects of livestock grazing and tidal flooding on salt marshes, we conducted a grazing-exclusion experiment in the high and middle marsh zones of the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Livestock grazing generally enhanced EMF in the salt marshes, with a stronger impact in the middle marshes than in the high ones. Although plant biomass, above-ground N of plants, soil organic C and sediment deposition rate decreased under grazing, activities of soil microbes and nematodes, soil N pool, N mineralization, decomposition and soil respiration increased. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that tidal flooding and associated replenishment of sediments may mitigate the negative effects of grazing on plants and sedimentation and strengthen positive grazing impacts on nutrient cycling, consequently reinforcing the beneficial effects of livestock grazing on the salt marsh ecosystem multifunctionality. Our results provide a holistic framework of ecosystem-level responses to livestock grazing in salt marshes and highlight the regulatory role of external environmental factors such as tidal flooding. Although livestock grazing enhanced the overall EMF (represents the nutrient cycling rate) of salt marshes in our study, it was not necessarily desirable for ecosystem services.

Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

Analyses of the relationships between plant communities and environmental conditions in salt marshes are expected to provide useful information for the prediction of changes during climate change. In this study, relationships between the current vegetation structure and environmental factors were evaluated in the tidal flat at the southern tip of Ganghwa, Korea, where salt marshes are well-developed. Results The vegetation structure in Ganghwa salt marshes was divided into three groups by cluster analysis: group A, dominated by Phragmites communis; group B, dominated by Suaeda japonica; and group C, dominated by other taxa. As determined by PERMANOVA, the groups showed significant differences with respect to altitude, soil moisture, soil organic matter, salinity, sand, clay, and silt ratios. A canonical correspondence analysis based on the percent cover of each species in the quadrats showed that the proportion of sand increased as the altitude increased and S. japonica appeared in soil with a relatively high silt proportion, while P. communis was distributed in soil with low salinity. Conclusions The distributions of three halophyte groups differed depending on the altitude, soil moisture, salinity, and soil organic matter, sand, silt, and clay contents. Pioneer species, such as S. japonica, appeared in soil with a relatively high silt content. The P. communis community survived under a wider range of soil textures than previously reported in the literature; the species was distributed in soils with relatively low salinity, with a range expansion toward the sea in areas with freshwater influx. The observed spatial distribution patterns may provide a basis for conservation under declining salt marshes.","10.1186/s41610-021-00202-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329802","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120752436&doi=10.1186%2fs41610-021-00202-0&partnerID=40&md5=dec83e36635a893e97a1d27d2b29b1ee"

Our results indicated that the organic matter preserved in the sediments was highly affected by the marsh plants that dominated the sampling sites. delta(13)C values of organic matter preserved in the upper fresh water site sediment were more negative (-23.0+/-0.3) as affected by the C-3 plants than the values of organic matter preserved in the sediments of middle (-18.9+/-0.8) and mud flat sites (-19.4+/-0.1) as influenced mainly by the C4 marsh plants. The distribution of n-alkanes measured in all sediments showed similar patterns as those determined in the marsh grasses S. alterniflora and T. latifolia, and nC(21) to nC(33) long-chain n-alkanes were the major compounds determined in all sediment samples. The strong odd-to-even carbon numbered n-alkane predominance was found in all three sediments and nC(29) was the most abundant homologue in all samples measured. Both delta(13)C compositions of organic matter and n-alkane distributions in these sediments indicate that the marsh plants could contribute significant amount of organic matter preserved in Plum Island salt marsh sediments.

We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329816","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9"

A total of 25 surface sediment samples were analyzed from two transects across a 0.5-km(2) salt marsh island; one transect traverses relatively old marsh and the other a mix of old and new marsh. We use elevation and distance to creek head as geomorphic proxies and associate them with the abundance (carbon, nitrogen) and the isotopic/molecular composition of organic constituents (i.e., lignin). Statistically significant linear correlations were observed between elevation and distance from the creek head with OM content, suggesting a likely geomorphic influence. However, the trend was positive for the older marsh and negative for the new marsh. Hence, sediment sampling at or near levees can give rise to a factor of 5-8 difference in OM content. Also, opposing trends were observed in OM provenance with old marsh having greater contributions of marine algae or allochthonous OM and new marsh having a predominantly autochthonous OM signature. Further, these data reveal two scales of variability in OM content and composition, one at similar to 10(1) m and the other at similar to 10(3) m. We ascribe the 10(1)-m scale variability to the effect of salt marsh geomorphic structure, while the 10(3)-m scale variability is likely related to the differences in local nutrient input and OM preservation and due to sediment source and accumulation rates and processes between sites.","10.1007/s12237-015-9957-z","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329817","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952983898&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-015-9957-z&partnerID=40&md5=05531a6c683b13dfde80b7eced6d1139"

Freshwater inputs have been proved to be an effective restoration way for degraded coastal wetlands. However, little information is available on the changes in soil quality caused by freshwater inputs. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in freshwater restoration wetlands (FRW), tidal salt marshes with Suaeda salsa (SSM) and tidal salt marshes with Tamarix chinensis (TSM) in the Yellow River Delta, China, in August 2015, to investigate the changes in soil quality after freshwater inputs.

Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.","10.1007/s13157-021-01528-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329826","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122921800&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-021-01528-0&partnerID=40&md5=5177269d35eb348e8e758c2290d7f0bb"

Widespread invasive species, particularly invasive ecosystem engineers with large effects on their environment, may alter these gradients. We sampled 3-5 stands of the invasive common reed, Phragmites australis, in eight coastal wetlands ranging from Massachusetts (42 degrees N) to South Carolina (32 degrees N) to document geographic variation in P. australis primary production, associated plant and animal species diversity, and sediment carbon storage and to examine how local-, regional-, and large-scale environmental factors contribute to these patterns. Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables. The percent of developed land was positively associated with P. australis density, yet this variable had relatively low predictive power in our study.

Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion.

Pitfall traps were installed in a gradient from 20 to 150 cm above MHT (mean high tide: 157 cm + NN, NN: 500 cm above 0 at Amsterdam gauge) at the North Sea coast or NN at the Baltic Sea coast at six or seven sampling elevations, each with five replicates. Conductivity, water content, organic substance, frequency or duration of floodings, sand content and pH of the soil were determined. The flooding regime is the major factor controlling the zonation of invertebrates. Two and three invertebrate assemblages at the North and Baltic Sea, respectively, were distinguished. These corresponded well with the vegetational zones. The border between the two zones was at 60-80 cm above MHT at the North Sea. The three zones at the Baltic Sea extended between 20 and 30 cm, 40 to 80 cm and 100 to 150 cm above NN. The elevation of the mean abundance of species above MHT or NN was calculated. A tide simulation experiment resulted in a shifting population and in an increasing activity under a tidal regime as predicted for the global climate change conditions in 2050. From the actual elevation of the mean abundance, the habitat size of salt marsh species was calculated for a moderate and worse scenario of global climate change. Habitat reduction becomes highest for species of the lower salt marsh zone. Under worse conditions the gradiental length of habitat will only amount to a maximum of 20 m at the slopes of the dikes.","10.1023/A:1016018021533","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329854",NA

A.","2020","Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance in a North Carolina, USA, Salt Marsh","Salt marshes have among the highest carbon (C) burial rates of any ecosystem and often rely on C accumulation to gain elevation and persist in locations with accelerating sea level rise. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), the accumulation or loss of C resulting from vertical CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes, lateral C fluxes, and sediment C inputs, varies across salt marshes; thus, extrapolation of NECB to an entire marsh is challenging. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to salt marshes impact NECB by influencing each component of NECB, but differences in the impacts of fertilization between edge and interior marsh must be considered when scaling up. NECB was estimated for the 0.5 km(2) Spartina alterniflora marsh area of Freeman Creek, NC, under control and fertilized conditions at both interior and edge berm sites. Annual CO2 fluxes were nearly balanced at control sites, but fertilization significantly increased net CO2 emissions at edge sites. Lateral C export, modeled using respiration rates, represented a significant C loss that increased with fertilization in both edge and interior marsh. Sediment C input was a significant C source in the interior, nearly doubling with fertilization, but represented a small source on the edge. When extrapolating C exchanges to the entire marsh, including edge which comprised 17% of the marsh area, the marsh displayed net loss of C despite a net C gain in the interior. Fertilization increased net C loss fivefold. Extrapolation of NECB to whole marshes requires inclusion of C fluxes for both edge and interior marsh.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh ecosystems rely on carbon accumulation to increase elevation and survive sea level rise. The amount of carbon accumulated in a marsh is the net result of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, fixation of carbon by photosynthesis, export of dissolved carbon to the creek, and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments deposited on the surface. Because each component varies between edge and interior marsh, it is challenging to estimate carbon accumulation for a whole marsh system. It is not currently known how increasing nitrogen pollution impacts carbon accumulation for a whole marsh. To find out, we compared measurements of carbon accumulation in fertilized and unfertilized plots in the edge and interior of a salt marsh at Freeman Creek, North Carolina, USA. Overall, the marsh gained carbon in the interior but lost carbon on the edge, leading to a loss of about 50,000 kg C year(-1) across the 0.5 km(2) marsh area. However, under fertilized conditions, Freeman Creek marsh carbon loss increased nearly fivefold overall as a result of the large increase in carbon loss from the edge marsh. This study shows that increasing nitrogen pollution in coastal waters will cause increasing net carbon loss in marshes.","10.1029/2019JG005509","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329857",NA

However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

Several hypothesized drivers of recent dieback events have been proposed, however, some aspects of salt marsh soil composition and dieback recurrence remain unexplored. We surveyed soil conditions in dieback affected zones and unaffected zones in two marshes on Sapelo Island, Georgia during a drought year to test whether dieback is associated with spatial variations in soil properties such as pH, salinity, water retention and texture. We also surveyed previously documented dieback locations to test whether dieback zones exhibit spatial recurrence. Tidal salt marshes showed significant spatial variability in three physical soil characteristics and exhibited strong associations with zones of S. alterniflora dieback. Sediments in dieback zones had lower silt content, higher bulk density and lower field capacity (a measure of water retention) relative to healthy S. alterniflora stands. Dieback zones also showed patterns of spatial recurrence and similarities with vegetation free areas. These data suggest that the legacy of dieback may be reflected in soils making certain areas susceptible to further dieback during drought periods.","10.1007/s13157-014-0588-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329862",NA

A total of 71,833 specimens representing 38 species were identified from a gradient of different elevation zones across the study area. We identified five live assemblages and nine biofacies for the dead assemblages from estuarine, low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, and upland transition environments. Although dissolution of calcareous tests was observed in the dead assemblages, characteristic species and abundance patterns dependent on elevation in the intertidal zone were similar between living assemblages and dead biofacies. The assemblages from the eastern Mississippi Sound estuaries were dominated by Ammonia tepida, Cribroelphidium poeyanum, C. excavatum, and Paratrochammina simplissima. The low marshes were dominated by Ammotium salsum, Ammobaculites exiguus, and Miliammina fusca. The dominant species in the middle marshes was Arenoparrella mexicana. The most abundant species in the high marshes was Entzia macrescens. The upland-marsh transition zones were dominated by Trochamminita irregularis and Pseudothurammina limnetis. Canonical correspondence analysis was applied to assess the relationship between a priori defined biofacies and measured environmental data (elevation, grain size, organic matter, and salinity) to test the hypothesis that distribution of foraminiferal assemblages is driven by elevation and hence flooding frequency. Salinity was the second most important explanatory variable of dead assemblages. Riverine freshwater from the Pascagoula River markedly influenced the live and dead assemblages in the Pascagoula River marsh, which was represented by low diversity and densities and dominance by Ammoastuta inepta. The relationship between the measured environmental variables and assemblage distributions can be used in future Mississippi Sound paleo-environmental studies.","10.2113/gsjfr.49.1.29","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329869","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061596680&doi=10.2113%2fgsjfr.49.1.29&partnerID=40&md5=757a7aef8e1627e59b8343dcbba331b7"

The results indicated that the total SOC content at Area A (southeast of Dongtan, sandy soil with Phragmites communis) was only 46.11% of that of Area B (northeast of Dongtan, clay soil with mixed P. communis and Spartina alterniflora)(P= 0.000 < 0.05), but their organic matter input per year was almost identical. These findings implied that Area B had a lower output of SOC. The microbial biomass at Area A was 3.83 times greater than that at Area B (P= 0.049 < 0.05); the soil catalase and invertase activities at Area A, which were related to carbon metabolism, were 60.31% (P=0.006 < 0.05) and 34.33% (P=0.021 < 0.05) higher than at Area B, respectively; and the soil respiration at Area A was also higher than at Area B. These findings implied that the microbial activities at Area A were greater than those at Area B, and therefore the carbon metabolism was rapid, resulting in increased SOC output at Area A. Increased water content and salinity in the clay soil at Area B may inhibit the microbial activities, thereby reducing the decomposition of the organic matter and enhancing carbon sequestration. In addition, some artificial measures for controlling spread of S. alterniflora at Area B (mowing/digging and tillage (M + D); mowing/digging and tillage/waterlogging (M + D + W)) were found to generally improve the microbial activity of soil, thereby increasing SOC output. However, when the two different physical controlling modes were compared, the SOC and microbial activities of the soil subjected to the M + D + W treatment were relatively high and low, respectively, due to waterlogging restraining the microbial metabolism. These findings indicated that the difference in microbial activities was the important factor leading to variability in the SOC sequestration capability between Areas A and B. Additionally, with the exception of soil texture and vegetation types, environmental conditions and artificial turbulence also influenced microbial activities of soil, and hence SOC output and organic carbon sequestration capability.

Quantitative variations of meiofauna were analyzed monthly and, during some phases of the year cycle, at two or three-days intervals. The reasons for the recorded faunal variations were searched by principal component analysis among the main physico-chemical factors of the environment and more especially those related to the particulate organic matter of sediments. Over the concerned period, it seemed difficult to point out the subtle effects of biodeposition on meiofauna as the seasonal factor, basically thermal, was found responsible for the largest quantitative variations observed in the communities. Nematodes and harpacticoid copepods inversely reacted to the massive input of biodeposits.

This increase has led to significant loss of plant cover in all major salt- and freshwater coastal habitats between 1976 and 1997. A series of transects established in 1976 was resurveyed in 1997. Exposed sediment, extent and type of vegetative cover, and aquatic areas were recorded along transects using a classification of 12 a priori classes. Five regions within the colony were identified, and changes in vegetation cover differed among these and depended on unique combinations of vegetation class and year. Grubbing by geese has led to loss of graminoid plants, especially in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Exposed sediments have largely replaced previously vegetated areas since 1976. Species characteristic of disturbed sites have colonized exposed sediment with the most abundant species varying according to soil conditions. In intertidal marshes, willow cover declined in association with the development of hypersalinity after loss of the graminoid mat, but willow cover increased at the base of well-drained beach ridges and in a river delta with ample winter snow accumulation and freshwater flow in spring that protected ground vegetation. Most of the expected successional trends associated with isostatic uplift and changes in soil organic matter failed to occur because of intense goose foraging throughout the 20 years. The likelihood of sustained recovery of plant communities in the immediate coastal zone is very low, as long as goose numbers continue to increase. Indirect effects of vegetation loss (e.g., hypersalinity) and subsequent erosion of exposed sediments following grubbing will delay plant colonization and retard succession.","10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0269:GCIVAL]2.0.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329890","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-24744446592&doi=10.1657%2f1523-0430%282005%29037%5b0269%3aGCIVAL%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=755d055f5e4fffcef4ae7d747fcdc87f"

These fringing salt marshes are sometimes incorporated into shoreline stabilization efforts. We obtained data on elevation, salinity, sediment characteristics, vegetation and fish utilization at three study sites containing both natural fringing marshes and nearby restored marshes located landward of a stone sill constructed for shoreline stabilization. During the study, sediment accretion rates in the restored marshes were approximately 1.5- to 2-fold greater than those recorded in the natural marshes. Natural fringing marsh sediments were predominantly sandy with a mean organic matter content ranging between 1.5 and 6.0%. Average S. alterniflora stem density in natural marshes ranged between 130 and 222 stems m(-2), while mean maximum stem height exceeded 64 cm. After 3 years, one of the three restored marshes (NCMM) achieved S. alterniflora stem densities equivalent to that of the natural fringing marshes, while percentage cover and maximum stem heights were significantly greater in the natural than in the restored marshes at all sites. There was no significant difference in the mean number of fish, crabs or shrimp captured with fyke nets between the natural and restored marshes, and only the abundance of Palaemonetes vulgaris (grass shrimp) was significantly greater in the natural marshes than in the restored ones. Mean numbers of fish caught per 5 m of marsh front were similar to those reported in the literature from marshes adjacent to tidal creeks and channels, and ranged between 509 and 634 fish net(-1).

Large quantities of sediment deposited in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary by the Changjiang River promote the propagation of coastal wetlands, the expansion of saltmarsh vegetation, and carbon sequestration. In this study, using the Chongming Dongtan Wetland in the Changjiang estuary as the study area, the spatial and temporal distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the influences of sedimentation and vegetation on the SOC stocks of the coastal wetland were examined in 2013. There was sediment accretion in the northern and middle areas of the wetland and in the Phragmites australis marsh in the southern area, and sediment erosion in the Scirpus mariqueter marsh and the bare mudflat in the southern area. More SOC accumulated in sediments of the vegetated marsh than in the bare mudflat. The total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased in the above-ground biomass from spring to autumn and decreased in winter; in the below-ground biomass, they gradually increased from spring to winter. The TOC stocks were higher in the below-ground biomass than in the above-ground biomass in the P. australis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, but were lower in the below-ground biomass in S. mariqueter marsh. Stocks of SOC showed temporal variation and increased gradually in all transects from spring to winter. The SOC stocks tended to decrease from the high marsh down to the bare mudflat along the three transects in the order: P. australis marsh > S. alterniflora marsh > S. mariqueter marsh > bare mudflat. The SOC stocks of the same vegetation type were higher in the northern and middle transects than in the southern transect. These results suggest that interactions between sedimentation and vegetation regulate the SOC stocks in the coastal wetland in the Changjiang estuary.","10.1007/s00343-017-6054-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329909","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020871586&doi=10.1007%2fs00343-017-6054-0&partnerID=40&md5=1f6eb4f58b28125518b16e19b8002be7"

Sedimentation on top of the marker horizon since then shows two opposing tendencies. Coincident with salt marsh development the sediments display up to 1964 a fining upward sequence with an increasing content of organic matter. Since 1964 a nearby creek has meandered towards the sampling plot. Consequently, the sediments become coarser with a decreasing organic matter content. The morphological induced changes in sedimentary conditions strongly influence metal content in the sediments and thereby hide anthropogenic induced concentration variations. Thus, an apparently diminishing Zn content (per kg dry weight) since 1964 could indicate lesser load to the area. However, corrected for grain size effects there is an increasing content of Zn. Other metal concentrations (e.g. Cu) show a diminishing trend when corrected for grain size effects and therefore indicate a reduced anthropogenic induced load of these metals to the salt marsh.","10.1023/A:1014393201487","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329910","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036125989&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1014393201487&partnerID=40&md5=77592f857cddf18b82f695ee9a8a3064"

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.","10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329925","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7"

This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment.

Chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the features of these HSs. The results indicate that the studied HSs in the salt marsh sediments are mainly terrestrial-derived and that the sedimentary organic matter (SUM) in the top layer may contain more organic matter from marine sources and/or autochthonous materials due to the dramatic decreasing of the sediment supply as a result of damming. The degradation of labile carbohydrates and proteins and the preservation of refractory lignin components dominate the early diagenetic reactions of SUM in the salt marsh area. The average contents of the carboxylic groups in FAs and HAs are 11.64 +/- 1.08 and 7.13 +/- 0.16 meq/gC, and those of phenolic groups are 1.95 +/- 0.13 and 2.40 +/- 0.44 meq/gC, respectively. The content of carboxylic groups increased with increasing depth, while there were no obvious changes in the content of phenolic groups. The average concentration of total proton-binding sites is approximately 12.5 mu mol/g sediment for the studied HSs.

Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation.

Aerobic methanotrophs in coastal marsh soils are important methane consumers, but their activity and populations are poorly characterized. DNA stable-isotope probing followed by sequencing was used to determine how active methanotrophic populations differed in the main habitats of a Chinese coastal marsh. These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50-70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a significant correlation between the active bacterial communities and soil properties (salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and available phosphorus).

Tidal freshwater marshes had greater concentrations of organic C (10.81% w/w) and N (0.71% w/w) than brackish (7.71% C, 0.50% N) or salt (5.95% C, 0.35% N) marshes. Soil accretion rates of Cs-137 were greater in tidal freshwater (4.78 mm yr(-1)) and brackish marshes (4.41 mm yr(-1)) than in salt marshes (1.91 mm yr(-1)). Consequently, organic C and N accumulation was greater in tidal freshwater (124 and 8.2 g m-(2) yr(-1)) and brackish (93 and 6.5 g m(-2) yr(-1)) marshes than salt marshes (40 and 2.4 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Phosphorus accumulation was greater in the brackish marshes. Lower salinity tidal freshwater and brackish marshes remove more C, N, and P; however, salt marshes dominate the spatial extent of the study area (60%) vs. brackish (33%) and tidal freshwater marshes (7%). Combining measurements of C, N, and P accumulation with tidal marsh area, we estimated that tidal freshwater, brackish, and salt marshes stored or removed the equivalent of 2 to 20% of watershed N inputs entering the estuaries from the terrestrial landscape. After accounting for N, fixation and denitrification, tidal marshes collectively removed the equivalent of 13 to 32% of the N entering estuaries.

Tropical mangroves perform a critical role in the exchange and storage of terrestrial-marine carbon but can function as a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known of biogeochemical processes in temperate mangrove and salt marsh systems in the southern hemisphere. In this study, the soil/sediment exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O was measured seasonally along a natural transition from melaleuca woodland, salt marsh and into mangroves along the Mornington Peninsula edge of Westernport Bay, Victoria, Australia. Soil/sediment physiochemical properties and sediment C density were measured concurrently.The melaleuca woodland soil was a constant CH4 sink of approximately -25 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) but along the transect this rapidly switched to a weak CH4 source (<5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) in the salt marsh which increased further in the mangrove sediments where emissions of up to 375 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) were measured in summer. Sediment CH4 exchange correlated with salinity, pneumatophore number and the redox potential of sediment water at depth. All three ecosystems were a small N2O source of <10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Soil-atmosphere exchange was dominated by CO2 which showed a significant response according to ecosystem and season along with soil temperature and salinity. Sediment C density was significantly greater in the salt marsh than the mangrove. Salt marsh sediment C density was 168 Mg C ha(-1) which is comparable with that measured globally, whereas the mangrove sediment C density of 145 Mg C ha(-1) is among the lowest reported. Contrary to global patterns in terrestrial soil C content and salt marsh sediment C content, data from our study indicate that mangrove sediments from a cooler, drier temperate latitude may store less C than mangroves in warmer and wetter tropical latitudes. Understanding both C storage and the greenhouse gas balance of TSWs will help us to better value these vulnerable ecosystems and manage them accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These dieback areas remain devoid of plant growth for months to years. An analysis of microbial acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and porewater chemistry of four such diebacks has been carried out on marshes in the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, U.S.A. Four different diebacks were studied and sediments in all of them showed low rates of ARA, relative to sediments from the control areas which were populated by healthy S. alterniflora plants. The pore water of all the dieback sediments had higher salinities than the controls when this study began, but this trend was not consistent over the 18-month study period. Furthermore, dissolved ammonium and sulfide in the pore water, microbial biomass, organic matter and macro-organic matter content did not show a consistent trend differentiating the control and dieback sediments over this study period. During the course of this study, one of the diebacks recovered and the recolonisation of the barren area with healthy plants correlated with a full recovery of sediment ARA. The return of ARA to the sediments of this recovered marsh could not be correlated, however, with any of the porewater parameters measured (including NH4+), nor with any of the sediment characteristics. It is concluded that the lower levels of bacterial ARA in the diebacks may be due to the lack of essential factors associated with healthy spartina plants.

Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Yancheng tidal marsh to stabilize the sediments and gradually replaced the native plants. However, the changes in the soil bacterial community profile caused by S. alterniflora invasion are poorly characterized. Here, we used MiSeq sequencing to compare the composition of the bacterial community in soil at different depths under exotic S. alterniflora (SA), native Phragmites australis (PA), and native Suaeda salsa (SS). The results showed that the pH value was lower, but the salinity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and number of 16S rRNA genes were higher in SA soils than in PA and SS soils. Overall, Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae. Anaerolineae in the Chloroflexi phylum showed the greatest difference based on vegetation, accounting for 14.4% of the overall bacterial community in SA soils but only about 3.8% of those in PA and SS soils. The composition, interaction, and predicted functional profiles of the bacterial community in SA soils were significantly different from those in PA and SS soils, especially for functions related to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Salinity was negatively correlated with the Shannon index and accounted for 37.7% of the total variation in the bacterial community, making it the most important environmental factor.

Individual PSI values were highly variable, ranging from 19.5 to 175.6mg P 100g(-1) and varying by at least a factor of five within each of the three regions, and did not significantly differ between regions or between oiled and unoiled marshes. Soil pH, organic matter, total N, N:P ratio, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, and P saturation differed between regions, and all soil parameters showed great variability between and within individual marshes. Extractable iron was the strongest predictor of PSI across all regions, explaining between 51 and 95% of the variability in individual regions. PSI increased with distance from marsh edge in Terrebonne Bay where other soil properties exhibited similar trends. Results suggest mineral composition of marsh soils, influenced by elevation-inundation gradients, are critical in dictating P loading to estuaries and open waters, and overall marsh functioning. Further, within 2 years of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oiled marshes are able to sorb phosphorus at comparable levels as unoiled marshes.","10.1002/2013JG002486","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329965","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898804738&doi=10.1002%2f2013JG002486&partnerID=40&md5=0a256c12cb0545af16d4a089301ba428"

The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top - 0-20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions - wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of [approximately]1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.106071","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329973","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092107617&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2020.106071&partnerID=40&md5=255991054493970fd592e2cd396d98e5"

The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.","10.1023/A:1009731808445","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329978","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031395824&doi=10.1023%2fa%3a1009731808445&partnerID=40&md5=75bd307ee63d8e3eeda01ba99f1d4a6a"

Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.","10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.05.023","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329989","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068015450&doi=10.1016%2fj.agrformet.2019.05.023&partnerID=40&md5=4032d58a578338efeb2847f61338a479"

This assumption is centrally based on data compilations from marine sediments deposited under oxic and anoxic bottom waters. Since anoxia excludes the presence of infauna and sediment reworking, the observed differences in P burial are assumed to be driven by the presence of bioturbators. This reasoning however ignores the potentially confounding impact of bottom-water oxygenation on phosphorus burial. Here, our goal is to test the idea that bioturbation increases the burial of organic and inorganic phosphorus (P-org and P-inorg, respectively) while accounting for bottom-water oxygenation. We present solid-phase phosphorus speciation data from salt marsh ponds with and without bioturbation (Blakeney salt marsh, Norfolk, UK). In both cases, the pond sediments are exposed to oxygenated bottom waters, and so the only difference is the presence or absence of bioturbating macrofauna. Our data reveal that the rate of P-org and P-inorg burial are indistinguishable between bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments. A large terrestrial fraction of organic matter and higher sedimentation velocity than generally found in marine sediments (0.3 +/- 0.1 cm yr(-1)) may partially impact these results. However, the absence of a clear effect of bioturbation on total P burial puts into question the presumed importance of bioturbation for phosphorus burial.","10.5194/bg-18-1451-2021","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329998","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101596636&doi=10.5194%2fbg-18-1451-2021&partnerID=40&md5=1d559f309df011b2130018097a487272"

The increased topographic relief associated with the creekbank region is thought to control the unique chemistry and productivity found there. This study was designed to examine the role that tidal creeks play-during the natural development of a barrier island Spartina alterniflora marsh ecosystem on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA. A salt marsh chronosequence, resulting from a 1962 overwash event, was used as a 'space-for-time' substitution in order to define the changes that take place within this marsh over a successional time scale. The chronosequence of marshes is largely attributed to the variation in elevation across the overwash platform: younger marshes are higher relative to sea level. We used a principal components analysis on a suite of physico-chemical and biological variables. A single principle component explained 53% of the variability in the data and is used to describe the functional trajectory along which these marshes develop. This component is associated with an increase in sediment organic matter and nitrogen content (%N), porewater nutrients, S. alterniflora height, weight, %flowering and %N, and a decrease in grain size and redox potential. The factor scores from this analysis, which were used as a proxy for the functional maturity of the marsh, increased from creek edge to interior marsh for young marsh sites. Thus, the marsh nearest the creek most resembles the mature marsh. The temporal patterns of creek-water physico-chemistry vary between different aged creeks, suggesting that due to their small size and shallow depth younger creeks act to retain nutrients and particulates within the marsh. The hydrological, chemical and biological processes within the creeks themselves and at the creekbank are important in controlling the overall rate of marsh development. While creeks act to accelerate the rate of maturation, our results also indicate that not all marshes follow the same developmental trajectory and that the regional landscape may be a more important factor. With the increased interest in marsh restoration and creation for the mitigation of coastal wetland loss, there is a need for a greater functional understanding of the factors that control marsh development. The results of this study suggest that increasing creek frontage will increase the rate at which created marshes achieve functional equivalence with mature marshes.","10.3354/meps180161","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14329999","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033519406&doi=10.3354%2fmeps180161&partnerID=40&md5=688d23f231d8b686870f6f96b3aa304e"

Ant impacts were greatest in above-ground soils. All measured nutrient concentrations in above-ground mounds were significantly higher than the average values in reference soils (upper 25 cm). However, except for DOC, no significant differences for nutrient concentrations existed between soils under mounds and reference soils. The impacts of ant mounds on soil C and nutrient concentrations varied by ant species. L. niger above-ground mounds stored less C-org, TN and NO3- than F. candida and L. flavus mounds, or reference soils. At the ecosystem scale, soils in above-ground mounds and under ant mounds all contained less C-org per hectare than the reference soils. Total amounts in nutrient pools from mounds of the three ant species comprised from 5.3% to 7.6% of the total in natural marsh soils. More importantly, ant mounds increased the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient pools.

For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.","10.3389/fmars.2019.00014","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061346855&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2019.00014&partnerID=40&md5=ebb9945e4495907ebeed5203275d99c2"

This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay. This presents a possible mechanism for OM stabilization as marshes migrate inland.

The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders' density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 +/- 0.19m yr(-1) vs. -0.31 +/- 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 +/- 2.0 kg C m(-3) vs. 22.81 +/- 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 +/- 10.22 kg C m(-3)) than those with medium (13.99 +/- 1.23 kg C m(-3)) or high density (21.61 +/- 4.53 kg C m(-3)), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system.

This type of environment constitutes a large part of the Po River Delta (Italy), where intensive agricultural activities take place. Given the higher Ni background of Po River Delta soils and its water-soluble nature, the main aim of this contribution is to understand if reclamation can influence the Ni behavior over time. In this study, we investigated the geo-chemical features of 40 soils sampled in two different localities from the Po River Delta with different reclamation ages. Samples of salt marsh soils reclaimed in 1964 were taken from Valle del Mezzano while soils reclaimed in 1872 were taken nearby Codigoro town. Batch solubility tests and consecutive determination of Ni in pore-water were compared to bulk physicochemical compositions of soils. Bulk Ni content of the studied soils is naturally high, since these soils originated from Po River sediments derived from the erosion of ultramafic rocks. Moreover, it seems that Ni concentration increases during soil evolution, being probably related to the degradation of serpentine. Instead, the water-soluble Ni measured in the leaching tests is greater in soils recently reclaimed compared to the oldest soils. Soil properties of two soil profiles from a reclaimed wetland area were examined to determine soil evolution over one century. Following reclamation, pedogenic processes of the superficial horizons resulted in organic matter mineralization, pH buffer, and a decrease of Ni water solubility from recently to evolved reclaimed soil.","10.1007/s10661-017-6240-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029867656&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-017-6240-8&partnerID=40&md5=c6e8d2e52c5d44eee573fb67c90cd47b"

These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.","10.1016/j.csr.2018.01.005","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330036","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044392821&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d734e5a4562b0512ae5146a564922539"

It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.","10.1017/S0376892910000184","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330044","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952422314&doi=10.1017%2fS0376892910000184&partnerID=40&md5=350d1189b59a74e6740dea9dc8d28636"

The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.","10.1111/gcb.13158","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330045","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959542967&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13158&partnerID=40&md5=ae6ac69953785c11337ea555ade94708"

We determined the greenhouse gas balance of a tidal marsh exposed to nine years of experimental carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) manipulation. We estimated net carbon (C) gain rates by measuring changes in plant and soil C pools over nine years. In wetland soils that accrete primarily through organic matter inputs, long-term measurements of soil elevation, along with soil C density, provide a robust estimate of net soil C gain. We used net soil C gain along with methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to determine the radiative forcing of the marsh under elevated CO2 and N addition. Nearly all plots exhibited a net gain of C over the study period (up to 203 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and C gain rates were greater with N and CO2 addition. Treatment effects on C gain and methane emissions dominated trends in radiative forcing while nitrous oxide fluxes in all treatments were negligible. Though these soils experience salinities that typically suppress methane emissions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 can stimulate methane emissions, overcoming positive effects of elevated CO2 on C gain, converting brackish marshes that are typically net greenhouse gas sinks into sources. Adding resources, either CO2 or N, will likely increase ""blue carbon'' accumulation rates in tidal marshes, but importantly, each resource can have distinct influences on the direction of total greenhouse forcing.","10.1007/s10533-017-0312-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330048","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014988488&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-017-0312-2&partnerID=40&md5=38333b75a92b85c7a735e89b418a5c2c"

So far, information on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and determinants remains limited. Moreover, the role of complex ecological interactions in shaping SOC distribution is poorly understood. Here, we report detailed field surveys on plant, soil and crab burrowing activities in two inter-tidal salt marsh sites with similar habitat conditions in Eastern China. Our between-site comparison revealed slight differences in SOC storage and a similar vertical SOC distribution pattern across soil depths of 0-60 cm. Between the two study sites, we found substantially different effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC distribution. Complex interactions involving indirect effects between soil, plants and macrobenthos (crabs) may influence SOC distribution at a landscape scale. Marked differences in the SOC determinants between the study sites indicate that the underlying driving mechanisms of SOC distribution are strongly system-specific.

Comparison of the oxic Rumney Formation with the suboxic Wentlooge Formation shows that redox conditions control iron cycling, and that this in turn controls trace metal associations. An important fraction of the trace metals present in the Fe/Mn oxide phase in oxic sediments (such as the Rumney Formation) is remobilised during iron reduction and reprecipitated in other phases such as authigenic carbonates (as in the Wentlooge). Since many metal pollutants are highly redox sensitive, a better understanding of the effects of redox on metal speciation in estuarine sediments is useful for management of the coastal environment.

However, there is no consistent pattern on the effects of S. alterniflora invasions on microhabitats and benthic communities. The study first compared vegetation, water velocity, sediment deposition rate, sediment properties and benthic communities between invasive S. alterniflora and native Scirpus mariqueter patches using a pair-wise sampling design at 3 sites (Dongtan, Jiuduansha and Nanhui) in four seasons. The stands of S. alterniflora exhibited taller and less dense shoots, greater aboveground biomass and longer phenological phase than did S. mariqueter. S. alterniflora marshes had significantly lower water velocity, greater sediment deposition rates and higher light attenuation relative to S. mariqueter habitats. In general, sediment temperature, salinity, porosity, organic carbon content and microalgal biomass (Chla) did not significantly differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats at any of 3 sites. Thirty-four of 37 macrofauna species recorded did not exhibit density differences between habitat types. Limited influences on macrofauna were evident only at Dongtan where S. alterniflora marshes had significantly greater gastropod densities in the autumn. In 8 of 12 observations, benthic community structure did not differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats. It was concluded that the differences in physical structure were not enough to significantly change sediment properties, macrofaunal density and community structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Duplicate soil cores were obtained and sectioned for laboratory analysis. The fresh and brackish marsh soils were composed predominantly of organic matter, while the salt marsh soils were composed of predominantly minerals. Fresh marsh soils were generally the most oxidized and salt marsh soils the most reduced. In situ hydrogen sulfide emissions, but not potential sulfate reduction rates, were highest for the brackish marsh. Potential sulfate reduction assays may have overestimated in-situ rates, particularly for the more oxidized fresh marsh. Sulfate turnover times were longer in the salt marsh (approximately 40 days) than in either the fresh or the brackish marshes (3-8 days). Tidal action replenishes sulfate less frequently in the fresh and brackish marshes, thus sulfate depletions are more likely. The lowest potential sulfate reduction rates for all marshes occurred in winter.

We assessed SOC stocks and fractions in temperate mangrove (two sites) and saltmarsh (sites SM1, SM2 and SM3) environments in southern Australia. The SOC fractions were separated according to particulate organic carbon (POC), humic carbon (HC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) by size fractionation. Saltmarsh sites generally had the highest SOC content (up to 12.4% SOC). The POC fraction was the highest at the surface in the saltmarsh site and decreased relative to the HC and RC fractions with depth. Conversely, the proportion of POC at the mangrove sites did not decrease with depth, forming up to 76% of the SOC. The vertical displacement of soil of up to 5.8 mm year(-1) at the saltmarsh sites, measured using root ingrowth bags, suggest significant contributions of POC via root materials.

However, organic matter (OM) deposition and degradation/preservation processes are poorly understood, especially on the long-term and at molecular scales. We analysed sediment samples from six cores collected in tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses (up to 150 cm long cores spanning up to 10,000 yrs of OC accumulation) from Spencer Gulf (South Australia), by pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS), and we compared the results with elemental and stable isotope data, to decipher OM provenance and to assess degradation/preservation dynamics. The results showed that: (1) the major biopolymers preserved were polysaccharides, polyphenolic moieties (lignin and tannin) and polymethylenic moieties (e.g. cutin, suberin, chlorophyll) with smaller apportions of proteins and resins; (2) the OM originates predominantly from vascular plant materials (in particular lignocellulose) that have been well-preserved, even in some of the oldest sediments; (3) mangroves were found to be the most efficient OC sinks, partially explained by syringyl lignin preservation; (4) seagrasses were shown to store polysaccharide-enriched OM; (5) large proportions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) in surficial tidal marsh and mangrove sediments probably reflect pyrogenic OM from industrial combustion, and; (6) ""ecosystem shifts"", i.e. mangrove encroachment in tidal marsh and transition from seagrass to mangrove, were detected. Deposition environment and source vegetation control OC sequestration and there is no specific recalcitrant form of OM that is selectively preserved. For the first time, we demonstrate how analytical pyrolysis in combination with stable isotope analysis can be used to reconstruct (palaeo-)ecological shifts between different BCE. This study improves our knowledge on OC accumulation dynamics and the response of BCE to environmental change, which can inform the implementation of strategies for climate change mitigation.

Total nitrogen was determined by gas chromatography (CHNS-O elemental analyzer), and inorganic nitrogen, by photometry. The composition of hydrolyzable amino acids was analyzed by liquid chromatography on ion exchange resins. Mineral compounds accounted for an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (to 97% of the total content) was represented by organic substances (N-org). The N-org varied within a wide range in both marsh (0.3-15.8 g/kg) and tundra soils (5-20 g/kg in the peat horizons and 0.3-2 g/kg in the mineral horizons). The content of N-NH4+ varied from 5 to 20 mg/kg in marsh soils and from 30 to 200 mg/kg in tundra soils. In marsh soils, the content of nitrate nitrogen was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in the upper horizons. Marsh soils were characterized by the accumulation of N-org either on the surface or in the middle part of the profile in the presence of humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments. The accumulation of N-org and N-NH4+ was observed above the permafrost in the peat-gley soil and in the permafrost in the oligotrophic peat soil. The content of hydrolyzable amino acids in the soils of different geneses was 0.6-8 g/kg, which corresponded to 30-60% of the soil organic nitrogen and 2-12% of the soil organic carbon. Distribution patterns of the amino acid nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the soil profiles were similar. The qualitative composition of amino compounds was relatively uniform, and the ratios of most of them were close.

The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. We tested how plant community composition and vegetation structure differences across estuaries influence model development, and whether data from multiple sensors, in particular Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar and Landsat, can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n=409, RMSE=464 g/m2, 12.2% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass and carbon for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.","10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330111","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6"

The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1).

We analyzed surface and cored sediments from a salt marsh and adjacent upland sand dune in Cabretta Island, Georgia, USA, for total mercury (Hg-T), Hg isotopes and trace metal concentrations to better constrain the sources of Hg in this coastal environment. Hg-T concentrations are lower in the upland sands (1-6 ng/g) than in the marsh sediments (6-16 ng/g). Hg-T shows a positive correlation with total organic content (TOC) and increasing proportion of fines in the sediments. Trace metal concentrations also show a positive correlation with Hg-T in the marsh sediments regardless of chemical affinity (i.e. chalcophile, siderophile or lithophile). All these data are consistent with surface adsorption (either directly on to sediments or on to organic matter) as a dominant mechanism of Hg and metals accumulation in the marsh sediments. The surface sediments show significant mass independent fractionation (MIF) of odd Hg isotopes: the upland dune sands have zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199 (-0.07 parts per thousand to -0.14 parts per thousand) and the marsh surface sediments have positive Delta Hg-199 (0.48 parts per thousand to 0.79 parts per thousand). As in the surface samples, well-sorted sand layers in the cored sediments have low Hg concentrations and zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199, whereas fine particle-rich layers have higher Hg concentrations and positive Delta Hg-199 values. In the absence of any evidence for MIF of Hg isotopes by bacteria mediated methylation-demethylation reactions, the observed Hg isotope differences between marsh and upland sands can be explained by different sources of Hg. We suggest that local atmospheric Hg deposition dominates the Hg budget in the ombrotrophic upland sand, while the positive MIF in the marsh sediments are consistent with Hg dominantly of seawater origin. While in situ processes, like photoreduction and evasion can overprint the Hg depositional isotope signature, their effect on the sediments is currently unconstrained. Nevertheless, our data show that Hg isotopes can delineate different sources of Hg in a pristine coastal environment and at small spatial scales. Thus natural background isotope variability should be assessed as a baseline when Hg isotopes are used as tracers of Hg in anthropogenically-influenced sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

(3) Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature or volumetric moisture at a 5 cm depth, but it increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119 % averaged across the entire study period. (4) Air warming had no significant effect on total organic carbon, total nitrogen or the molar C/molar N ratio of the soil in the uppermost 10 cm layer during the 2 years of soil respiration measurement. The warming treatment also had no significant effect on aboveground biomass or fine root (< 2 mm) density during the second year of soil respiration measurement. (5) Soil temperature accounted for 81.0 % and 79.0 % of the temporal variations of soil respiration in the control (CON) and elevated temperature (ET) plots, respectively. No significant correlation between soil volumetric moisture and soil respiration was observed in either CON or ET. Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET. No change of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10) value) was observed.Based on above results, we speculate that soil porewater salinity was the key factor controlling the effects of air warming on soil respiration in the reclaimed salt marsh. Our results suggest that an air warming of approximately 1.5 A degrees C over the next few decades may not lead to a higher soil respiration in reclaimed salt marshes.","10.1007/s11104-013-1707-z","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330121","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884816335&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-1707-z&partnerID=40&md5=eedd2483ca4e0aafe4cafee3cdaf656b"

Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the approximate relative natural background P concentrations in the A horizon of six ecological communities; 2) to group the ecological communities according to P concentration and 3) to correlate other soil parameters to P concentrations. Eighty-nine surface soils (A horizons) from six of these communities which included freshwater marshes, swamp, hardwoods, salt water marshes, south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs were selected. The communities had water table depths <1 m. Some communities were submerged under water part of the year. Geometric means of total soil P (TP) using a hypobromite determination ranged from 23 mg kg(-1) in the sloughs to 438 mg kg(-1) in the salt marshes. Soil extractable P (EP) using Mehlich I extracting solution ranged from 4.7 mg kg(-1) in the north Florida flatwoods to 64.5 mg kg(-1) in the salt water marshes. Using statistical analysis, the six communities could be separated in distinct groups. Using TP, the first group included swamp hardwoods, fresh water marshes and salt marshes, and the second group was south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs. A similar relationship was found for the EP. The correlation coefficient between EP and TP was r = 0.77. Correlations with other soil properties (clay, organic carbon, total Al, total Fe, total Ca) were also made, and the communities were found to be grouped in the same way as they did with EP and TP.

To determine the impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC), we studied the vertical and horizontal distribution of SOC. And stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the impact of the age of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC in Chongming Dongtan wetland located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The results showed that the SOC concentration was higher in the S. alterniflora community than that in the native Phragmites australis community. The age of invasion and the SOC concentration increased with increasing elevation, while the SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth. The delta C-13 value became less negative at greater depth, which was related to the contribution from C-13-enriched carbon sources after 3 years of invasion. After 7 and 10 years, the delta(13)value became more negative at greater depth in both communities. S. alterniflora had a positive effect on the soil carbon pool, and its contribution was related to soil depth. In the low tidal marshes, the contribution of S. alterniflora was negatively correlated with soil depth, while it was positively correlated with soil depth in the high tidal marshes.

To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106326","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330143","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109371665&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2021.106326&partnerID=40&md5=3216bf8eb5f1c654c048f3e3ffbb3050"

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.","10.1002/ecs2.2828","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330145","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071876530&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2828&partnerID=40&md5=8ee8e41bcbae01c6b05213a5d140f208"

We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.","10.23818/limn.38.42","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330146","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068908899&doi=10.23818%2flimn.38.42&partnerID=40&md5=2c67bdc9ead6e170e0933ee9d9300432"

In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.","10.1007/s00248-018-1168-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330152","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043696170&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-018-1168-2&partnerID=40&md5=bec71221eea542c930e65bb8a699eb16"

The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution of halophytes and crabs in a macrotidal salt marsh, and to determine effects of the combination of crabs and halophytes on the physicochemical properties of soils. Vegetation structure and soil properties in relation to seed dispersion distance and habitat type were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Cluster Analysis (CA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Plant biomass and height of individual marsh plants tended to be higher at distances > 1 m from stands of parent plants. Crabs preferred habitats with high vegetation cover. Low densities of burrowing crabs and halophytes also caused considerable changes in soil properties. The combination of crabs and halophytes increased the spatial variability of physicochemical parameters in these salt marsh soils. Thus these combinations may be important to a complete understanding of plant distribution and soil nutrient cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.029","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330154",NA

We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0 mm yr(-1) circa 1900 to 3.6 mm yr(-1) at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1), increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we studied the shifts of microbial communities and soil multifunctionality (SMF; nine functions related with C, N and P cycling) along a vegetation gradient in a salt marsh ecosystem and investigated the microbial diversity - ecosystem function relationship. The aboveground vegetation shifted from mud flat (MF) to Scirpus triqueter (SM) and then Phragmites australis (PA) with increasing distance away from the sea. Average approach showed that the SMF was much higher in halophytes covered zones including SM and PA than in MF. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis confirmed that vegetation was an important predictor on SMF besides moisture and organic carbon. Linear regression and multiple threshold methods showed that in MF and SM zones, fungal rather than bacterial richness was significantly and positively correlated with SMF, while in the PA zone microbial diversity did not relate with SMF. Random forest analysis identified several Ascomycota taxa with preference over marine environment as strong predictors of SMF.

Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized. Our findings point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column.","10.1029/2017JG004211","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330162","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059280963&doi=10.1029%2f2017JG004211&partnerID=40&md5=7151041e0a484e2ac9361b2d4fd3d1c1"

At the same time, fiddler crab (Uca spp.) distributions have expanded and purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing on creekbank vegetation has increased. Sea-level rise and reduced predation pressure drive these changing crab populations but most studies focus on one species; there is a need for community-level assessments of impacts from multiple crab species. There is also a need to identify additional factors that can affect crab populations. We sampled crabs and environmental parameters in four Rhode Island salt marshes in 2014 and compiled existing data to quantify trends in crab abundance and multiple factors that potentially affect crabs. Crab communities were dominated by fiddler and green crabs (Carcinus maenas); S. reticulatum was much less abundant. Burrow sizes suggest that Uca is responsible for most burrows. On the marsh platform, burrows and Carcinus abundance were negatively correlated with elevation, soil moisture, and soil percent organic matter and positively correlated with soil bulk density. Uca abundance was negatively correlated with Spartina patens cover and height and positively correlated with Spartina alterniflora cover and soil shear strength. Creekbank burrow density increased dramatically between 1998 and 2016. During the same time, fishing effort and the abundance of birds that prey on crabs decreased, and water levels increased. Unlike in other southern New England marshes where recreational overfishing is hypothesized to drive increasing marsh crab abundance, we propose that changes in crab abundance were likely unrelated to recreational finfish over-harvest; instead, they better track sea-level rise and changing abundances of alternate predators, such as birds. We predict that marsh crab abundance will continue to expand with ongoing sea-level rise, at least until inundation thresholds for crab survival are exceeded.","10.7717/peerj.4876","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330164","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047810574&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.4876&partnerID=40&md5=64d96b0db049718822a0d71a2f200d1e"

However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition. The results suggest that 10-year S. alterniflora invasion significantly alters soil organic C and N pools sizes and stability through changing plant residuals input, physical distribution of S. alterniflora-derived C and C turnover in SOM fractions.

To examine the abundance and speciation of iron, six iron species (poor crystalline Fe(III), crystalline Fe(III), non-sulfidic Fe(II), porewater Fe2+, FeS, and FeS2) were investigated in a cross transect (span = 250 m, depth = similar to 1.2 m) in a tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea. The results suggested that sediment characteristics, pH, redox condition, conductivity, chloride, sulfate, and organic matter create a highly heterogeneous geochemical framework in the cross transect. Correspondingly, the zonation of iron species differed significantly across the tidal marsh. Poor crystalline Fe(III) (48 +/- 24 mu mol g 1) and crystalline Fe(III) (75 +/- 32 mu mol g 1) accumulated on the surface of the high-tide zone and decreased with elevation. The non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals (140 +/- 61 mu mol g 1) accounted for the largest proportion of the six iron species. The porewater Fe2+ was enriched within the deep layer of the upland region (pH = 6.2-6.5) and exhibited a maximum of 11.49 mM. The aqueous sulfide concentration was below detection. FeS (39 +/- 6 mu mol g 1) and FeS2 (57 +/- 25 mu mol g 1) accumulated closer to the lower extremity. Tidal water brought O-2 and removed certain amounts of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and Fe(III)-bearing particles in an element budget during tidal inundation. Variations of topography, tidal hydrology, seawater intrusion, and organic matter altered the dominant organic matter oxidation pathway and further affected iron mineralization.

Seventy-four quadrats were sampled randomly along five transects at right angles to the main Hapuka River. Eight plant communities comprising 141 native and thirteen exotic vascular species, were differentiated using multivariate analyses, from bare mud (mean elevation 1.23 +/- 0.24 m above Mean Low Water Spring (MLWS)), saltmarsh and shrubland associations through to the adjacent podocarp-broadleaved rain forest (4.53 +/- 0.74 m above MLWS). Bulk density of the upper 10 cm of substrate varied from a maximum of 1.15 g cm(-3) in the lowest elevation association to a minimum of 0.15 g cm(-3) in the rain forest. pH showed a similar trend with values of 6.97 and 4.31, respectively.

As burrows may affect important chemical and biological processes that influence belowground plant production and decomposition, experimental manipulations were designed to modify fiddler crab burrow density by either increasing them (artificially constructed holes) or decreasing them (exclosures) and comparing them to areas naturally with and without fiddler crab burrows. The only significant difference among treatments was associated with the presence of holes without regard for whether they were artificial or natural. Higher burrow density resulted in an increase in soil redox potential, which most likely caused higher decomposition, even though sulfate-reduction rates were not different among treatments. Belowground production decreased with increased burrow density resulting in less OM addition to the soil. Higher decomposition and lower belowground production resulted in a net loss of 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in marshes with higher burrow densities, while areas with few to no burrows accumulated up to 245 g C m(-2) yr(-1), equaling a surface accretion rate of 4 mm yr(-1). Examination of 6 other salt marshes in the region revealed a negative correlation between fiddler crab density and soil OM content, lending strength to the argument that bioturbation is a potentially important explanatory factor of OM accumulation in salt marshes and may influence how sea level rise impacts coastal marshes.","10.3354/meps08708","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330181","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957731005&doi=10.3354%2fmeps08708&partnerID=40&md5=ce19a58e35fe80a669cabbfda322a501"

Restoration projects address marsh loss, yet it remains unclear how well restored marshes grow, expand, and function in eutrophic waters. Here, we explored how a facultative mutualism between Atlantic ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and cordgrass Spartina alterniflora may enhance marsh growth and nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic setting. We created experimental plots in Jamaica Bay, NY, that contained live mussels, mussel shells, or no mussels (control). After 9 wk, we measured sediment and plant characteristics. We also collected sediment cores for use in continuous flow-through incubations with ambient site water and water enriched with stable isotope-labeled nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15). Denitrification in marsh plots with live mussels was significantly higher than the other treatments. Live mussels likely enhanced denitrification as biodeposits increased sediment organic carbon and anaerobic conditions. Mussel treatments did not impact cordgrass growth, possibly due to the eutrophic conditions of our study system or the duration of our trials. Ribbed mussels may be a valuable addition for salt marsh restoration projects in eutrophic estuaries since they increase the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal.

The annual secondary productivity and P/B ratio of the macrobenthos in the flat were estimated as 18.58 g AFDM (ash free dry mass) . m(-2) . a(-1) and 0.97, respectively, and the secondary productivity in the Spartina alterniflora marshes of the upper intertidal flat (8.97g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)) was much lower than that in the bare flat of the lower intertidal zone (28.19 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), Since the introduction of S. alterniflora by the end of the 1980s, the secondary productivity of the macrobenthos in the flat had increased about 4 folds. Musculus senhousei, which inhabited in the lower bare flat, contributed 66.4% of the total macrobenthos secondary productivity in the entire intertidal flat. If the contribution from M. senhousei was not taken into account, the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the salt marshes would be significantly higher than that in the bare flat, and the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the intertidal flat would have less change. The successful colonization of M. senhousei was partly attributed to the changes of sediment composition enhanced by S. alterniflora due to its capability in trapping fine-grained materials; this species' feeding activities result in a remarkable increase of sediment chlorophyll a content. There was a significant positive correlation between the secondary productivity of macrobenthos and the sediment chlorophyll a and/or organic matter contents.

We related phenotypic variation in twelve salt marsh plant species from six families to variation in four environmental variables using multiple regression. Within species, plant phenotype was predictably related to environmental variation. Salinity was the most common predictor of plant traits, followed by organic content, water content and elevation. Across species, regressions of single plant trait CVs on range (2 X SD) of single environmental variables were not significant and did not support the hypothesis that species occupying broad environmental ranges would have broad ranges in phenotypes. However, regression of a composite phenotypic PCAI on a composite environmental PCAI showed a marginally significant (P = 0.054) linear relationship for 10 species. Considering the different patterns of response across species, the lack of a relationship between variation in single phenotypic traits and single environmental variables is likely because the distantly-related taxa employed fundamentally different morphological and physiological strategies to respond to environmental stress gradients. The significant relationship between composite environmental and phenotypic variables reflects the complex nature of species phenotypic response to multivariate environmental gradients. Specifically, in this system, species increase variation in the number of leaves, but decrease variation in leaf size in response to an increase in range of salinity and decrease in range of water and organic content.","10.1007/s11258-004-0841-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330190",NA

In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter.Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant.While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

The impact of the regressive stage on the environment is seen in the development of the regressive LGPs in the soils and sediments of the coastal landscapes with a predominance of salinization and weak humus accumulation. The transgression of the sea was accompanied by the formation of specific lagoon-marsh landscapes, in which the accumulation of sulfides, gleyzation, iron oxidation, and humus formation were clearly pronounced. The general scheme of the evolution of the LGPs within the past 30 years is discussed. The rates of the humus accumulation and salinization during the stabilization stage are estimated. The organic matter reserves in the coastal soils increased by 1.5-2 times in a decade. The transformation of the particular forms of chemical elements in the lagoon-marsh landscapes upon fluctuations in the sea level is shown. The rise in the Caspian sea level was accompanied by the enhanced migration of elements with varying valences, such as Fe and Mn (as well as Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Co) due to their mobilization in the slightly alkaline and neutral reducing conditions and their precipitation at the geochemical barriers.","10.1134/S1064229312010073","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330195",NA

The magnitude of variability among and within pedons substantiates the importance of establishing a feasible sampling protocol. However, because of the great variability of tidal marsh soils, there is often the need to balance the desire for high confidence level and accuracy with the need for a reasonable sampling protocol. This was accomplished by accepting an 80% confidence level and 20% accuracy rather than more rigorous estimates and was achieved by making a single observation to estimate the thickness of the organic horizon and by collecting three samples, on average, within 1 to 2 m to estimate total sulfur and organic carbon.","10.1097/00010694-199901000-00007","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330196","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032967608&doi=10.1097%2f00010694-199901000-00007&partnerID=40&md5=e73a19153d0222fef4e98cbeabacf8f8"

In all sites, earthworms dominated the biomass of soil fauna, the dominant species being Octolasion tyrtaeum in marsh soil, Octolasion cyaneum in peat soil, Allolobophora chlorotica in gley soil, and Lumbricus rubellus in all three sites. The enchytraeid communities composed of 7-10 species, differed widely between sites.While the summer flood of 2002 reduced annelid populations in peat soil to zero, in gley soil only enchytraeids were sharply reduced. The earthworms there probably were less affected because of shorter duration of the flood, the lower air temperatures and SOM contents and the diapause of the dominant A. chlorotica. During summer drought in 2003, earthworms and enchytraeids were absent from gley soil, while they had maximum abundances in peat soil. The marsh soil, structured by a microrelief of shallow ditches and ridges, had highest densities of annelids. As it was not subjected to summer flooding in 2002, populations of both earthworms and potworms were stable. The drought in 2003 led to a sharp decrease in earthworm abundance in July, while the enchytraeids reached maximum values. Dynamics and survival strategies of different annelid species are discussed.The water holding capacity as well as the organic matter content of the soil are important factors for annelids in sites subjected to such hydrological extremes.To promote terrestrial annelids, controlled flooding should be kept short, especially in winters following natural summer floods. If possible, recovery times for annelids should be guarenteed, that is 2-3 months without inundations for enchytraeids and about half a year for earthworms. A microrelief with drier refuge sites can be judged as favourable for earthworms. An artificially raised groundwater table will favour annelids during drought periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Impacts of S. alterniflora on the inter-tidal macrobenthos community in the Jiangsu coastland are addressed by comparing the macrobenthos characteristics in a mudflat and in a four-year-old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. During the period October 2002-July 2003, we studied the distribution pattern and diversity of macrobenthos, and discussed their correlation with environmental factors caused by Spartina vegetation. The results showed that a total of 43 macrobenthos species were found, mainly consisting of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Annelida. Ten macrobenthos species were found in the Spartina salt marsh, and 36 species were found in the mudflat. Life forms and functional groups of macrobenthos in the Spartina salt marsh were obviously distrinct from that of the mudflat. The study showed that macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh decreased, and the community structure altered obviously, whereas the biomass showed no differences in different seasons. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seasonal change of macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh negatively related to content of sediment organic matter, total N, bulk density, height and biomass of Spartina vegetation, and positively related to the density of Spartina. All these differences suggested the obvious effects of the Spartina vegetation on the Jiangsu inter-tidal benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. Furthermore, the investigation also showed that the niche of the native macrobenthos living in the mudflat has been transferred down, seaward, due to the invasion of Spartina in our study site.

Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens.

Northern hemisphere research dominates the earlier saltmarsh carbon sequestration literature, recently augmented by analyses across mainland Australia where species assemblages, catchment histories and environmental settings differ. No previous assessment has been made for Tasmania. Carbon stores and accumulation rates in saltmarsh sediments of the Rubicon estuary, Tasmania, were investigated. Carbon was determined from sediment cores by Elemental Analyser, combined with analysis of organic content and bulk density. Carbon accumulation was determined using short-term and long-term sediment accretion indicators. Results showed carbon densities to be lower than global averages, with variation found between carbon stores of native and introduced species zones. Cores from introduced Spartina anglica indicated a trend of higher sediment carbon percentages relative to cores from native saltmarsh Juncus kraussii and Sarcocornia quinqueflora, and in finer grain sizes. Sediment carbon stock of 30 cm depths was 49.5 Mg C ha(-1) for native saltmarsh and 55.5 Mg C ha(-1) for Spartina. Carbon percentages were low owing to high catchment inorganic sediment yields, however carbon accumulation rates were similar to global averages, particularly under Spartina. Covering 85% of saltmarsh area in the estuary, Spartina contributes the majority to carbon stores, potentially indicating a previously unrecognized value for this invasive species in Australia.","10.3390/biology7020027","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330210","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046437378&doi=10.3390%2fbiology7020027&partnerID=40&md5=c60b73ff09610fda5ab0cf464f6a991e"

Species cover, soil salinity, and the groundwater level were monitored between 1991 and 1993 and between 2002 and 2004, and total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrates, ammonium and exchangeable phosphorus were measured in the soils in both study periods. In addition, three soil profiles were described in August 1992 and August 2004. The results indicate an elevation of the water table throughout the 13-year period, which was attributable to water flowing from areas with intensive agriculture. Flooding increased and soil salinity dropped in the most saline sites and increased in the least saline ones. The morphology of the soil profiles reflected the increase in flooding periods, clue to the appearance of a greyer matrix in the deeper horizons and a more diffuse pattern of Fe mottles. Following these environmental changes, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Phragmites australis and Juncus maritimus strongly expanded at the wettest sites, which led to the disappearance of the original zonation pattern. The cover of Limonium delicatulum, in turn, decreased with the increase in moisture but increased following the increase in salinity. Changes in soil nutrients were only very evident in the sandy soils of the beach, probably due to the influence of organic debris deposited on the shoreline by the storms and due to the strong increase in the colonisation of this habitat by perennial species. According to the results obtained, control measures are needed in order to preserve habitat diversity in this and other salt marshes of this area. Monitoring of the vegetation distribution could be a useful tool to identify environmental impacts, in order to implement remedial actions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.","10.1002/2017JG003780","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330224","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020705442&doi=10.1002%2f2017JG003780&partnerID=40&md5=cc8df285de677dc95dfa9e92f1285784"

We initiated a field experiment in a microtidal Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) dominated salt marsh in Connecticut (USA) to examine how a silt-loam dredge applied at different thicknesses (low: +5 cm, medium: +10 cm, and high: +15 cm) altered biological and biogeochemical responses. Over two growing seasons we monitored plant responses (above and belowground biomass, stem height, stem density, leaf area) and soil-biogeochemical parameters (EC, pH, redox, NH4+, sulfides, C:N, decomposition, bulk density, carbon fluxes). We found adding 5-7 cm of dredged sediment promoted rapid revegetation, alleviated phytotoxic sulfides, enhanced CO2 uptake, and reduced CH4 emissions. Low treatments reached similar vegetation cover to controls after one growing season, though sediment treatments greater than 10-cm thick showed delayed growth. Low levels of sediment addition stimulated the highest root biomass in the underlying soil, promoting CO2 efflux, but this was offset by aboveground biomass productivity, promoting net CO2 uptake. Phytotoxic sulfides were reduced in all sediment addition treatments, but our data indicate that coastal managers aiming to promote rapid vegetative recovery while increasing elevation in the short term should target conservative depths (< 10 cm) when using fine-grained dredged material. Collectively, our work will guide wetland managers as they develop restoration specifications for perpetuating coastal marshes in the face of rising seas.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106495","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330233","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119580352&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2021.106495&partnerID=40&md5=ac1716febca2a989c76702d619dc1693"

Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.","10.1890/10-2037.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330237","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051955666&doi=10.1890%2f10-2037.1&partnerID=40&md5=e96b2c3ff336749aa1cda07f28f373eb"

It was found that the chemical and physicochemical properties of marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols) are largely dictated by the distance from the sea and elevation of the sampling point above sea level. The spatial distribution of the soil properties is described by a quadratic trend surface. With an increase in the distance from the sea, the concentration of ions in the soil solution decreases, and the organic carbon content and soil acidity become higher. The spatial dependence of the degree of variability in the soil properties is moderate. Regular changes in the soil properties along the sea-land gradient are accompanied by the presence of specific spatial patterns related to the system of temporary water streams, huge boulders, and beached heaps of sea algae and wood debris. The cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish between five soil classes corresponding to the following plant communities: barren surface (no permanent vegetation), clayey-sandy littoral with sparse halophytes, marsh with large rhizomatous grasses, and grass-forb-bunchberry vegetation of forest margins. The subdivision into classes is especially distinct with respect to the concentration of chloride ions. The following groups of factors affect the distribution of vegetation: the composition of the soil solution, the height above sea level, the pH of water suspensions, and the humus content.","10.1134/S1064229315030114","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330238","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925019785&doi=10.1134%2fS1064229315030114&partnerID=40&md5=4658d47328c4acfeb5e3394258de1d75"

We compared nine years of field measurements between three restored marshes (Dennis, Commercial, and Maurice River Townships) and a reference marsh (Moores Beach) in the mesohaline portion of Delaware Bay. In the process, we compared channel morphology, geomorphology, vegetation, sediment organic matter, fish assemblages, blue crabs, horseshoe crabs, benthic infauna, and diamondback terrapins. For fishes we compared structural (distribution, abundance) and functional (feeding, growth, survival, reproduction, production) aspects to evaluate the restored marshes in an Essential Fish Habitat context. Marsh vegetation and drainage density responded gradually and positively with restored marshes approximating the state of the reference marsh within the nine-year study period. The fauna responded more quickly and dramatically with most measures equal or greater in the restored marshes within the first one or two years after restoration. Differences in response time between the vegetation and the fauna imply that the faunal response was more dependent on access to the shallow intertidal marsh surface and intertidal and subtidal creeks than on characteristics of the vegetated marsh. The fishes in created subtidal creeks in restored marshes responded immediately and maintained fish assemblages similar to the reference marsh over the study period. The intertidal creek fish assemblages tended to become more like the reference marsh in the last years of the comparison. Overall, these results document the success of the restoration and how marshes function for both resident and transient fauna, especially fishes.","10.1007/s11160-007-9066-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330244","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38049016442&doi=10.1007%2fs11160-007-9066-6&partnerID=40&md5=094a994a374b3af3aca4d9b641a2d623"

This study explored the ability of using testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) from sediments of a freshwater tidal marsh as indicators of water level in an inland estuary. The hypothesis was that modern testate amoeba assemblages change with surface elevation (approximately the duration of tidal flooding) within a freshwater tidal marsh. Variation in testate amoeba assemblages in relation to multiple environmental variables and sediment characteristics was studied through redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that a significant part of the variation in modern testate amoeba assemblages could be explained by flooding frequency, surface elevation, organic content and particle size of the soil. Transfer functions, partial least squares and weighted average regressions were made to show that testate amoebae can be used for reconstruction of water level (with an accuracy of 0.05 Normalized Elevation). A preliminary test of application of the transfer function to palaeo testate amoeba assemblages showed promising results. Testate amoebae from a freshwater tidal marsh provide a potentially powerful new tool for estuarine water-level reconstructions.

Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the ""optimum"" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.","10.1002/ecy.1698","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330250",NA

Groundwater levels, soil pH and Eh were measured 'in situ' for a 12-month period in each sampling plot, and total calcium carbonate was also determined. Low concentrations of soluble metals (maximum Mn 1.089 mg L-1 and maximum Zn 0.553 mg L-1) were found in the watercourses. However, total metal contents were extremely high in the soils of a zone of the salt marsh (maximum 1,933 mg kg(-1) of Mn, 62,280 mg kg(-1) of Zn, 16,845 mg kg(-1) of Pb, 77 mg kg(-1) of Cd, 418 mg kg(-1) of Cu and 725 mg kg(-1) of As), and soluble metals in the pore water reached 38.7 mg L-1 for Zn, 3.15 mg L-1 for Pb, 48.0 mg L-1 for Mn, 0.61 mg L-1 for Cd and 0.29 mg L-1 for As. Variable concentrations with depth indicate a possible re-mobilisation of the metals, which could be related to spatial and temporal variations of water table level, pH and Eh and to the presence of calcium carbonate. A tendency for the Eh to decrease in the warmest months and to increase in the coldest ones was found, especially, in plots that received water with a high content of dissolved organic carbon.

Marsh migration represents a primary mechanism for marsh survival in the face of sea-level rise and leads to a fundamental reorganization of vegetation communities. Yet, the ecological implications of these changes remain unknown. To evaluate the effect of marsh migration on ecosystem function, we compared habitat, primary production, vertical accretion, nutrient cycling, and carbon accumulation between new and old salt marsh on Goodwin Island (Virginia, USA) where salt marsh is migrating landward into rapidly retreating coastal forest. Using historical imagery and radioisotopic dating of sediment cores, we determined marsh age (< 3 to approximately 616 years) across the landscape. We found that salt marsh functions generally depended more on elevation and/or landscape position than marsh age. Primary production and nutrient cycling (%C and %N soil content) did not vary significantly with marsh age. Accretion and carbon accumulation rates varied predictably with elevation in old marsh but not in new marsh. Instead, trends in soil formation were controlled by the colonization of Phragmites australis, a dominant plant in migrating marsh-forest boundaries along the Atlantic Coast. Vegetation zonation patterns were more clearly defined in old marsh, indicating that habitat types take time to develop. However, these vegetation differences did not translate to consistently different ecological functions. These observations suggest that marsh migration does not lead to permanent differences in ecological functions between new and old marsh, rather ecological functions will converge as new marsh ages.","10.1007/s10021-021-00652-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330253","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107459073&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00652-6&partnerID=40&md5=866575392d526b60ccf2aa2f90c31024"

These littoral zones are characterized by their extreme shallowness (with a mean depth of less than 1 m) and their high content of organic matter, which in relative terms is highest in the surface sediments (between 1.2% and 2.6% organic carbon). Under these conditions, an intensive benthic regeneration of nutrients takes place, with mean fluxes in the zone of 83.2 +/- 36.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of inorganic carbon, 6.36 +/- 4.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of NH4+, 1.14 +/- 0.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of HPO42- and 4.54 +/- 2.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of SiO2.

In this work, the concentrations of inorganic carbon and nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, HPO42- and SiO2) have been determined at three different depths, every hour, during complete tidal cycles. Simultaneously, the current velocities at different depths have been measured continuously. From this set of experimental data, calculations have been made of the evolution of the instantaneous velocities of these substances at each end of the channel, and by integration, the net balance for the complete tidal cycle. In general terms, there is an export of inorganic carbon and nutrients with the tides, although the net transports are very variable and depend to a large extent on the hydrodynamics of the zone.

Bulk density and organic C were grouped by depositional environments, and average mass of C per unit volume and C accumulation rates in each depositional environment were calculated. The total organic C sequestered and rates of sequestration in each depositional environment were in the following order from most (fastest) to least (slowest): lagoon, intertidal, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, aeolian. This study demonstrated that high levels of organic C are sequestered per unit volume of sediment (35.9 +/- 3.2 kg m(-3)), and the mean rate of C accumulation was high (0.033 +/- 0.0029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)) over a long time period (5000 years). Results of this study strongly demonstrate the importance and necessary high priority for preserving and restoring coastal wetlands both in the USA and internationally. However, despite their excellent potential to sequester C, significant losses of coastal wetlands are occurring in the United States and elsewhere in the world. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to clarify the biogeomorphic role of oligochaete bioturbation in facilitating or hindering vegetation establishment. Two microcosm experiments were performed to assess the effect of oligochaete bioturbation on sediment properties, oxidation depth, algal biomass, seed distribution, and germination success of pioneer species Salicornia spp. Oligochaetes created burrow networks in the sediment matrix, which, together with upward conveyor belt feeding, lead to substrate mixing. Sediment reworking rates of oligochaetes were compared with those of polychaete macrofauna. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation of burrows can stimulate resource flows into the sediment. Oxidation depth increased almost tenfold in the presence of oligochaetes. Their bioturbation did not seem to affect sediment properties such as dry bulk density, porosity, and organic matter content. Sediment reworking, however, significantly reduced algal biomass at the surface with possible cascading effects on sediment stability and erodibility. Oligochaete conveyor belt feeding buried Salicornia spp. seeds until below the critical germination depth, thus negatively affecting Salicornia spp. germination and seedling establishment. Our study indicates that small, though numerous, oligochaete bioturbators may reduce lateral expansion potential of salt marshes by hindering the establishment of pioneer vegetation in the transition zone. Additionally, in dynamic fine-grained habitats, these oligochaetes have the feature to quickly oxygenate the sediment top layer.","10.1002/ecs2.1872","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330265","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025431369&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.1872&partnerID=40&md5=177c7c0f2cba7cdaac492a65c91c3c8a"

Both sites possess catchments devoid of major industries, allowing an indication of regional pollution levels to be approximated. Profiles of heavy metal concentrations were interpreted by considering diagenetic effects, with conclusions supported by grain size and organic carbon determinations, An increase in heavy metal concentrations landwards was observed, resultant upon increased organic components in the sediment and a dominance of metal-humic complexes. Concentrations of lead, copper, zinc, chromium and manganese were found to be relatively low for both sites, although an increase in anthropogenic input in recent sediments was implied.

Helice tientsinensis is the dominant crab species which inhabits almost the entire intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta. However, for a long time we ignored the crab bioturbation in this area. We know little about whether crabs have potential effects on sediment environment. Here, we investigated the crab burrow characteristics in three marsh zones, and we also analysed the sediment parameters among crab burrow mounds (chimneys), flats (flat areas between burrows), controls (outside of crab bed) and crab fecal deposit. We found that sediment was softer in crab burrow mounds than in flat and control areas. Higher crab density indicates softer sediment. Crab burrow mounds had saltier soil than the flats. Our results showed that sediment total nitrogen, total carbon and organic matter varied among mounds, flats, controls and crab fecal deposit, which indicated that crab bioturbation have potential effects on sediments redistribution and nutrients cycling. Our study is essential to clear the roles of crabs in ecosystems and will benefit for coastal saltmarsh protection and restoration.","10.1007/s13157-020-01341-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330268","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089296828&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-020-01341-1&partnerID=40&md5=33cf045596573860883e7328cebc413b"

Soil P fractions at different depths in newly formed wetlands along a salinity gradient in Yellow River Delta (China) were studied using a modified Hedley fraction method. The total P (Pt) content ranged from 471.1 to 694.9 mg?kg1, and diluted HCl-extractable inorganic P (Dil-HCl-Pi) ranged from 324 to 524.2 mg?kg1. The Dil-HCl-Pi is the predominant P form in all profiles, with on average 70% of the Pt extracted as Pi. Organic P (Po) comprised (4.2 +/- 2.0)% (mean +/- SD) of the Pt, due to low organic-matter content in coastal salt marsh ecosystems. The labile P (resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi, and NaHCO3-Po) and moderately labile P (NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po) concentrations were both low, ranged from 11.6 to 38.1 and 2.8 to 21.3 mg?kg1, respectively, constituting (3.7 +/- 1.1)% and (2.0 +/- 0.7)%, respectively, of Pt, suggesting low availability of P to plants in these soils. Our results suggested that vegetation cover significantly influenced soil P dynamics and availability. In particular, the labile P content under Tamarix chinensis increased significantly by 23.2%145.5% compared with adjacent soils.

Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services.","10.1029/2019JG005473","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330271","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089918240&doi=10.1029%2f2019JG005473&partnerID=40&md5=484af1dae156f948db6ec667f6ffa60e"

However, these wetlands are increasingly altered by rising seas and invasive species, and have been affected by historical managementsuch as tidal manipulation.We conducted a survey of 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 tidally restored, 10 unrestricted references) in 2017 to quantify carbon mineralization, denitrification potential, microbial community composition, above and belowground biomass and a suite of sediment characteristics. Carbon density was our only paramenter thatdiffered between unrestricted and tidally restored marshes, but we observed strong differences across vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of microbial respiration and potential denitrification rates. Based on sea-level rise model projections, the replacement of S. patens by short-form S. alterniflora is expected to be widespread across the Connecticut coastline, decreasing statewide potential denitrification from the low-to-high marsh transitional zone. Our results suggest that changes in vegetation zones can serve as landscape-scale predictors of the rapid changes occurring in salt marshes. We sampled 20 polyhaline salt marshes (10 reference marshes with no history of restriction or restoration (i.e., ""reference sites""), 10 tidally restored)along the north shore of the Long Island Sound in Connecticut (CT), USA. Sites were selected based on their restoration history and presence of target vegetation: Spartinaalterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phagmitesaustralis.Within each vegetation zone at each site, we sampled three 1-m2 plotsin mid-August 2017. We visually estimated percent cover of all plants in each plot.From each plot we collected aboveground biomass (from a randomly selected 25 x 25 cm subplot) and three surface soil cores (5-cm diameter to 10-cm depth; 196-cm3 volume); sampleswere composited by zone and used to estimate above and belowground biomass (C and N content),bulk density, microbial process rates (denitrification potential, carbon mineralization, substrate induced respiration)and a suite of soil chemistry parameters using standarized methods (soil pH and specific electrical conductivity, soil moisture, total C and N, soil organic matter, carbon density,and soil SO42-, Cl-, NH4+ concentrations).

To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for 'blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.","10.1007/s10021-019-00373-x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330283","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072024527&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-019-00373-x&partnerID=40&md5=cdd95a8b2162a83abc202b894166f51b"

Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), ER (660.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), GEP (-2025.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD.

Composite samples at three depths (0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 cm) from each site were collected and characterized by solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The C-13 NMR spectral composition of three soil depths of the freshwater marsh was similar and dominated by contribution from polysaccharide carbon (C), followed by equal contributions from aliphatic C and total aromatic C. A steady and more pronounced drop in polysaccharide C with depth, accompanied by the demethoxylation of lignin moieties, was observed in the profiles of the saline marsh. The delta C-13 signature of these marsh soils suggested that much of the C in the saline profile was likely derived from the mixed debris of previous freshwater and saline marsh vegetation rather than from the current salt-tolerant Spartina species alone.

Infauna density and species richness (per 7.07 cm(2) core) achieved equivalence to comparable reference marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Taxa with dispersing larval stages (e.g. Streblospio benedicti, Capitella sp.) achieved equivalence within 3 yr following marsh creation. Taxa that lack a planktonic dispersal stage, such as tubificid oligochaetes and Manayunkia aesturina, were slower to develop. Densities of Manayunkia did not achieve equivalence to natural marshes until 8 yr after marsh creation. Twenty-five yr elapsed before oligochaete densities of constructed marshes were similar to natural marshes. In constructed marshes, densities of surface-deposit feeders, dominated by Streblospio and Manayunkia, achieved equivalence to natural marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Subsurface-deposit feeders, consisting mostly of oligochaetes, did not become equivalent to natural marshes for 25 yr. Predictable trajectories, described by an asymptotic increase over time, existed for total species, species richness, and surface- and subsurface-deposit feeders. Oligochaetes and Manayunkia, which produce non-dispersing larvae, exhibited linear trajectories over time. In constructed marshes, total density and density of dominant taxa and trophic groups were strongly correlated with soil characteristics, especially organic C, N, bulk density and macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat). Non-linear regressions using soil organic C and MOM explained 38 to 40% of the variation in constructed marsh infauna density. The regressions suggest that a threshold of 0.5% soil organic C (500 g m(-2), 0 to 10 cm) and 500 g MOM m(-2) (0 to 10 cm) is needed to support infauna densities comparable to densities found in natural marshes. Taxon richness of constructed marshes was more strongly related to vegetation characteristics, especially macro-organic matter quality (e.g. lignin) than soil characteristics. Development of benthic infauna communities following marsh construction requires longer than the 5 yr monitoring period required by many wetland mitigation plans, and as much as 25 yr are needed for some attributes (e.g. oligochaetes) to achieve equivalence.","10.3354/meps257045","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330290","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0041854449&doi=10.3354%2fmeps257045&partnerID=40&md5=1c0dc2f91728b7821ff7a4c1d2dc8b9f"

Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a pond's proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.","10.3389/feart.2019.00041","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330293","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064196675&doi=10.3389%2ffeart.2019.00041&partnerID=40&md5=e2dc45e15857cb1cba5d7b456122a07c"

Sampling was conducted at three restored salt marshes and six accidentally breached sites on the Essex coast, UK, providing a chronosequence from 16 to 114 years since restoration of tidal flow. Natural salt marsh at all sites were also sampled, along with adjacent fields on former salt marsh (where access permitted). All salt marsh sampling took place in October 2011. Field sample sites were sampled between July 2010 and April 2017. This data was collected as part of the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology's Multi-functional land-use options project (C03463) in order to determine the trajectory and timescale of habitat recovery, and provide empirically-based predictions of changes in the rate of carbon sequestration over time following saltmarsh restoration. Data is also represented for fields on former saltmarsh to give a 'before' time point to be able to calculate these changes. Three soil cores were taken at each sampling location using a soil corer measuring 4 centimetres (cm) in diameter and 30 cm in length. There were four sampling locations per salt marsh site, all taken from permanently vegetated marsh above 1.5 m ordnance datum (OD). The fields on former salt marsh had between 2 and 6 sampling sites situated away from field edges. All data derived from laboratory measurements. For each variable, standards were used and all laboratory equipment were calibrated in accordance with the laboratory practises at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Bangor.

Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast.

Two sites are located close to industrial areas. the salt marshes of the Odiel River and Bay of Cadiz, and one in a nonindustrial area, the Barbate River salt marshes. The Odiel River salt marshes also receive the drainage from mining activities in the Huelva region. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn were extracted from the residual fraction at percentages higher than 60%. In the sediments from the Odiel River salt marshes, concentrations of all the metals, except Cu, Zn, and Cd, exceeded 60% in the residual fraction as well. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Mn and Cd: in those from the Odiel River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Zn and Cd, respectively. The environmental risk was determined by employing the environmental risk factor (ERF), defined as ERF = (CSQV - Ci/CSQV), where Ci is the heavy metal concentration in the first four fractions and CSQV is concentration sediment quality value (the highest concentration with no associated biological effect). Our results showed that the sediments from the Cadiz Bay and Barbate River salt marshes do not constitute any environmental risk under the Current natural conditions. In contrast, in the Odiel River salt marshes. Cu. Zn. and Pb yielded ERFs of less than zero at several sampling stations and, consequently, pose a potential threat for the organisms in the area.

Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of C-org varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the C-org/N-tot ratio varied from 10 to 18.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.","10.3354/meps12282","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330314","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030544199&doi=10.3354%2fmeps12282&partnerID=40&md5=374b1357bf7a29c5f01bd88bfd2da3d6"

Living roots were distributed mainly in the upper 16 cm and concentrated at 4-10 an below the sediment surface. Pyrite accumulations were significantly different among the three types of sediment cores in the upper 16 an sediment and follow the descending order of DS (615 mu mol cm(-3)) > RKS (547 mu mol cm(-3)) > LS (368 mu mol cm(-3)). Between 20 cm and 30 an, pyrite contents approached values of 40 mu mol cm(-3) and 55 mu mol cm(-3) in all sediment cores. The degree of pyritization approaches 92-94% between 14 an and 20 an where pyrite accumulation was probably limited by available iron. Root distribution also affected the redistribution of iron through iron sulfide formation. Sulfate depletion in the upper 16 cm was higher in RKS (79.3 mu mol cm(-3)) than DS (49.1 mu mol cm(-3)). No significant sulfate depletion was found in LS. Sulfate reduction under DS was likely limited by the readily available substrates.

The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.","10.1111/rec.13300","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330319","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096713864&doi=10.1111%2frec.13300&partnerID=40&md5=c3a2a63e5c65058eade1222f6e46628e"

The carbon isotope composition of the bulk sediment and the HPLW parallel each other throughout most of the core, suggesting that terrestrial plants are an important source of organic matter to the sediments, and diagenetic alteration of the bulk sediments is minimal. The current salt marsh began to form 2500 cal yr BP. Low and/or high C-4 marsh plants dominated deposition at 2000 cal yr BP, 700 cal yr BP, and for the last 200 cal yr BP. Expansion of higher high marsh C-3 plants occurred at 1300 and 600 cal yr BP. These major vegetation shifts result from a combination of changes in relative sea-level rise and sediment accumulation rates.Average annual carbon sequestration rates for the last 2500 years approximate 40 g C yr(-1) m(-2), and are in strong agreement with other values published for the Gulf of Maine. Given that Maine salt marshes cover an area of similar to 79 km, they represent an important component of the terrestrial carbon sink.

The vertical distribution of sediment organic carbon and its relationship with S. alterniflora underground biomass was also examined. The results show that the total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant carbon (RC) and labile carbon (LC) contents were significantly greater in the surface sediments of the S. alterniflora flat, which showed different intra-annual variation trends compared to a bare flat. In particular, the majority of S. alterniflora-derived organic carbon was LC in the S. alterniflora flat sediments, indicating that the introduction of S. alterniflora resulted in a significant increase in surface sediment LC content. In addition, the results of S. alterniflora litter decomposition revealed a rapid decrease of 40% in the organic carbon stocks within the first 2 months, and the TOC and LC contents showed intra-annual variation trends similar to the surface litter mass but with a two-month ""phase difference"" in time. Further analysis indicated, S. alterniflora litter controlled the content and proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived TOC input, and it ultimately affected the TOC content variations in the sediments. However, due to the LC mainly originated from S. alterniflora, the surface litter exerted more significant impact on the variation of LC content. In the bare flat core, the relatively low TOC, RC and LC content values were significantly influenced by the grain control effect, and the origins of these components were mainly derived from non-S. alterniflora sources. However, in the S. alterniflora flat cores, the relationships between organic carbon content, grain size and underground biomass, together with the analysis of the organic carbon origins, indicated that the S. alterniflora underground biomass significantly affected the origin of organic carbon. In addition, Spartina alterniflora introduction significantly increased the carbon sequestration capacity of the tidal salt marsh in North Jiangsu. Furthermore, the TOC, LC and RC accumulation rate analyses also indicated that S. alterniflora introduction improved the salt marsh soil and was beneficial to long-term carbon sequestration of the organic carbon pool.

Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores.Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical and isotopic analyses included bulk parameters (TOC, TN, delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15(TN)), chlorophyll-a (Ch1-a), lipids (fatty acids, alcohols, and sterols) and lipid carbon isotopic compositions. Bulk parameters were apportioned with a three-end-member mixing model and biomarkers were processed using principal component analysis (PCA). The modeling indicated that OM from C3 terrestrial and marine sources dominate (> 80%) at most sediment sites during the two periods while C4 salt marsh plants contribute a large fraction (similar to 40%) of OM at one site during the low discharge period. The PCA demonstrated that more allochthonous OM deposits in the high discharge period while more autochthonous OM accumulates in the low discharge period; OM in the high discharge period is relatively fresh while that in the low discharge period is highly degraded. Distributions of bacteria-specific fatty acids in the estuarine sediments followed the same patterns as Ch1-a, algal lipids, and mixed lipids but were not correlated with terrestrial lipids, suggesting that the microbial community in the sediments depends largely on OM from phytoplankton rather than from terrestrial higher plants.

The soils of selected pedons were studied, and the soils were classified based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The soil pH values tended to be neutral due to the impact of seawater on the mangrove marsh. The amounts of organic carbon found in this study area were much less than those generally encountered in the wetland soils of temperate regions in the world. The base saturation percentages of the soils were almost 100%, the exchangeable Na being particularly predominant. The concentrations of various cations of water in this ecosystem were in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ = Ca2+, and those of anions of water were in the order of Cl-> SO42-> NO3- > PO43-. In spite of seasonal flooding changes, highly reduced states (100 to -200 mV of Eh values) existed throughout the two-year study. The spatial and temporal variations of the Eh values of the surface soil (0 - 20 cm) were higher than those of the subsoils (20 - 100 cm). The EC values of the soils from the surface to a depth of 100-cm were generally more than 20 dS/m.

Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.","10.1002/lno.10797","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330329","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051104990&doi=10.1002%2flno.10797&partnerID=40&md5=f467cdaa62630a06312a579ca8f317fa"

For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions and a lack of tidal influence, transformation of the former salt marsh to grassland resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were similar to those of the natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

We measured the amount of mercury accumulated over a 5-yr period from 1997 to 2002 in surface sediments of seven salt marshes along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay. The seven study sites extended from outer to inner Bay, spanning a gradient in tidal range (6-12 m) and sediment characteristics such as %LOI (4-29%) and sediment deposition rate (0.27-1.76 cm yr(-1)). In each study site, mercury was measured in low and high marsh areas. Sediment mercury concentrations ranged from 7 to 79 ng g(-1) and loading rates ranged from 0.1 to 1 mg m(-2). Total estimated 5-yr storage of mercury in salt marsh sediments of the Bay is 854 +/- 465 kg. We also compared sediment mercury loading to atmospheric inputs measured at a deposition monitoring station operating in New Brunswick from 1997 to 2002 and found that direct atmospheric deposition appears to be a minor input of mercury to these sediments.

In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence.

Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the ecological assembly and dynamics of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in such systems. Here, we employed two complementary methodological approaches (i.e., shotgun metagenomics and quantitative PCR) to examine the distribution and abundance of selected microbial genes involved in N transformations. We used soil samples collected along a well-established pristine salt marsh soil chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development at the island of Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands. Across the examined soil successional stages, the structure of the populations of genes involved in N cycling processes was strongly related to (shifts in the) soil nitrogen levels (i.e., NO3-, NH4+), salinity and pH (explaining 73.8% of the total variation, R-2 = 0.71). Quantification of the genes used as proxies for N fixation, nitrification and denitrification revealed clear successional signatures that corroborated the taxonomic assignments obtained by metagenomics. Notably, we found strong evidence for niche partitioning, as revealed by the abundance and distribution of marker genes for nitrification (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea) and denitrification (nitrite reductase nIrK, nirS and nitrous oxide reductase nosZ clades I and II). This was supported by a distinct correlation between these genes and soil physico-chemical properties, such as soil physical structure, pH, salinity, organic matter, total N. NO3-,NH4+ and SO42-, across four seasonal samplings. Overall, this study sheds light on the successional trajectories of microbial N cycle genes along a naturally developing salt marsh ecosystem. The data obtained serve as a foundation to guide the formulation of ecological models that aim to effectively monitor and manage pristine and impacted salt marsh areas. Such models should account for the ecology as well as the historical contingency of N cycling communities.","10.3389/fmicb.2016.00902","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330363","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84980010188&doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2016.00902&partnerID=40&md5=8ce3c97e0f605fa443819d0928485a2e"

The As concentrations in the pore water of the greenhouse experiment often significantly exceeded the Flemish soil sanitation thresholds for groundwater. There were indications that As release is not only affected by the reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, but also by e. g. a direct reduction of As(V) to As(III). Below the water table, sulfide precipitation seems to lower As mobility when reducing conditions have been sufficiently established.

Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.","10.1029/2021JG006507","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330367","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119843116&doi=10.1029%2f2021JG006507&partnerID=40&md5=5fbd9fdcff79d19e2b7c8f59e1ec1885"

Attributes related to biological productivity and diversity (Spartina, epiphytic and sediment algae, benthic invertebrates), soil development (sediment deposition, organic C, N, P, organic matter quality), and microbial processes (C mineralization) were compared among eight constructed marshes and eight paired natural reference marshes. Most ecological attributes developed in a predictable manner over time, and most achieved equivalence to natural marshes 5-15 yr after marsh construction. An exception was soil organic C and N pools (0-30 cm) that, after 28 yr, were significantly lower in constructed marshes. Development of habitat structure (Spartina stem height and density) and biodiversity (algae and invertebrates) developed concurrently with functional characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll a, and invertebrate density. Processes related to hydrology, sediment deposition and soil C and N accumulation, developed almost instantaneously with the establishment of Spartina, and young (1- to 3-yr-old), constructed marshes trapped sediment and sequestered N at higher rates than comparable reference marshes. Development of heterotrophic activity (C mineralization, invertebrate density) was strongly linked to surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C content. Ecosystem development of constructed (and natural) salt marshes depended on a minimum of 100 9 N/m(2) (0.05-0.1% N) to support emergent vegetation and 1000 g C/m(2) (0.5-1% C) to sustain the heterotrophic community.","10.1890/02-5086","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330373","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042311498&doi=10.1890%2f02-5086&partnerID=40&md5=0c706308c44b87e9a43b1b898cd00c0a"

Porewater physico-chemical properties (water level, temperature, salinity, dissolved O2, pH, redox potential (Eh), Fe, Mn) and nutrient (organic C, N, P, NH4, NO3, PO,) concentrations were monitored monthly for 1 yr in the two marshes. Soil nutrients (organic C, N, P), physical properties (bulk density, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity) and chemical characteristics (Eh, pH, Fe, Mn, Al) also were measured at the end of the study. 5 yr after emergent vegetation was established, the conversion from upland porewater and soil properties to typical wetland characteristics was incomplete. Dissolved O2, Eh, Fe, Mn and NO3-N were significantly higher in created marsh porewaters as compared to porewaters collected from the natural marsh. The created marsh also contained lower porewater dissolved organic C and N, NH4-N and PO4-P and had lower pH. Soil bulk density and extractable Fe were significantly higher, and porosity, hydraulic conductivity, pH, total organic C and N, and exchangeable NH4-N and NO3-N were lower in the created marsh than in the natural marsh soil.

Two groups of soils were specified. The first group includes saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group includes soils of tundra ecosystems, which are affected by the precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of Corg varies by horizons from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total - from 1 to 5 g/kg, the ratio of Corg/N total - from 10 to 18. In the middle part of the marsh soil profile, humus-accumulative horizons buried by recent marine sediments were recorded. In the second group, the content of C org is 430-470 g/kg, N total - 4-7g/kg. The Corg/N total ratio in the surface peat horizons equals 64-95 g/kg, and it decreases by 3-7 times with the depth. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded at each tide, more than any other soils, contain inorganic carbon, and their surface horizon < specifically. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varies between 4 and 20% of the total carbon content. Sea water and carbonate-containing rocks might be the source of the inorganic carbon. The correlation between the content of C org and N total in the soils and in plant communities growing on them was revealed. Obvious is the inflow of C org and N total into soil owing to birds and organic substances in sea waters.","10.1134/S0032180X19030092","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330382",NA

These ecosystem services have increased interest in the protection and restoration of marshes and soil properties and are an important consideration for successful restoration. This study was conducted in Indiana, USA, within the historical extent of the Grand Kankakee Marsh that once encompassed 202,343 ha, until the dredging of the Kankakee River from 1852 to 1917 to convert the marsh to cropland. Current (in 2019) soil properties (organic matter mass and concentration, bulk density, moisture content, and carbonate concentration) were compared between (1) marshes that were dredged and presently in other land-use categories such as cropland and forests, and (2) remnant marshes that were not impacted by dredging. On average, organic matter mass and concentration were not significantly different between dredged areas and marshes (p > 0.05). However, marshes tended to have lower bulk densities, greater moisture contents, and greater carbonate concentrations compared to dredged areas. The soil properties of remnant marshes in this study can be used to evaluate the success of marsh restoration efforts in regions with similar soils, climate, and land-use history.","10.1007/s13157-020-01347-9","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330383","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090765693&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-020-01347-9&partnerID=40&md5=4b96e6d4a04003f743002864afe28cdd"

Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes, whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China's Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased soil total organic C by 54.0% and total organic N by 73.2%, decreasing plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants' marsh. It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2% and 13.5%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 34.5% and 37.1%, respectively, in the Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment wall also significantly increased N2O emission by 48.9% in the Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2% in the Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections, whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2O were substantially different owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes' C and N sinks, potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China's wetlands. Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant expansion in coastal wetlands.","10.3390/su132212740","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330390","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119591973&doi=10.3390%2fsu132212740&partnerID=40&md5=63447b5619851df3e90bda66ecd8b188"

It was hypothesised that salt marsh plants and burrowing invertebrates could considerably affect the retention capacity of wetlands for metals through oxidation of the rhizosphere/burrow wall.Various soil, plant and porewater samples were collected from areas dominated by the plant species Spartina townsendii and Atriplex portulacoides and by the lugworm Arenicola marina, and from corresponding nearby unvegetated/uninhabited sites at North Bull Island salt marsh, Dublin Bay, Ireland. Samples were analysed for total Fe, Zn and As. The organic matter content (LOT), bulk density, water content and dry/fresh weight ratio of rhizosphere, burrow wall and bulk soil was measured for each species. DCB-extractable Fe, Zn and As, associated with the iron plaque on the roots of the two plant species were also determined.The presence of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, burrowing organisms were shown to have a significant effect on the concentration and accumulation of heavy metals in salt marsh soils. Iron and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher in vegetated/inhabited sails compared to nearby unvegetated/uninhabited areas. Zinc showed the same trend but the difference was not statistically significant. The concentrations of Fe and As were also significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil around the plant roots and in the burrow walls of Arenicola compared to the bulk soil. For zinc, the same pattern was significant only for S. townsendii-dominated soils. Atriplex stands appeared to have the greatest potential for heavy metal accumulation with concentrations reaching 1238 mu mol Fe g(-1), 4.9 mu mol Zn g(-1) and 512 nmol As g(-1) in the rhizosphere. The Zn/Fe ratio for S. townsendii and the As/Fe ratios for both plant species also increased from the bulk soil towards the roots. Concentrations of Zn and As appeared to correlate with both Fe concentrations and LOI values. However, covariation was significant only with Fe, indicating that it is the oxidation of Fe, rather than the binding to organic matter, that drives the accumulation of Zn and As. The amount of each element present in the various compartments associated with the plants (the sum of the element concentrations in the rhizosphere, ironplaque and roots) in I litre of the top 20 cm of soil, amounted to 0.84% for Fe, 3.6% for Zn and 2.8% for As for S. townsendii, and 12.5% for Fe, 19% for Zn and 18.3% for As for A. portulacoides. Densities of A. marina were never higher than 1 per litre of top sail so the small volume of burrow wall soil would therefore render that pool of negligible size compared to the rhizospheres of plants. It is likely that lugworms affect the movement of metals more importantly through bioturbation.

We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks.

This study investigates the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from New England salt marsh sediment seasonally and under possible expected drought conditions. Surface sediment total organic carbon (TOC) values shifted seasonally depending on the overlying dominant plant species suggesting that vegetation and inundation frequency and duration are key factors in sediment TOC fluctuations. Fall sediment samples leached more DOC than summer samples, were compositionally similar to the estuarine water column, and compositionally different from fresh plant matter. Thus, the seasonal TOC pulse incorporated into surface sediments could be a dominant source of DOC to the estuary in the fall and that summer contributions are presumed to be from upstream DOM sources based on optical properties. Sediments leached more DOC under drought than non-drought conditions due to induced cracking in the sediment enhancing organic matter degradation. This study suggests the majority of DOM exported laterally from salt marshes comes from surface sediments (versus plant matter) and that temperature and sea-level rise could affect seasonal and drought pulses of DOC from the marsh.","10.1007/s13157-019-01213-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330409","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076484284&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-019-01213-3&partnerID=40&md5=64c396d940aabbdc6bb025102e3ce640"

Group I represented coastal dunes and salt marshes GII: saline depressions, non-saline depressions, inland plateau and inland ridges and GIII: irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands. Coastal dunes had the highest species richness (a-diversity), followed by cultivated lands, while inland plateau had the lowest; but saline depressions had the highest species turnover (beta-diversity). Non-saline depressions had the highest relative evenness, while saline depressions had the highest relative concentration of dominance. Coastal dunes had highest values of calcium carbonates and calcium ions, and salt marshes had the highest salinity, pH, potassium and sodium contents, but cultivated lands had the highest values of silt, clay and organic matter. The diagram resulting from CCA showed an influence of most soil variables, except nitrogen, calcium and potassium. Twenty two species were recorded for the first time in the study area.

Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330423","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9"
"JOUR",14330430,"Bolduc, Francois; Afton, Alan D.","2005","Sediments in marsh ponds of the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain: effects of structural marsh management and salinity","Physical characteristics of sediments in coastal marsh ponds (flooded zones of marsh associated with little vegetation) have important ecological consequences because they determine compositions of benthic invertebrate communities, which in turn influence compositions of waterbird communities. Sediments in marsh ponds of the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain potentially are affected by (1) structural marsh management (levees, water control structures and impoundments; SMM), and (2) variation in salinity. Based on available literature concerning effects of SMM on sediments in emergent plant zones (zones of marsh occasionally flooded and associated with dense vegetation) of coastal marshes, we predicted that SMM would increase sediment carbon content and sediment hardness, and decrease oxygen penetration (O-2 depth) and the silt-clay fraction in marsh pond sediments. Assuming that freshwater marshes are more productive than are saline marshes, we also predicted that sediments of impounded freshwater marsh ponds would contain more carbon than those of impounded oligohaline and mesohaline marsh ponds, whereas C:N ratio, sediment hardness, silt-clay fraction, and O-2 depth would be similar among pond types. Accordingly, we measured sediment variables within ponds of impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, near Grand Chenier, Louisiana. To test the above predictions, we compared sediment variables (1) between ponds of impounded (IM) and unimpounded mesohaline marshes (UM), and (2) among ponds of impounded freshwater (IF), oligohaline (10), and mesohaline (IM) marshes. An a priori multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) contrast indicated that sediments differed between IM and UM marsh ponds. As predicted, the silt-clay fraction and O-2 depth were lower and carbon content, C:N ratio, and sediment hardness were higher in IM than in UM marsh ponds. An a priori MANOVA contrast also indicated that sediments differed among IF, 10, and IM marsh ponds. As predicted, carbon content was higher in IF marsh ponds than in ponds of other impounded marsh types. In contrast to our predictions, C:N ratio and sediment hardness were lowest and silt-clay fraction and O-2 depth were highest in 10 and IM marsh ponds. Our results indicated that SMM has affected physical properties of sediments in coastal marsh ponds. Moreover, sediments in IF marsh ponds were affected more so than were those in 10 and IM marsh ponds. Our results, in conjunction with those of previous studies, indicated that sediments of marsh ponds and emergent plant zones differed greatly. We predict that changes in pond sediments due to SMM will promote greater epifaunal macroinvertebrate biomass, which in turn should attract larger populations of wintering waterbirds. However, waterbirds that filter or probe soft sediments may be negatively affected by SMM because of the expected decrease in infaunal invertebrate biomass.","10.1007/s11273-004-0182-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330430","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26244463329&doi=10.1007%2fs11273-004-0182-y&partnerID=40&md5=0eb04c68f41ba4de0986273fbea1ac83"

Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.","10.1111/1365-2745.12571","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330433","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962537858&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2745.12571&partnerID=40&md5=48c28dacd9dcbd96acc54942480c13c1"

Key to ecosystem functioning is wetland response to sea-level rise through accumulation of mineral and organic sediment. The organic sediment within coastal wetlands is composed of carbon sequestered over the time scale of the wetland?s existence. This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring. Marsh surface elevations were measured at each site (ranging from 0.771 meters to 1.462 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the marsh boundaries within current tidal conditions. Continuous Rate of Supply age models, based on lead-210 and cesium-137 isotope analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Over that time, accretion rates were very similar for each ecosystem: restored marsh sites (2.5 mm per year), followed by the salt marshes (2.7 mm per year) and mature mangroves (3.2 mm per year). The resulting carbon burial rates over the past century vary as a function of vegetation type, with mature mangroves burying on average 163 grams carbon per square meter per year, compared to young (restoring) mangroves with an average of 94 grams carbon per square meter per year and the salt marsh with an average of 64 grams carbon per square meter per year . This dataset also includes dry bulk density (0.02 - 1.70 grams per cubic centimeter), percent carbon (0.32 %-39.08 %), and percent loss on ignition (0.66 % - 80.2 %) from a sub-set of core sections in order to assess possible correlative relationships among these parameters. https://estuaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FINAL_Tampa-Bay-Blue-Carbon-Assessment-Report-updated-compressed.pdf.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330440",NA

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.","10.1029/2004GB002261","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330451","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-15944399352&doi=10.1029%2f2004GB002261&partnerID=40&md5=fae68dafe54e03ecb3da99e1f779e483"

Tjeerd; Minden, Vanessa","2021","Hydrodynamics affect plant traits in estuarine ecotones with impact on carbon sequestration potentials","Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that play an important role in carbon fixing. The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream. Due to sea level rise, the area of estuarine vegetation may decrease because a fixed dike line along the river prevents landward migration, which can reduce the amount of biomass produced and with it the potential to store SOC. Restoration of the tidal marshes or realignment of the dikes may be necessary to protect the ecosystem properties and services of estuarine vegetation.","10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107464","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330454","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109199501&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107464&partnerID=40&md5=6d5df2c857219b2bf4e8a79ac5a7fb06"

Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi'ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi'ao Island.

Differentiating the diverse drivers of marsh loss is critical to prescribing successful interventions for conservation and restoration of this important habitat. We evaluated two hypotheses for vegetation loss at two marshes in Long Island Sound (LIS): (1) marsh submergence, caused by an imbalance between sea-level rise and marsh accretion, and (2) defoliation associated with herbivory by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum. At our western LIS site, we found no evidence of herbivory: crabs were scarce, and crab-exclusion cages provided no benefit. We attribute degradation at that site to submergence, a conclusion supported by topographic and hydrologic data showing that loss of vegetation occurred only in wetter parts of the marsh. In contrast, at our central LIS site, our observations were consistent with herbivory as a driving force: There were substantial populations of Sesarma, crab-exclusion cages allowed plants to thrive, and vegetation loss took place across a variety of elevations. We also analyzed soil conditions at both sites, in order to determine the signatures of different degradation processes and assess the potential for restoration. At the submergence site, unvegetated soils exhibited high bulk density, low organic content, and low soil strength, posing significant biogeochemical challenges to re-colonization by vegetation. At the herbivory site, unvegetated soils had a characteristic ""riddled-peat"" appearance, resulting from expansion and erosion of Sesarma burrow networks. The high redox potential and organic content of those soils suggested that revegetation at the herbivory site would be likely if Sesarma populations could be controlled before erosion leads to elevation loss.","10.1007/s12237-016-0080-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330461",NA

Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0-60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9 kg C/m(2) compared to 16.2 kg C/m(2) in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152 g/m(2)/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.","10.1007/s00267-015-0568-z","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330462","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940962398&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-015-0568-z&partnerID=40&md5=cc17350aab3de7b3bdf365b2f89c9f99"

Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a coastal adaptation strategy.","10.7717/peerj.11815","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330463",NA

However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220-250 g C m(-2) y(-1)), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m(-2) y(-1)). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the 16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions.","10.1371/journal.pone.0231713","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330465","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083737412&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0231713&partnerID=40&md5=8d90326918c11467695eb13ab328edb9"

Within the reclaimed area, two 250- x 20-m plots were treated as follows: (1) amendment with 25 Mg/ha of PG every 2 to 3 years between 1979 and 2003 (plot PY); (2) like PY but PG treatment stopped after 1997 (plot DR). A contiguous virgin Marisma salt-marsh plot (MV), neither drained nor amended, was the control. In MV, soil microbial biomass C, most enzyme activities and total organic C content were much greater than in PY and DR soils, despite the salinity stress. The decrease in soil organic matter content in PY and DR soils was likely due to cotton-cropping practices, which favoured the organic C mineralisation and nutrients removal by crops. Microbial activity of MV soil, probably stimulated by the rhizodepositions of the natural vegetation, did not suffer from the osmotic effect due to the raising of soil solution ionic strength. Microbial quotient could be ranked as MV > PY > DR, whereas the metabolic quotient had an opposite trend. Thus, both quotients suggested that the interruption of PG amendment was not favouring microbial activity. Principal component analysis clearly identified the chemical and biochemical soil properties mostly affected by the reclamation and also indicated the longer PG amendment in PY plot. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified two physiologically different types of soil microflora, one less active present in the MV virgin soil and another more active present in the reclaimed PY and DR soils.","10.1007/s00374-009-0380-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330466","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349986694&doi=10.1007%2fs00374-009-0380-0&partnerID=40&md5=2bc88a669566a934923016affa198866"

The characterisation of sediment samples shows a clear distinction between sites near and far from the Industrial Zone; no analogous pattern is observed for tissue concentrations suggesting that metal bioaccumulation is controlled by complex interactions between metal bioavailability and physiological factors. Considering relationships between metals, strong inverse correlations are observed in polychaetes and sediments for Cu and Cr concentrations suggesting a possible interaction between these two metals.

Groundwater exchange can flush sediment carbon to surface waters and potentially reduce storage. In this study, we estimated groundwater fluxes and associated carbon fluxes using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance and sediment carbon burial rates using lead (Pb-210) in a pristine salt marsh (North Inlet, SC, USA). We used delta C-13 to trace carbon origins. We found that groundwater releases large amounts of carbon to the open ocean. These groundwater fluxes have the potential to export 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 0.2 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 0.7 +/- 0.5 g m(-2) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per day. The fluxes exceed the average surface water CO2 emissions (0.6 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) day(-1)) and the average sediment carbon burial rates (0.17 +/- 0.09 g m(-2) day(-1)). The delta C-13 results suggest that groundwater carbon originated from salt marsh soils, while the sediment carbon source is derived from salt marsh vegetation. We propose that the impact of salt marshes in carbon cycling depends not only on their capacity to bury carbon in sediments, but also on their high potential to export carbon to the ocean via groundwater pathways.","10.1007/s12237-021-01021-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330481","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120444763&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-021-01021-1&partnerID=40&md5=b8be8cd5c9c025e93c4305a46b9cc40c"

The salt marsh has been unable to recover over the last 20 years because of the persistently high soil and groundwater salinity. In 2006, a 1 in 5 year flood occurred that completely covered the desertified salt marsh and floodplain with freshwater. The flood was followed by an above average (>45 mm) winter rainfall. Soil and groundwater sampled in April and August 2004 were compared with 2006 data to quantify the impact of the flood and rainfall event. It was hypothesised that the two freshwater events would significantly reduce the soil and groundwater salinity. However, the results showed no significant difference in sediment electrical conductivity throughout the soil profile over the four sampling periods. Soil moisture and organic content however increased significantly after these events in the surface soil layer. The flood deposited silt and scoured sand from the surface layers in significant quantities. The depth to groundwater in the desertified marsh retained a similar pattern after the flood despite 15 cm changes in depth in places. In 2004 a clear groundwater electrical conductivity gradient was present extending from the less saline north part of the marsh (0-15 mS cm(-1)) to the central part (120-135 mS cm(-1)) and decreasing again towards the south (60-75 mS cm(-1)). The flood served to even out the groundwater salinity across the desertified marsh (60-90 mS cm(-1)). The flood and high rainfall had a limited impact on the soil and groundwater characteristics. The few significant changes that were recorded were mostly restricted to the surface soil layers and on a small spatial scale. The rainfall did however create numerous pools of low salinity (<60 mS cm(-1)) water on the marsh surface that provided a brief opportunity for salt marsh seeds to germinate. A further benefit of the flood was the increased tidal reach into the desertified marsh importing freshwater from the river mouth and exporting salt. Despite these responses it is unlikely that the hypersaline salt marsh will revegetate naturally. Human intervention is needed to ensure the rehabilitation of this important Ramsar site.

Algae on both Spartina alterniflora and sediments (sediment algae) were collected in each marsh during spring and summer 1998 for assaying algal biomass (dry mass (DM), ash free dry mass (AFDM), chl a content, algal biovolume), algal species composition and diversity, and gross primary production. An attribute restoration ratio was calculated by dividing attribute values from each restored marsh by values from a paired reference marsh. Controlling for regional variation in reference marshes substantially increased precision in relations between attributes and the increase in age of restored marshes. The organic matter restoration ratio of sediments increased with age of restored marshes in both spring and summer. The algal biomass restoration ratios of epiphytes, calculated with algal biovolume and chl a, increased with restored marsh age in summer but not during spring. Biomass of sediment algae was not related to marsh age. The species diversity of sediment algae in summer showed an asymptotic relationship with sediment nutrient concentration. The similarity of diatom species composition between paired restored and reference sites increased with age of restored marshes during spring and summer. Primary production by epiphytic and sediment algae in summer showed site-specific changes and did not change consistently with marsh age. Algal biomass, algal diversity, and diatom species composition during summer were positively correlated with sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. We concluded that other structural and functional development of restored wetlands, especially nutrient storage in sediments, regulates algal species composition and algal biomass accumulation, which can be used to evaluate salt marsh restoration.","10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0309:CIBAAD]2.0.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330494","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-25144458386&doi=10.1672%2f0277-5212%282004%29024%5b0309%3aCIBAAD%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=915588973c4144940946ca8abb3e26f8"

Denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria contributed 15 and 18% to total sediment C and O cycling, respectively. C, N, and O-2 cycling rates were limited by both temperature and the availability of labile organic matter. Muddy sediment C content was twice that of sandy sediments, but was half as labile, resulting in similar mean metabolic rates between sediment types (mean muddy and sandy O-2 consumption rates were 62 and 58 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively; CO2 production was 58 and 46 mmol m(-2) d(-1); and D-n was 5.4 and 4.9 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)).

Annually, D-n accounted for 72% of total denitrification, with the remainder accounted for by water column-supported denitrification.

We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests.

We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of similar to 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger OC stocks (175-504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44-271 Mg/ha).

Elevated nitrogen contents in humus samples suggest nitrogen incorporation during humification is most extensive in forest soils relative to the marsh sites. The lignin compositions of the macro-organic and humus samples reflect the predominant type of vegetation at each site. Lignin phenol ratios indicate that woody and nonwoody litter from gymnosperm and angiosperms trees (pines and oaks) is the major source of vascular plant-derived organic matter in the forest site and that angiosperm grasses (Juncus and Spartina) are the major sources of lignin at the marsh sites. The phenol distributions also reveal that oxidative degradation of Lignin is most extensive in the forest and brackish marsh zones whereas little Lignin decay occurs in the salt marsh samples. In forest soils, most organic matter originates From highly altered forest vegetation while at the brackish marsh site organic matter is a mixture of degraded Juncus materials and microbial/algal remains.

Twenty stations were sampled along a salinity and environmental gradient, from the inner to the outer bay, to provide a first characterization of sediment distribution along the tidal flats. Paranagua Bay was then divided into three different sectors according to the hydrodynamic regime and sediment characteristics. The mesohaline sector is characterized by typically fluid sediments, with the predominance of medium silt, and high organic and water contents. Deposits of the middle polyhaline sector are poorly sorted, very fine sands, with variable organic matter content. Sediments in the higher-energy euhaline sector are well-sorted fine sands, with lent organic content. Four sampling sites were chosen in different sectors to assess whether S. alterniflora marshes can introduce differences in sediment texture along spatial and seasonal gradients. Differences in sediment parameters between marshes and unvegetated tidal flats are not evident in the inner sector, but are increasingly significant towards the high-energy euhaline sector. With the exception of water and organic content, the latter usually higher in summer, seasonal differences in sediment parameters are not significant. The results suggest that differences between the sediments of salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated tidal flats are positively correlated with the environmental energy gradient along Paranagua Bay. Sand unavailability and high sedimentation rates lead to a marked sedimentological homogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated flats in the upper reaches of the bay. On the other hand, S. alterniflora is a major source of sediment heterogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated sites in the high-energy euhaline sector, characterized by more mature sediments.

Salt marshes, like other coastal marine environments, are limited by nutrients, mainly nitrogen, and thus increasing nutrient loadings to a marsh may have consequences on marsh characteristics. We evaluated how the effects of nutrient enrichment in the form of sewage input, affected the vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh system near Bahia Blanca, Argentina (39 degrees 01' S - 56 degrees 25' W). Surveys of nutrient concentration, vegetation and birds were made at three different distances from the sewage discharge source. The concentration of ammonium, phosphate, and nitrate and the percent organic matter was higher in marshes nearest to the sewage discharge source. Bird composition and abundance, and vegetation physiognomy changed along a gradient of nutrient concentration. The increased habitat complexity found near the areas of higher nutrient concentration was exploited by birds that use neighboring interior and coastal habitats, including Spartina densiflora marshes, freshwater marshes and upland shrubby habitats. Our results show that local increases of nutrient inputs directly changed the vegetation physiognomy, and indirectly the composition and abundance of bird assemblages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The vegetative component of artificially established salt marshes has been examined in several studies, but relatively little is known about the other aspects of these systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the infaunal community of artificially established salt marshes. Infauna were sampled from pairs of artificially established (AE) salt marshes and nearby natural marshes at six sites along the North Carolina coast. The AE marshes ranged in age from 1 yr to 17 yr. Total infaunal density, density of dominant taxa, and community trophic structure (proportions of subsurface-deposit feeders, surface-deposit and suspension feeders, and carnivores) were compared between the two types of marsh to assess infaunal community development in AE marshes. Overall, the two marsh types had similar component organisms and proportions of trophic groups, but total density and densities within trophic groupings were lower in the AE marshes. Soil organic matter content of the natural marshes was nearly twice that of the AE marshes, and is a possible cause for the higher infaunal densities observed in the natural marshes. Using the same three criteria, comparisons of the natural and AE marshes at each of the six locations revealed varying degrees of similarity. Similarity of each AE marsh to its natural marsh control appeared to be influenced by differences in environmental factors between locations more than by AE marsh age. Functional infaunal habitat convergence of an AE marsh with a natural marsh somewhere within its biogeographical region is probable, but success in duplicating the infaunal community of a particular natural marsh is contingent upon the developmental age of the natural marsh and the presence and interaction of site-specific factors.","10.2307/1352678","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330523","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028161373&doi=10.2307%2f1352678&partnerID=40&md5=be42d396981d3b7418b53aec6fa336ee"

Expressed on a surface area basis, labile C and SO42- were both significantly correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.36). Lower CH, production rates in saline marshes were attributed to higher SO42- content per unit area. This effect was confounded with the effect of plant species changes along the salinity gradient. Soils under Spartina patens produced less CH4 if collected from brackish marshes than from less saline intermediate marshes. Thus, variation in CH4 production across the broader gradient was not a result of plant species changes alone.

Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1).

Within a salt marsh area along the Canche Estuary (northern France), four transects were sampled to see the effects of maximal tidal constraints (shore transects) and minimal tidal constraints (alongshore transects). Multivariate analyses have been performed to determine the correlations between biotic (foraminiferal absolute abundances) and abiotic factors (elevation, grain-size, TOC and total sulphur). For each of the principal benthic foraminiferal species the tolerance to subaerial exposure have been estimated as well. Two distinctive foraminiferal zones have been identified along the vertical tidal gradient: a zone I in the higher part of the salt marsh dominated by agglutinated and porcelaneous taxa, and a zone II in the lower one dominated by hyaline specimens. Hyper tidal exposure constraints the foraminiferal vertical zonation in accordance with the tidal frame. However it does not constitute a threshold parameter able by itself to explain all the faunal variations in the Canche Estuary.

This often results from sites being too low in the tidal frame and/or poorly drained with anoxic sediments. A managed coastal realignment scheme at Abbotts Hall, Essex, UK, has oxic sediments at elevations at which upper marsh communities would be expected. But 7 years after flooding, it continued to be dominated by pioneer communities, with substantial proportions of bare ground, so other factors must hinder vegetation development at these elevations. The poorly vegetated areas had high sediment shear strength, low water and organic carbon content and very flat topography. These characteristics occur frequently on the upper parts of created marshes. Experimental work is required to establish causal links with the ecological differences, but other studies have also reported that reduced plant beta-diversity and lower usage by fish are associated with topographic uniformity. Uniformity also leads to very different visual appearance from natural marshes. On the upper intertidal, sediment deposition rate are slow, water velocities are low and erosive forces are weak. So, topographic heterogeneity cannot develop naturally, even if creeks have been excavated. Without active management, these conditions will persist indefinitely.","10.1007/s12237-014-9824-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330541","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939893848&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-014-9824-3&partnerID=40&md5=6267a6eb396c66b47f66f8c462db01ee"

We used piezometer networks to evaluate the in situ groundwater denitrification capacity and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux (with N-15-enriched nitrate-N via the push-pull method) in four former fringing salt marshes topped by HTM along the Rhode Island coast, U.S.A. Groundwater at these sites commonly interacted with the buried marsh horizon and the HTM. In situ groundwater denitrification capacity site means ranged from 15.2 to 71.7 mu g N kg(-1)d(-1) with no significant differences between sites due to high intrasite variability. The site with the highest and most consistent denitrification capacity also had HTM of the finest texture and highest soluble organic carbon. Three of four sites had minimal N2O flux [mean N2O:(N2O + N-2) = 0.082] while the final site had N2O generation rates up to 52.5 mu g N kg(-1) d(-1). The site with the highest N2O contributions also had the lowest ambient groundwater nitrate-N indicating lack of priming for N2O reduction to N-2. Former salt marshes with HTM deposits may still have the capacity for substantial groundwater denitrification capacity, similar to that observed in undisturbed salt marshes, but may also contribute substantially to global N2O emissions. For both salt marsh restoration and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, attention should be given to ensuring that a tidally-driven, fluctuating water table regularly intercepts the buried organic horizons of the filled salt marsh.","10.1007/s11252-012-0266-z","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330549","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877019123&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-012-0266-z&partnerID=40&md5=a81751a9ceeaa4ab6fe8ae04cc3195e2"

Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment into Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (i.e., root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (i.e., carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground tissues compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

To develop palynomorph signatures and calibrate soil C-N ratios for boreal wetlands we sampled low and high elevation tidal marshes, fens and bogs along eastern James Bay, Canada. A discriminant analysis model showed that a small subset of palynomorph taxa can effectively discriminate between the four wetland types. Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Potamogeton-Triglochin-type are important to the classification of high marshes. Bryidae spores and pollen of Myrica gale, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae are indicative of fen. Moss spores alone, primarily from Sphagnum, but also Bryidae type spores, derived from brown mosses are the indicators of bog. The use of palynomorph assemblages to discriminate among wetland types is not dependent upon the localized presence of a plant source as it would be using macrofossil analysis. C/N of bog soils can be clearly distinguished from fen and tidal marshes and can be used as a pollen-independent proxy to indicate fen to bog wetland succession. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Nitrogen, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg concentrations and C/N ratios were determined in both vegetation and soil. Differences between management groups were evaluated.Results: Comparison among different management groups revealed several differences in both relative and total amount of nutrients in soil and vegetation. Most soil properties of restored sites were similar to those in abandoned sites. Carbon stock in the soil profile doubled after abandonment, total N concentration in the top soil layer increased while plant available P concentration decreased. The phytomass and chemical composition of phytomass rapidly changed back to a 'normal' level after restoration. Species composition remained different, but species typical of coastal grasslands were present in restored sites. There was a strong site specificity in the results.Conclusions: Re-establishment of grazing had a rapid impact on plant biomass of coastal grasslands. Species composition responded more slowly, but target species returned relatively quickly. Slow recovery of soil properties, however, means that the results of restoration may be fragile and return of tall-growth vegetation is very probable if managent intensity declines.

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.","10.1038/s41586-019-0951-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330569","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062585818&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-019-0951-7&partnerID=40&md5=4b44efb7fab903f4cd8991016a2c167d"

In this study, coastal marsh soil profiles of two contrasting basins were investigated for lignin composition in order to assess organic matter source and degradation status under these different wetland formations. The Atchafalaya Basin is undergoing land building whereas the Barataria Basin is experiencing land loss. Lignin monomers were extracted using alkaline CuO oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Marsh soil profiles from the Barataria Basin showed strong lignin storage with two-fold higher lignin contents (sum of vanillyl, syringyl, and cinnamyl phenols, A(8)) than those in the Atchafalaya Basin. Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

Multivariate comparisons of the planktonic community profiles revealed that the 2 estuaries supported distinct bacterial communities. Furthermore, bacterial communities in both systems were partitioned into separate particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) components. Differences in bacterial populations were also observed along the salinity gradient within each system. Comparisons of water physicochemistry with bacterial profiles indicated significant correlation of PA bacterial community structures with temperature, salinity, organic carbon, total phosphorus, and ammonium, whereas FL communities were affected by nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus and orthophosphate. PA bacterioplankton community structures were also associated with diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes and cryptophytes, while FL assemblages corresponded to prasinophytes, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria.

To improve mechanistic understanding, we assess how net carbon storage is influenced by interactions between crab activity, water movement, and biogeochemistry. We show that crab burrows enhance carbon loss from tidal marsh sediments by physical and chemical feedback processes. Burrows increase near-creek sediment permeability in the summer by an order of magnitude compared to the winter crab dormancy period, promoting carbon-rich fluid exchange between the marsh and creek. Burrows also enhance vertical exchange by increasing the depth of the strongly carbon-oxidizing zone and reducing the capacity for carbon sequestration. Results reveal the mechanism through which crab burrows mediate the movement of carbon through tidal wetlands and highlight the importance of considering burrowing activity when making budget projections across temporal and spatial scales.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab60e2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330576","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080040556&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fab60e2&partnerID=40&md5=4d3565a225e5a9bd78052e598630606b"

Surface and pore waters were sampled four times a year between 2008 and 2010 and sediment cores were collected yearly in the constructed marsh and once in 2010 in the natural marsh. Interactions of trace metals with redox active species such as iron and sulfide as well as with organic matter were investigated. Precipitation with sulfides played a major role in immobilizing certain trace metals, including Cr, Mn, and Pb. At both sites, the presence of sulfide did not preclude the presence of dissolved trace metals in pore-water at concentrations exceeding their metal sulfide solubility product. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling indicated these dissolved metals remained in solution due to an association with heterogeneous dissolved organic carbon. No net trace metal accumulation in the surficial sediments of the constructed marsh was noted between 2007 and 2010. This implied that a dynamic equilibrium of trace metal flux into and out of the sediments was established, rather than a long-term net accumulation of trace metals. In the constructed marsh, little difference was found between the immobilization potential in the area of intermittent flooding (high marsh) and the area of sustained flooding (low marsh). The newly constructed wetland immobilized significantly more Cr, Mn, and Zn than the natural marsh and similar concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Pb. This may be due to increased redox buffering through a larger FeS buffering pool against tidally induced oxygen delivery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The records from these cores include a suite of elements, organic carbon content, fossil seeds, pollen, and stable carbon isotopes. The stratigraphy indicates fresher water conditions than present between 3400 and 2000 cal YBP. A tidal marsh became established at China Camp after about 2000 cal YBP: between 2000 cal YBP and approximately 700 cal YBP, conditions in the estuary were apparently more saline and variable. This interval was terminated by at least three or possibly five flood events, as evidenced by coarse elastic materials most likely washed down from the surrounding uplands. These floods represent high rainfall events, possibly El Nino years, and occurred during the late Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Greater plant diversity and pollen from some species with low salt tolerance are found in a core collected near the upland edge of the marsh and date to about 200 years ago, suggesting fresher conditions than today. Over the past 50 years, the diversity of marsh vegetation has decreased, and salt tolerant plants (especially Salicornia virginica) have become the dominant species.

Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr(-1), a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget.","10.1029/2020JG005832","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330582","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103233334&doi=10.1029%2f2020JG005832&partnerID=40&md5=a5c25433c8600e05926f5a73870de7ad"

While the role of plants in determining the capacity of salt marshes to keep pace with SLR through sediment accretion has received considerable attention, the role of microbes in offsetting these gains via decomposition is less understood.We conducted a controlled experiment to determine the structural and functional responses of microbes to SLR, using soil from the low intertidal zone of two New England salt marshes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, USA. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (t-RFLPs) generated from microbial 16S rDNA to evaluate community composition and diversity and focused on changes in respiration with SLR, measured as total respired carbon normalized by percent organic matter, as a surrogate for decomposition rate.We observed a 24% reduction in microbial respiration with a simulated rise in sea level of 40 cm. This functional change was accompanied by a structural shift in microbial community composition among samples from New Hampshire but not Massachusetts, assessed via principal coordinate analysis of t-RFLP data. We also found greater microbial diversity within our New Hampshire samples, suggesting that low diversity may constrain community compositional shifts.Our results suggest that decreased microbial respiration could alleviate the negative effects of SLR on salt marsh surface elevation, at least in the short term, and that the diversity of the soil microbial community may positively influence functional responses such as respiration.","10.1007/s11368-017-1710-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330583","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017475577&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-017-1710-8&partnerID=40&md5=a122c34fe8398dba0548b779ee4509c6"

This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.","10.1007/s12237-017-0362-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330585","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039866198&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-017-0362-7&partnerID=40&md5=e99451cc4a55cb3dba759112a13f7ab0"

It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity. Diversity effects are more pronounced in biogeographical contexts where soils are erosion-prone (sandy, low organic content), suggesting that the pervasive influence of biodiversity on environmental processes also applies to the ecosystem service of erosion protection.","10.1111/jvs.12367","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330592","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958120537&doi=10.1111%2fjvs.12367&partnerID=40&md5=e370bba910ad741ee2ba43330202e4a9"

Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context.

We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community.

In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.","10.3354/meps11447","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330607","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944345360&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11447&partnerID=40&md5=1a65ee2c699aa61d133ef331b5041bec"

Sampling was conducted at eight sites along a range of tidal magnitudes (< 2 to >14 m). Cluster analysis revealed seven distinct salt or brackish marsh plant associations, usually dominated by a single graminoid species. Redundancy analysis showed continuous variation among community units and identified inundation time, elevation, soil salinity, and organic matter content as key correlates of plant community patterns. Associations detected were similar to those found in New Brunswick's Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait wetlands, and to those farther south in northern New England, but two new brackish associations were also identified within this study (Juncus balticus Willd. - Festuca rubra L. and Spartina pectinata Link). Although elevation is understood to drive vegetation types in salt marshes in the region, here we show that salinity can differentiate vegetation types at the same elevation.

Concentrations of these metals were also analysed in above- and belowground parts of Spartina maritima, as well as in sediments colonised by the plant. The highest metal concentrations in sediments were found in the marshes near the industrial and urban areas, whereas metal concentrations in plants were not significantly different among sites. This was thought to be a consequence of differences observed in metal bioavailability: Metals in Pancas, the least polluted location, were largely associated to easily accessible fractions for plant uptake, probably as a result of low organic matter content and high sandy fraction in sediments. S. maritima was able to induce the concentration of metals between its roots in the three salt marshes. The results obtained in this study indicate that S. maritima could be useful to induce phytostabilisation of metals in sediments, although the effectiveness to modify chemical associations is highly dependent on existing sediment parameters, and thus different results could be obtained depending on site characteristics.","10.1007/s10750-008-9340-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330615","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149140025&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-008-9340-1&partnerID=40&md5=6fab3dcea7c414f6bd8b9ae65162fb4e"

Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora from the BBE is efficient in accumulating some metals, despite usually low metal concentrations in sediments and plants. This accumulation capacity has implications for the whole system through the fate of the tissues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Reducing the current uncertainty on the amount of OC stored these sediments requires the analysis of a large number of sediment samples. Soil sensing techniques, using mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been proven to be a valid alternative for standard OC measurements in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the application of these techniques to tidal marsh sediments has been very limited and the error associated with calculated sedimentary OC stocks using MIR spectroscopy/PLSR data has up till now not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the potential of MIR spectroscopy/PLSR to predict the OC concentration and OC stock of tidal marsh sediments in a temperate estuary (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and The Netherlands). Based on a cross -validation procedure, the results show that MIR spectroscopy/PLSR predicts the OC concentration of tidal marsh sediments along the entire estuary with a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.56% OC). Similar accuracies were obtained for the prediction of sedimentary OC concentrations from independent tidal marshes. Organic carbon concentrations from tidal marshes in the salt portion of the estuary were, however, predicted more accurately using a PLSR model trained exclusively with sediment samples from this salinity zone. Combining depth profiles of predicted OC concentrations with measured bulk densities resulted in predictions of total OC stocks with a relative error < 4% for freshwater and brackish marshes, while errors for salt marshes were up to 30%. As MIR spectroscopy/PLSR is not able to accurately predict bulk density or OC density, standard field measurements of bulk density remain necessary to reliably predict sedimentary OC stocks in tidal marshes.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.051","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330622","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054596541&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.09.051&partnerID=40&md5=6e5871354dd3ddd37dfcc8f0cc5bfae9"

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330630","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107433584&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107875&partnerID=40&md5=c57f77f001595b38968fd0652dc8bd4f"

Therefore, the current study aims to quantify the organic carbon stocks in the salt marsh habitats on the Northwest coast of Sri Lanka and to showcase the relevance of salt marsh carbon in local and regional contexts. Vegetation and soil up to a depth of 50 cm were sampled from four sites representing the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve (WNR).

A field experiment in a newly excavated mitigation site examined the effects of adding ammonium sulfate (N), nitrogen-rich alfalfa (with or without added N), and nitrogen-poor straw (with or without added N) prior to planting. Aboveground biomass and stem densities of cordgrass were proportional to the amount of N added, whether in the organic or inorganic form. Alfalfa decomposed more rapidly than straw, but in both cases, N was lost quickly (50-66% in 2 wk). Sediment nitrogen and carbon pools were not increased significantly by the amendments. High decomposition rates and sandy soils apparently prevented accumulation of N in the nutrient and/or organic matter pools. Less than 5% of the nitrogen potentially available for uptake was actually recovered in aerial tissue. With N-poor soil and high nutrient-loss rates, the experimental plots developed less than half the aboveground biomass found in reference natural cordgrass marshes.

Litter production, the rate of soil surface accretion and shallow soil subsidence were all higher in grazed compared to unrated plots, while soil organic matter and bulk density did not differ significantly between treatments.4 The results indicate that herbivores can have a negative effect on soil building processes, primarily by reducing below-ground production and expansion of the root zone.

Those trace metals commonly associated with urban and industrial sources, including Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg, were in significantly higher concentrations in tidal creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds compared to the suburban and forested watersheds. Sediment trace metal concentrations were similar for creeks located in suburban and forested watersheds and 2 to 10 times lower than the creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds. Concentrations of trace metals primarily associated with the natural weathering of basement rock, including Al, Fe, As, Ni, and Mn, were not significantly different among watershed types. Four of the tidal creek-salt marsh systems were extensively sampled from the creek channel to the marsh-upland interface to characterize sediment trace metal spatial distributions within creek-marsh systems. Sediment particle size, TOC, and trace metal concentrations varied spatially within each creek-marsh system depending on the type of development in the watershed and the probable source of metals.

In this study, we use a combination of stable isotope analyses and macrofauna community analysis to compare the ecological structure and function between a recently constructed Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and a natural reference habitat over a 2-year period. The restored marsh was successful in providing habitat for economically and ecologically important macrofauna taxa; supporting similar or greater density, biomass, and species richness to the natural reference during all but one sampling period. Stable isotope analyses revealed that communities from the natural and the restored marshes relied on a similar diversity of food resources and that decapods had similar trophic levels. However, some generalist consumers (Palaemonetes spp. and Penaeus aztecus) were more 13C-enriched in the natural marsh, indicating a greater use of macrophyte derived organic matter relative to restored marsh counterparts. This difference was attributed to the higher quantities of macrophyte detritus and organic carbon in natural marsh sediments. Reduced marsh flooding frequency was associated with a reduction in macrofaunal biomass and decapod trophic levels. The restored marsh edge occurred at lower elevations than natural marsh edge, apparently due to reduced fetch and wind-wave exposure provided by the protective berm structures. The lower elevation of the restored marsh edge mitigated negative impacts in sampling periods with low tidal elevations that affected the natural marsh. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering sediment characteristics and elevation in salt marsh constructions.

We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using Cs-137 and Pb-210 downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0.2-0.5 cm year(-1), indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on Pb-210 dating was 79 g C m(-2) year(-1), with slightly higher rates based on Cs-137 dating.

We report measurements of pore fluid and sediment geochemistry, coupled with results from laboratory sediment incubation experiments, and develop a conceptual model to describe the influence of bioturbation on subsurface redox cycling. In the studied sediments the subsurface environment falls into two broadly defined geochemical patterns - iron-rich sediments or sulfide-rich sediments. Within each sediment type nearly identical pore fluid and solid phase geochemistry (in terms of concentrations of iron, sulfate, sulfide, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate) are observed in sediments that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Strictly iron-rich and strictly sulfide-rich sediments, despite their substantive geochemical differences, are observed within spatial distances of less than five meters. We suggest that this bistable system results from a series of feedback reactions that determine ultimately whether sediments will be sulfide-rich or iron-rich. We suggest that an oxidative cycle in the iron-rich sediment, driven by bioirrigation, allows rapid oxidation of organic matter, and that this irrigation impacts the sediment below the immediate physical depth of bioturbation. This oxidative cycle yields iron-rich sediments with low total organic carbon, dominated by microbial iron reduction and no methane production. In the absence of bioirrigation, sediments in the salt marsh become sulfide-rich with high methane concentrations. Our results suggest that the impact of bioirrigation not only drives recycling of sedimentary material but plays a key role in sedimentary interactions among iron, sulfur and carbon.","10.3389/feart.2019.00140","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330657","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068469550&doi=10.3389%2ffeart.2019.00140&partnerID=40&md5=d6f41afdbb8945b517479e9c18fcd165"

Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37 % (113 ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63 % (196 ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55 % (169 ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (< 5.5 %), with mean bulk densities of 0.58 g cm(-3), indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.","10.1007/s12237-013-9725-x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330658","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901984314&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-013-9725-x&partnerID=40&md5=0c21b313f67f05787c4a232e7247e17d"

Today a lack of knowledge about sedimentological parameters prevent for a predicated discussion on their adaptation capacity to recent and future sea-level changes. A combined field and laboratory method to calculate marshland accretion rates based on short-term (2010-2013) measurements of sediment depositions was developed. All studies were carried out at the marshlands of the Halligen Hooge, Langeness and Nordstrandischmoor. One litre LDPE bottles and small synthetic turf mats were used as simple but coast, time and quantity efficient sediment trap devices. Up to a deposition rate, of approximate to 2.0 kg/m(2), both devices gained comparable results. Above this threshold the retention efficiency of the turf mats is decreasing compared to the LDPD bottles. The combined use of bottles and mats, especially when deposition rates are not exceeding the threshold, allows to (1) checking internal consistency of the data, (2) detecting outliers with respect to cattle- or man-made damage, and (3) estimating possible effects of post-storm sediment remobilization. To transfer sediment depositions into rates of vertical accretion, the bulk dry density as well as the organic matter concentration of the correspondent marsh soil was considered using data from shallow percussion cores. These parameters are different among all Halligen. Higher inundation frequencies cause lower soil organic matter concentrations, resulting in higher bulk dry densities (BDD) of the soil (Hooge 0.64 g/cm(3), Langeness 0.67 g/cm(3), Nordstrandischmoor 0.83 g/cm(3)). Autochthonous organic material (by source of the marshland vegetation) contributes by 9.0 +/- 1.4 % (Hooge) to 21.4 +/- 6.6 % (Nordstrandischmoor) to marshland accretion, for a correspondent time scale of 1915-2011. Average accretion rates (2010-2013) were calculated with 1.2 +/- 0.8 mm/a for Langeness, 1.5 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Hooge and 2.6 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Nordstrandischmoor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine if episodic marsh impoundments could be partially responsible for the observed cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) dieback at Crissy Field, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, we examined sulfur chemistry and plant stress along transects between and during tidal inlet closure events from 2007 to 2008. During closures, porewater sulfide (PW S2-) concentrations did not respond consistently among sites, nor did they increase to levels likely to cause stress damage to cordgrass (>1 mM). However, sediment solid-phase total reduced sulfur (TRS) concentrations did respond strongly to closures both at surface and subsurface depth intervals, and they were greatest in sites with high organic matter content (>5%). The temporal patterns of both PW S2- and TRS suggest that while sulfate reduction may be enhanced during closure events, the free sulfide produced is largely precipitated into solid-phase minerals. Even without millimolar levels of PW S2-, plant stress was observed during closures, as indicated by a buildup of ethanol in root tissues, a by-product of fermentative respiration brought on by limited oxygen availability. Further, enhanced sulfate reduction may be related to the higher relative concentrations of methylmercury in low intertidal surface sediments observed during closure events. These data suggest that, in support of vegetated tidal marsh restoration goals, tidal flows should be maintained actively to reduce the impact of impoundment events on marsh biogeochemistry and productivity.","10.1111/j.1526-100X.2011.00849.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330668","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872686857&doi=10.1111%2fj.1526-100X.2011.00849.x&partnerID=40&md5=45bafaca23f780692da171498bdda573"

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel.

(PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.","10.1007/s11104-019-04184-w","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330669","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068345721&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-019-04184-w&partnerID=40&md5=ef8141da46ef38599b2acb312020dbd7"

Community composition and DEA were highly variable within the dynamic salt marsh system, but each was strongly affected by elevation (i.e., degree of inundation) and carbon content as well as by selected metals. Carbon content was highly related to elevation, and the relationships between DEA and carbon content were found to be elevation specific when evaluated across the entire marsh. There were also lateral gradients in the marsh, as evidenced by an even stronger association between community composition and elevation for a marsh subsystem.

The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes.

"JOUR",14330681,"Ward, L.G.; Kearney, M.S.; Stevenson, J.C.","1998","Variations in sedimentary environments and accretionary patterns in estuarine marshes undergoing rapid submergence, Chesapeake Bay","Major processes controlling sedimentological characteristics and accretionary rates and patterns were evaluated in two of the most common tidal marsh settings (estuarine tributaries and estuarine embayments) in Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest microtidal estuaries in the world. Textural analyses of 29 vibracores show spatial and temporal trends in grain size and organic matter which reflect differences in depositional settings within the marshes and changes in the controlling processes, as well as broader events in the surrounding watersheds. Spatially, the surficial sediments normally follow expected patterns, with coarsest sediments and lowest organic matter contents found in bay margin or channel margin locations, while the finest, organic-rich sediments occur in interior and submerged upland marshes. However, temporally, the marshes do not always show the expected increasing dominance of organic input over time (indicated by increasing % loss on ignition with decreasing depth), indicative of the marsh building process. Sea-level rise, tidal channel migrations, and anthropogenic effects likely contribute to decreases in organic matter contents in the upper sediment column. Furthermore, accretion rates and stratigraphic characteristics can be affected by these same processes, illustrating the importance of understanding temporal changes in marsh depositional environments over various time scales before sedimentologic and accretionary patterns are evaluated. Examination of the vibracores reveals that the marsh is composed of a complex stratigraphy with at least four major stratigraphic sequences occurring: (1) emerging or developing marsh sequences characteristic of channel margin and interior marshes; (2) submerging or mineral matter enriched marshes, also characteristic of channel and interior marsh areas; (3) high-energy marsh sequences characteristic of bay margin environments; and (4) submerged upland marsh sequences. The sedimentological properties of the stratigraphic sequences are controlled by overwash processes, tidal channel migrations, duration of tidal flooding, various anthropogenic effects, and sea-level rise. Accretion rates and patterns over the last similar to 200 years, determined from pollen histories, differ between the marshes along the estuarine tributary (Nanticoke River) and those found in the tidal embayment (Monie Bay). Marshes in the upper-estuarine tributary have a larger riverine sediment input, and trapping of the high sediment loads in the upper estuary often yields marsh accretion rates (maximum of 0.74 cm/yr) which are greater than relative sea-level rise (similar to 0.4 cm/yr), resulting in stable marshes. By comparison, estuarine processes limit penetration of high sediment loads to the lower reaches of marshes along the tributary and, as a consequence, accretion rates are generally lower than the rate of relative sea-level rise, and marsh loss is prevalent. Overall, accretion rates in the marshes in the embayment are close to or less than the local sea-level rise and do not have as distinctive spatial patterns as the tributary marshes. Although marsh loss has yet to be identified as a significant: process here, decreases in organic content of the upper sediment column may signal the early stages of submergence due to sea-level rise.

The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge.

This small amount of plant material being preserved is nevertheless sufficient to support marsh-accretion rates similar to the rate of sea-level rise.

"JOUR",14330699,"Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Unger, Viktoria","2018","Geomorphic influences on the contribution of vegetation to soil C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora marshes","Salt marshes are important hotspots of long-term belowground carbon (C) storage, where plant biomass and allochthonous C can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years. However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.","10.5194/bg-15-379-2018","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330699","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040771479&doi=10.5194%2fbg-15-379-2018&partnerID=40&md5=e1cdb8a9dc523eb908d0a9ab98583c97"

High-resolution Holocene sea-level reconstructions depend on the accurate characterization of modern foraminifera-environment relationships representative of a study site. We investigate the relationship between modern foraminiferal assemblage distribution and key environmental variables, viz. elevation above land levelling datum (LLD), sediment grain size, organic content, pH and salinity. We hypothesize that the distribution of modern salt-marsh foraminifera is primarily controlled by elevation above LLD.Location Knysna and Keiskamma estuaries along the southern coastline of South Africa.Methods Salt-marsh surface sediment samples (n = 97) were collected along eight intertidal transects with corresponding environmental data (pH, salinity, organic content, sand, silt, clay and elevation). Multivariate ordination analysis (partial redundancy analysis; pRDA) was used to investigate the relationship between living foraminiferal assemblages and environmental controls, after accounting for spatial variability in community composition.Results The pRDA suggests that species composition varied spatially within estuaries, but was strongly influenced by elevation at Keiskamma (r = 0.63) and Knysna (r = -0.75). At Keiskamma, the main gradient in composition was also influenced by salinity (r = -0.63), in an equal and opposite manner to elevation. Composition at Keiskamma was influenced to a much lesser extent by sediment organic content (r = 0.20) and the clay fraction (r = -0.13). At Knysna, pH (r = 0.455) was a secondary determinant of composition, and sediment characteristics covaried with elevation.Main conclusion Elevation was found to be a key environmental variable controlling the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera at both estuaries, thereby validating the use of foraminifera as sea-level indicators. Certain species were particularly sensitive to elevation changes and could thus serve as useful indicators of past sea-level change. This is an important first step towards the development of high-resolution sea-level reconstructions for the South African coastline.","10.1111/jbi.12698","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330700","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952683485&doi=10.1111%2fjbi.12698&partnerID=40&md5=5cb9b603abb8ff2e69a0c28038468384"

Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a ponds proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

We report measurements of pore fluid and sediment geochemistry, coupled with results from laboratory sediment incubation experiments, and develop a conceptual model to describe the influence of bioturbation on subsurface redox cycling. In the studied sediments the subsurface environment falls into two broadly defined geochemical patterns - iron-rich sediments or sulfide-rich sediments. Within each sediment type nearly identical pore fluid and solid phase geochemistry (in terms of concentrations of iron, sulfate, sulfide, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate) are observed in sediments that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Strictly iron-rich and strictly sulfide-rich sediments, despite their substantive geochemical differences, are observed within spatial distances of less than five meters. We suggest that this bistable system results from a series of feedback reactions that determine ultimately whether sediments will be sulfide-rich or iron-rich. We suggest that an oxidative cycle in the iron-rich sediment, driven by bioirrigation, allows rapid oxidation of organic matter, and that this irrigation impacts the sediment below the immediate physical depth of bioturbation. This oxidative cycle yields iron-rich sediments with low total organic carbon, dominated by microbial iron reduction and no methane production. In the absence of bioirrigation, sediments in the salt marsh become sulfide-rich with high methane concentrations. Our results suggest that the impact of bioirrigation not only drives recycling of sedimentary material but plays a key role in sedimentary interactions among iron, sulfur and carbon.

In this study, we investigated soil organic C and total nitrogen (N) in the whole soils, particulate organic matter (POM) and different aggregate fractions in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in Suaeda salsa clusters and bare grounds in the salt marshes of the Liaohe Delta, China. S. salsa increased soil organic C, total N, POMC and POMN concentrations in both soil layers. Interestingly, the presence of S. salsa caused an increase in the amount of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in both 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths, whereas the vegetation effect on microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt- and clay-sized fractions (< 0.053 mm) differed with soil depth. Compared with bare grounds, S. salsa clusters had higher soil organic C and N contents at each aggregate size class. Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest.

One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ""blue carbon ecosystems"" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.","10.1002/lno.12011","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330712","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122708409&doi=10.1002%2flno.12011&partnerID=40&md5=d81ebb481a511605d40a7fd7aa1ec32d"

From May 1983 to May 1985 the local pollution of this marsh with metals and fluoride was investigated. Samples from soil and vegetation were analysed monthly for cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, manganese, iron, and fluoride. The amount of these substances in the soil appeared to be related to both the percentage of clay particles and organic matter in the soil and to the frequency of tidal submergences. In vegetation, the pollutants clearly showed a seasonal variation. Adherent clay, deposited on the plants during submergences, contributed considerably to the total amount of these elements. Sheep grazing in the marsh were investigated for renal and faecal excretion of these elements, but no relation between these samples and the seasonal variation in vegetation was found. Presumably sheep consumed vegetation selectively, avoiding the more contaminated plants. Regular clinical inspection of the sheep revealed no signs of acute or chronic intoxication. The organs of sheep that died during the investigation showed increased levels of cadmium in the liver and kidney, and iron in the liver, but not enough to cause alarm. Fluoride found in the rib material, although slightly increased, did not indicate fluorosis. In conclusion, contamination with metals and fluoride, as observed in the salt marsh, apparently does not impair the health of locally grazing sheep. This may be due to selective consumption behaviour of the sheep, their stabling during the winter, limited biological availability of the elements studied, and a sheep management adapted to the local circumstances.","10.1080/01652176.1988.9694155","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330713","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023989262&doi=10.1080%2f01652176.1988.9694155&partnerID=40&md5=53eb024746d3e3c7fef556b9a7f781c9"

Mangroves and salt marsh differ in vegetation structure, yet offer similar ecosystem services. This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.","10.1007/s12237-018-0442-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330714","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052137156&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-0442-3&partnerID=40&md5=c787996bb4df80de55eaf84eaf931ca9"

Belowground biomass and PAH levels in below and aboveground material were also determined. In both periods, colonised sediments were oxygenated until 15-cm, rich in organic carbon (max 4.4%) and presented much higher PAH concentrations (max. 7.1 mu g g(-1)) than non-colonised sediments (max. 0.55 mu g g(-1)). Rooting sediments contained the highest PAH concentrations. The five- and six-ring compounds accounted to 50-75% of the total PAHs in colonised sediments, while only to 30% in non-colonised sediments. The elevated concentrations of PAHs in colonised sediments may be attributed to the transfer of dissolved PAH compounds towards the roots as plant uptake water and subsequent sequestration onto organically rich particles. A phase-partitioning mechanism probably explains the higher retention of the heavier PAHs. In addition oxygenated conditions of the rooting sediments favour the degradation of the lighter PAHs and explain the elevated proportion of the heavier compounds. Below and aboveground materials presented lower PAH concentrations (0.18-0.38 mu g g(-1)) than colonised sediments. Only 3- and 4-PAHs were quantified in aboveground material, reflecting either preferential translocation of lighter compounds from roots or atmospheric deposition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Through upstream freshwater marsh, a middle reach including the oligohaline marsh/ mangrove ecotone, and downstream estuarine habitats, we observed systematic variation in soil bulk density, organic content, and pools of phosphorus (P), inorganic sulfur, and extractable iron. Consistent with observed differences in wetland productivity known to be limited by P availability, total P averaged similar to 200 mu g g dw(-1) in soils from the eastern Taylor Slough/Panhandle and was on average three times higher in soils from the western Shark River Slough. Along both transects, the largest pool of phosphorus was the inorganic, carbonate-bound fraction, comprising 35-44% of total P. Greater than 90% of the total inorganic sulfur pool in these south Florida wetland soils was extracted as pyrite. Freshwater marsh sites typically were lower in pyrite sulfur (0.2-0.8 mg g dw(-1)) relative to marsh/mangrove ecotone and downstream estuary sites (0.5-2.9 mg g dw(-1)). Extractable iron in freshwater marsh soils was significantly higher from the Taylor Slough/Panhandle transect (3.2 mg g dw(-1)) relative to the western Shark River Slough transect (1.1 mg g dw(-1)), suggesting spatial variation in sources and/or depositional environments for iron. Further, these soil characteristics represent the collective, integrated signal of ecosystem structure, so any long-term changes in factors like water flow or water quality may be reflected in changes in bulk soil properties. Since the objective of current Everglades restoration initiatives is the enhancement and re-distribution of freshwater flows through the south Florida landscape, the antecedent soil conditions reported here provide a baseline against which future, post-restoration measurements can be compared.","10.1007/s10750-006-0122-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330718",NA

However, there is growing evidence that restored tidal marshes and their services develop slowly and differ from natural tidal marshes in many aspects. Here we focus on groundwater dynamics, because these affect several key ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and vegetation development. We hypothesize that groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are reduced as compared to natural marshes because of the difference in soil structure. In the macro-tidal Schelde estuary (Belgium), in both a natural and a restored (since 2006) freshwater tidal marsh, we measured depth profiles of soil properties (grain size distribution, LOI (loss on ignition), moisture content and bulk density) and temporal dynamics of groundwater levels along a transect with increasing distance from a tidal creek. X-ray micro CT-scanning was used to quantify soil macroporosity. The restored marsh has a two layered soil stratigraphy with a topsoil of freshly accreted sediment (ranging in depth between 10 and 60 cm, deposited since 2006) and a subsoil of compact relict agricultural soil. We found that both the soil in the natural marsh and the topsoil of the restored marsh consist of loosely packed sediment rich in macropores and organic matter, whereas the relict agricultural soil in the restored marsh is densely packed and has few macropores. Our results show that groundwater level fluctuations in the restored marsh are restricted to the top layer of newly deposited sediment (i.e. on average 0.08 m depth). Groundwater level fluctuations in the natural marsh occur over a larger depth of the soil profile (i.e. on average 0.28 m depth). As a consequence, the reduced groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are expected to alter the subsurface fluxes of water and nutrients, the source sink function and the development of marsh vegetation.","10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.006","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330724","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082525252&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2019.02.006&partnerID=40&md5=95bab27bd92463f39fb544ea94aab87b"

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants. This effect, combined with the plant capability to retain hydrocarbons around the roots, points out that salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations may actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation in estuarine environments.","10.1007/s10532-010-9446-9","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330725","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79957959296&doi=10.1007%2fs10532-010-9446-9&partnerID=40&md5=1166a3f1de37898d2e6ba895d7708006"

Plants showed strong growth responses to N and NP additions but not to P. Nitrogen levels in the shoots and roots of Puccinellia phryganodes declined as summer progressed. Microbial biomass was low in spring in spite of N and P additions, likely due to C limitation, but values rose in autumn, independent of nutrient treatment, as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased. Glucose addition (C source) elicited a transitory increase in microbial biomass. Multiple plant defoliations by geese had a negative effect on microbial biomass, in spite of the presence of DOC and added N and P, possibly because hypersalinity restricted growth. Plants appear to limit soil inputs of C in summer and compete effectively for resources in contrast to autumn, indicating a temporal partitioning of resources.","10.1007/s11104-009-9915-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330734","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894257392&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-009-9915-2&partnerID=40&md5=97ec0ce084223996863cae489d683e12"

Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103 +/- 61 Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30 +/- 30 Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32 +/- 1 Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197 Mg/ha (RMSE = 24 Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (similar to 3 mol/m(2)/y) is equal to similar to 24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.","10.1029/2020GB006785","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330735","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104318228&doi=10.1029%2f2020GB006785&partnerID=40&md5=a63b98d97469bf195c775eca4ade5643"

A decreased concentration in atmospheric CO2 7000-10 000 yr ago has been linked to variations in peatland C accumulation rates attributed to a warm climate and increased productivity. Yet, this period also corresponds to early stages of peatland development (as peatland was expanding) following retreat of ice sheets and increases in C storage could be associated with wetland evolution via lake filling or following marine shoreline emergence. Unravelling past links amongst peatland dynamics, C storage, and climate will help us assess potential feedbacks from future changes in these systems, but most studies are hampered by low temporal resolution. Here we provide a decadal scale C accumulation record for a fen that has begun transformation from salt marsh within the last 70 yr on the isostatically rebounding coast of James Bay, Qu,bec. We determined time frames for wetland stages using palynological analyses to reconstruct ecological change and Pb-210 and Cs-137 to date the deposit. The average short-term C accumulation rates during the low and high tidal marsh and incipient fen stage (42, 87 and 182 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) were as much as six times higher than the global long-term (millennial) average for northern peatlands. We suggest that the atmospheric CO2 flux during the early Holocene could be attributed, in part, to wetland evolution associated with isostatic rebound, which makes land for new wetland formation. Future climate warming will increase eustatic sea level, decrease rates of land emergence and formation of new coastal wetlands, ultimately decreasing rates of C storage of wetlands on rebounding coastlines.","10.5194/bg-9-2711-2012","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864626939&doi=10.5194%2fbg-9-2711-2012&partnerID=40&md5=5449d4b07a45c589ac1443cc73e5a820"

Bulk density and percent organic matter content of peat fluctuated through time at all sites, suggesting that peat formation processes are dynamic and responsive to watershed conditions. The balance between inorganic sedimentation and organic accumulation at the sites also varied through time, indicating that marshes may rely more strongly on either inorganic or organic matter for peat formation at particular times in their existence.

"JOUR",14330748,"Yang, Ren-Min","2019","Interacting Effects of Plant Invasion, Climate, and Soils on Soil Organic Carbon Storage in Coastal Wetlands","Coastal wetland soils store large amounts of organic carbon, which is becoming vulnerable to environmental changes such as exotic species invasion and climate change. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.","10.1029/2019JG005190","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330748",NA

Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply.

Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.","10.1002/ecy.2916","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330756",NA

These dynamics were investigated by the simultaneous estimation of primary production, litter production, decomposition processes and accumulation of organic matter in sediment. We used harvested biomass techniques and the litter-bag method, as well as more recent techniques such as determination of natural isotopic compositions. The results of this study have been compared with those of other studies of salt marshes of the Eastern Coast of America dominated by Spartina alterniflora.Studies of the fate of halophytic organic matter in salt marshes have shown that processes such as consumption, decomposition, or flooding rapidly could distribute organic material to different compartments of the marsh system. Aboveground productivity of A. portulacoides was 1700 g m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 80% of this production was transformed rapidly in necromass. A large part of this dead material (86%) fell as litter directly onto the sediment at the sampling site. The remainder was washed away by tides, either out of the marsh, or into the upper marsh where it accumulated in drift lines. Decomposition of A. portulacoides on the sediment was followed using litter-bags. Decay constants, based on the first order decay function, ranged between 0.0404 d(-1) and 0.0113 d(-1) and appeared high when compare with data obtained in other American and European salt marshes. Nitrogen immobilisation was not detectable in this decomposition experiment. During decay, nitrogen concentrations increased, whereas absolute amount of nitrogen decreased. After microbial decomposition, plant detritus was rapidly incorporated into sediment. The carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment showed that organic matter in the middle marsh came from both aboveground production of A. portulacoides and microalgae. The patterns for these two kinds of organic matter in different granulometric fractions depended on tidal submersion frequency. During the summer, when the salt marsh was not disturbed by tides, the clay fraction got richer in plant organic matter, whereas, during the other periods, this fraction was characterized by microalgal organic matter.This study provides new data about the dynamic of organic matter. It remains still difficult to establish comparisons between North American and European salt marsh functioning according to the variability of primary production, microbial decomposition and tidal range in these ecosystems.","10.1007/978-94-011-5266-2_6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330762","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031693383&doi=10.1007%2f978-94-011-5266-2_6&partnerID=40&md5=bf92354cc591181849b3cdde8bb0d204"

Scott) and bulk sediment from a SW European salt marsh (Tagus estuary, Portugal) were subjected to sequential extractions and analysed to assess the rare earth elements (REE) geochemical fractionation and to evaluate the plants' role in the mobility and bioavailability of these elements. The results showed that REE were mainly bound to the residual (yttrium and heavy-REE) and carbonate (middle-REE and heavy-REE) fractions, followed by the reducible and oxidisable (light-REE and middle-REE) fractions, while the easily soluble fraction was negligible. This fractionation evidenced a sediment REE mobility mainly dependent not only on carbonates but also on Fe=Mn oxyhydroxides and on organic matter content. On the other hand, REE associated with the reducible and oxidisable fractions, and particularly the redoxsensitive Ce, may becomemore available, due to the redox condition seasonal changes that occur in saltmarshes' sediments promoted by the plants' activity.

Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.","10.1007/s002679900219","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330778","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033008677&doi=10.1007%2fs002679900219&partnerID=40&md5=a02872bdefb52ba1e43eaf0502d16830"

The determination of average and median concentrations of insecticides and PCB in sediment from cores to a depth of 35 cm identified a degree of contamination that may be considered background in this area. Two sites, at Two Tree Island (in the Thames estuary) and at Bridgewick on the Dengie peninsula, were found to exhibit enhanced degrees of contamination.There was no evidence to link elevated sediment organochlorine concentrations with higher organic carbon content or particle size distribution of the sediments. Distribution of contaminants within sediment particle size fractions, was however, related to the proportion of organic carbon in the < 64 mu m fraction. The most significant factor influencing the degree of contamination with OCL and PCB is likely to be the source of sediments deposited on the salt marsh.

Over three seasons in three regions of San Francisco Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo, and South San Francisco bays), we characterized locations in tidal marshes where monotypic stands of L. latifolium are replacing the native Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed). Soils within L. latifolium stands had significantly lower moisture, salinity, organic matter, and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) and higher pH than in adjacent S. pacifica stands at similar elevation and distance from channels. In addition, L. latifolium canopies were 2 to 3 times taller, thus increasing light reaching soils, and tended to support different insect/spider assemblages (sampled only at the Suisun site). Patterns were generally consistent across the three sites, although less pronounced for some measures at the South Bay site. Overall, these data suggest that L. latifolium invasion of tidal marshes is leading to modification of both structural and functional properties, several of which might further facilitate spread of the invader; however, additional study is needed to determine cause vs. effect for several soil characteristics.","10.1614/IPSM-D-09-00015.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330783","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954010269&doi=10.1614%2fIPSM-D-09-00015.1&partnerID=40&md5=0bf7b98ca25f40185a40fee874716dd6"

Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa.

There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.","10.1002/2014WR016253","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330797",NA

On the Atlantic seaboard of the Iberian Peninsula a great swath of tidal wetlands, which correspond to semi-confined estuaries, represents land reclaimed from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and used for urban development or agricultural production. These interventions led to the end of tidal flooding in extensive areas of salt marshes, Causing a drop in the water table that triggered pyrite oxidization processes, leaching of cations and salts and soil acidification. In many cases, these transformations have given rise to environmental problems such as the development of acid sulphate soils, a resulting decrease in pH, and the leaching of carbonates. The organic carbon storage capacity has also been altered, and the release of metal cations from sediments has caused toxic waters to appear.In order to investigate the alterations caused by the historic reclamation of estuarine soils on the north coast of Spain, natural and reclaimed lands were mapped in two estuaries (Villaviciosa and San Vicente de la Barquera) and zoned in accordance with flood frequency.The different evolutionary paths of the two studied estuarine sites after reclamation can be assessed through the description and analysis of their soils despite reclamation, some parts (i.e. lower areas) of the reclaimed lands do not remain fully isolated from tidal dynamics, whose influence varies throughout the soil profiles that have developed since. The strength of the morphological (e.g. genetic horizons). chemical (pH, metal cation concentration) and functional (balance of the carbon budget) changes suffered by the original soils seem to depend strongly on the remaining tidal influence as well as the land use of the area.

However, the effectiveness of this restoration method is still questioned. Wetland structural characteristics were compared between four created and three natural salt marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA. The created marshes, formed by the pumping of dredge material into formerly open water areas, represent a chronosequence, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years. Vegetation and soil structural factors were compared to determine whether the created marshes become more similar over time to the natural salt marshes. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2002 using the line-intercept technique.,Site elevations were measured in 2000. Organic matter (OM) was measured in 1996 and 2002, while bulk density and soil particle-size distribution were determined in 2002 only. The natural marshes were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, as were the oldest created marshes; these marshes had the lowest mean site elevations (< 30 cm NGVD). The six-year-old created marsh (formed in 1996) was higher in elevation (> 35 cm NGVD) and became dominated by high marsh (S. patens, Distichlis spicata) and shrub (Baccharis halimifolia, Iva frutescens) species. The higher elevation marsh seems to be following a different plant successional trajectory than the other marshes, indicating a relationship between marsh elevation and species composition. The soils in both the created and natural marshes contain high levels of clays (30-65 %), with sand comprising < 1 % of the soil distribution. OM was significantly greater and bulk density significantly lower in two of the natural marshes when compared to the created marshes. The oldest created marsh had significantly greater OM than the younger created marshes, but it may still take several decades before equivalency is reached with the natural marshes. Vegetation structural characteristics in the created marshes take only a few years to become similar to those in the natural marshes, just so long as the marshes are formed at a proper elevation. This agrees with other studies from North Carolina and Texas. However, it will take several decades for the soil characteristics to reach equivalency with the natural marshes, if they ever will.","10.1672/10-20","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330802","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0041568541&doi=10.1672%2f10-20&partnerID=40&md5=79440d1099097d215b86995c5da15857"

In October 2015, we conducted surveys on crab burrows in three typical salt marsh habitats in the northern tidal flat of Chongming Island; Phragmites australis habitat, Spartina alterniflora habitat, and P. australis - S. alterniflorg, mixed habitat. In each habitat, the characteristics of crab burrows and related factors, including macrobenthos, vegetation, and sediment, were surveyed. The results indicated that the type of the habitat influenced the crab burrow distributions and their related factors. Burrow densities and opening diameters were significantly different among the different habitats (P < 0.05). The burrow density in P. australis habitat was significantly higher than that in S. alterniflora habitat (P < 0.05), whereas the burrow opening diameter in S. alterniflora habitat was significantly greater than that in P. australis habitat (P < 0.05).

The differences among the habitats in the total carbon content, total nitrogen content, and median particle diameter of the sediments varied with depth. The different combinations of habitat factors resulted in a variation in the distribution characteristics of crab burrows.

Salt marshes of both estuaries are dominated by Spartina alterrallora. An analysis was performed to characterize marsh hypsometry and tidal flooding characteristics, and a coring study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment accumulation, organic matter accumulation, and vertical accretion using Cs-137 and Pb-210 chronology at nine sites in both estuaries. Mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation rates were significantly higher in Delaware Bay marshes (sediment mean and 1 sigma. 2.57 +/- 2.03 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.65 +/- 0.26 kg m(-2) year(-1)) than in Barnegat Bay (sediment: 0.31 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.29 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) year(-1)), as were rates of accretion (Delaware Bay: 0.79 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1); Barnegat Bay: 0.28 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1)). Regression analysis indicated that marsh accretion rates were positively correlated with rates of sediment and organic accumulation, but the upper limit of accretion was governed by sediment accumulation. Tidal flooding frequency and duration did not correlate with marsh accumulation or accretion rates in either estuary, suggesting that hydroperiod is subordinate to sediment availability in governing rates on 50-100 year time scales.

The subterranean estuary, the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and sea water in a coastal aquifer, has a high potential to remove substantial N. A network of piezometers was used to characterize the denitrification capacity and groundwater flow paths in the subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh. ""N-enriched nitrate was injected into the subterranean estuary (in situ push-pull method) to evaluate the denitrification capacity of the saturated zone at multiple depths (125300 cm) below different zones (upland-marsh transition zone, high marsh, and low marsh). From the upland to low marsh, the water table became shallower, groundwater dissolved oxygen decreased, and groundwater pH, soil organic carbon, and total root biomass increased. As groundwater approached the high and low marsh, the hydraulic gradient increased and deep groundwater upwelled. In the warm season (groundwater temperature > 12 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity within each zone was observed. The warm season low marsh groundwater denitrification capacity was significantly higher than all other zones and depths. In the cool season (groundwater temperature < 10.5 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity was only found in the low marsh. Additions of dissolved organic carbon did not alter groundwater denitrification capacity suggesting that an alternative electron donor, possibly transported by tidal inundation from the root zone, may be limiting. Combining flow paths with denitrification capacity and saturated porewater residence time, we estimated that as much as 29-60 mg N could be removed from 11 of water flowing through the subterranean estuary below the low marsh, arguing for the significance of subterranean estuaries in annual watershed scale N budgets.","10.1007/BF02696018","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330820","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-31144457667&doi=10.1007%2fBF02696018&partnerID=40&md5=0befedec4a28888fceff3be83a6c0794"

To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.","10.1002/eap.1489","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330822","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017160341&doi=10.1002%2feap.1489&partnerID=40&md5=74760e15fcb06379ce675ae824f13a8b"

However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the loss of marsh vegetation because of human-driven disturbances such as sea level rise and oil spills can potentially reduce marsh capacity for N removal. To investigate the effect of vegetation loss on ecosystem N removal, we contrasted denitrification capacity in marsh and subtidal sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using a combination of N-29(2) and N-30(2) production (isotope pairing), denitrification potential measurements (acetylene block), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of functional genes in the denitrification pathway. We found that, on average, denitrification capacity was 4 times higher in vegetated sediments because of a combination of enhanced nitrification and higher organic carbon availability. The abundance of nirS-type denitrifers indicated that marsh vegetation regulates the activity, rather than the abundance, of denitrifier communities. We estimated that marsh sediments remove an average of 3.6 t N km(-2) y(-1) compared to 0.9 t N km(-2) y(-1) in unvegetated sediments.

Two of the lagoons have their origin in the old river mouths while the other three were recently created in the framework of a Life Restoration project. This fact has also allowed us to study the effect of the lagoon age on nutrient and zooplankton composition and dynamics. The salt marsh hydrology is determined by a prolonged period of confinement without water inputs, irregularly interrupted by sudden water inputs due to flooding events (sea storms or intense rain-falls). While the dynamics of oxidized nitrogen compounds in the lagoons depends on the water inputs variability within each hydrological cycle, the internal load of phosphorus, total nitrogen and organic matter is related more to the cumulative mechanisms during the confinement periods. Accumulation processes may be easily related to lagoon age, since old lagoons have higher content of nutrients and organic matter, suggesting that these lagoons progressively accumulate nutrients during the successive confinement events. This is the usual case for most Mediterranean salt marshes without an artificially manipulated water regime. The zooplankton community in La Pletera integrates the effects of both the hydrological regime and the lagoon age since the former determines the temporal pattern of the main zooplankton species and the latter explains differences in composition and structure between old and new lagoons.

Previous studies reported that the invasion alters biogeochemical and microbial processes in marsh ecosystems, yet our knowledge of changing archaeal community due to the invasion is still limited, whereas archaeal communities play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles within highly reduced marsh soils. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the influences of the Spartina anglica invasion on soil archaeal community and the depth profile of the influences. The relative abundance of archaeal phyla demonstrated that the invasion substantially shifted the characteristics of tidal salt marsh from marine to terrestrial soil only in surface layer, while the influences indirectly propagated to the deeper soil layer. In particular, two archaeal phyla, Asgardaeota and Diapherotrites, were strongly influenced by the invasion, indicating a shift from marine to terrestrial archaeal communities. The shifts in soil characteristics spread to the deeper soil layer that results in indirect propagation of the influences of the invasion down to the deeper soil, which was underestimated in previous studies. The changes in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and salinity were the substantial regulating factors for that. Therefore, changes in biogeochemical and microbial characteristics in the deep soil layer, which is below the root zone of the invasive plant, should be accounted for a more accurate illustration of the consequences of the invasion.","10.1007/s00248-021-01770-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330829","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106309694&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-021-01770-3&partnerID=40&md5=695f59d5b10f519b52ce278c7d064d62"

The total area of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986 to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH, salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH, salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in NO3--N.

Understanding these characteristics will help better to guide beneficial use of wetlands in processing nitrate. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and denitrification rate in Louisiana coastal wetlands. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from three different wetlands along a salinity gradient, namely, bottomland forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM) located in the Barataria Basin estuary. Potential denitrification rate (PDR) was measured by acetylene inhibition method and distribution of carbon (C) moieties in organic C was determined by C-13 solid-state NMR. Of the three wetlands, the FM soil profile exhibited the highest PDR on both unit weight and unit volume basis as compared to FS and SM. The FM also tended to yield higher amount of N2O as compared to the FS and SM especially at earlier stages of denitrification, suggesting incomplete reduction of NO3- at FM and potential for emission of N2O. Saline marsh soil profile had the lowest PDR on the unit volume basis. Increasing incubation concentration from 2 to 10 mg NO3--N L-1 increased PDR by 2 to 6 fold with the highest increase in the top horizons of FS and SM soils. Regression analysis showed that across these three wetland systems, organic C has significant effect in regulating PDR. Of the compositional C moieties, polysaccharides positively influenced denitrification. rate whereas phenolics (likely phenolic adehydes and ketonics) negatively affected denitrification rate in these wetland soils. These results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of wetlands for treating nutrient-rich biosolids and wastewaters, non-point source agricultural runoff, and nitrate found in the diverted Mississippi River water used for coastal restoration.

The RDI values declined quickly from surface soils to subsurface soils and then kept a small change in deeper soils along soil profiles over the incubation time. Denitrification proceeded much faster in the top 20 cm soils of open wetland than in the closed wetland, whereas no significant differences in RDI values were observed in deeper soils between both wetlands. The RDIs were significantly negatively correlated with bulk density and sand content, while a significantly positive correlation with clay content, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous.

Because of its low relief, population increase and economic development during the last century, the Celestun lagoon is highly vulnerable to global change, including sea level rise. Here, we study a sediment core from a tropical saltmarsh to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on sediment accretion and carbon fluxes. Some geochemical indicators in a Pb-210 dated sediment core showed clear signals of marine influence. This was reflected on increased accretion rates, from 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1) in 1941 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 mm yr(-1) in 2012. These accretion rates were similar to eustatic sea level rise, and mean acceleration ranged from 0.037-0.22 mm yr(-2) implying a SLR by 2100 ranging from 14 to 86 cm. The one-century (1917-2013) organic carbon stock in sediments was calculated to be 10.1 +/- 0.2 Mg C ha(-1). During the same period, the organic carbon flux, corrected for organic carbon degradation, increased from 7 +/- 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to 73 +/- 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1), attributed to the impact of sea level rise in this ecosystem.

This belowground production adds to the accumulation of organic matter sustaining salt marshes as sea level rises, thus preventing excessive flooding, eventual plant death, and habitat loss. The ubiquitous nutrient enrichment of coastal salt marshes stimulating aboveground plant growth may result in higher rates of inorganic matter accumulation that compensates for marsh flooding caused by sea level rise. Results from several short-term experiments, however, demonstrate that root and rhizome biomass and carbon accumulation is reduced with nutrient enrichment, suggesting that eutrophication of coastal waters may not be a compensatory counterbalance to the effects of global sea level rise on salt marshes. We show that the net effects of 36 yr of nutrient enrichment in replicated field experiments do not lead to higher organic or inorganic accumulation. Enrichment reduces organic matter belowground and may result in a significant loss in marsh elevation equivalent to about half the average global sea level rise rates. Sustaining and restoring coastal emergent marshes is more likely if they receive less, not more, nutrient loading.","10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1634","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330856","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67949115517&doi=10.4319%2flo.2009.54.5.1634&partnerID=40&md5=1367729c5676c86cc2f51c5a6c975f39"

To investigate this, we measured in situ net N mineralization rates throughout the growing season in three zones of a Maine high salt marsh, Juncus gerardii, Spartina patens, and mixed perennial forb. We also measured microclimate factors ( soil temperatures and moistures) and substrate quality parameters ( soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil C: N ratio) to see if either related to differences in net N mineralization. To determine the relative importance of substrate quality and microclimate, we measured N mineralization of the different soil types in the laboratory, holding microclimate parameters constant. We also investigated the relative importance of microclimate and substrate statistically, with principal components analysis and multiple regression. In situ net N mineralization rates were significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but graminoid zone N mineralization rates did not vary significantly from each other. Soil temperatures, moistures, carbon, and nitrogen were all significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but C: N ratio did not vary significantly across zones. Principal components analysis and multiple regression revealed that microclimate was a more significant predictor of total N mineralized over the course of the growing season than was substrate quality. In contrast, when microclimate conditions were held constant, forb zone N mineralization was still significantly higher than that of graminoid zones, suggesting that substrate quality does exert some control on this process. Thus, both microclimate and substrate quality appear to influence N mineralization rates across vegetation zones of this Maine salt marsh.","10.1023/A:1023974109113","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330857","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038819956&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1023974109113&partnerID=40&md5=e27edc03f413218fb860f6ead0b74a3e"

In cores from the central and southern lagoon, significant changes of the sediment features occur with time, reflecting the evolution of the lagoon hydrodynamic conditions and the increasing influence of the Adriatic Sea. Sediment features also distinguish depositional environments: in particular salt marsh sediments are calcium depleted, compared to the neighboring lagoon sediments, due to the preferential dissolution of calcite in subaerial environments.

Our results showed that the SOC and TN content and storage in the in-vestigated sites increased with restoration time. However, the restoration rate was faster in the first 8 years but slowed down after 8 years of restoration. The SOC and TN content and storage decreased with soil depths in the eight sites. After 27 years of restoration, the carbon and nitrogen storage in the restored site was 2.8 and 1.9 times that in the soybean field, respec-tively. However, the SOC and TN storage in the 27-year restored site was 45.3% and 35.1% lower than that in the natural marsh, respectively. The SOC and TN content, bulk density, moisture content, clay, and plant belowground biomass significantly impact the SOC and TN storage (P < 0.01). This study indicates that marsh restoration contributes to the accumulation of SOC and TN, but the restoration of SOC and TN storage to the level of natural marshes may take decades.

Recent sedimentation rates at the restricted marshes (as determined by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) were positive and averaged 78% (Cs-137) and 50% (Pb-210) of reference marsh sedimentation rates. The accumulation of inorganic sediment was similar at the restricted and reference marshes, perhaps because of the seasonal operation of the tide gates, while organic sediment accretion (and pore space) was significantly lower in the restricted marshes, perhaps because of higher decomposition rates. Sedimentation rates at the restored marsh were significantly higher than at the reference marshes. This marsh has responded to the higher water levels resulting from restoration by a rapid increase in marsh surface elevation.","10.2307/1352980","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330868","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032830607&doi=10.2307%2f1352980&partnerID=40&md5=529ea46c24fdbec1494eb7445487ebaf"

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.","10.3389/fevo.2019.00151","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330872","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066803382&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2019.151&partnerID=40&md5=0f06be611f1086b7e4c91f364cc0fc22"

We investigated the potential for an organic carbon sediment amendment, alginate, to enhance establishment and growth of Spartina alterniflora transplants, as well as colonization by macroinvertebrates commonly associated with S. alterniflora (Uca sp. and Littoraria irrorata). Plots were established in a bare mud area previously inhabited by S. alterniflora, and transplant rhizospheres were either treated with alginate or left unamended as controls. Growth of transplanted S. alterniflora and colonization by Uca sp. and L. irrorata were evaluated over portions of three growing seasons. Within the first month post-transplantation, a nonsignificant trend toward greater live stem density emerged, but disappeared completely by week ten. Both Uca sp. and L. irrorata densities were significantly greater in the alginate treatment compared to the control only during the first ten weeks post-transplantation. However, the initial organic content of the sediment in the transplant area was more than twice that in the adjacent natural marsh. Therefore, our findings suggest that a threshold level of sediment organic matter above which alginate addition does not confer an advantage on transplanted S. alterniflora may exist, and the conditions under which amendments are most beneficial to transplanted S. alterniflora should be determined.","10.1007/s11273-014-9345-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330873","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904416364&doi=10.1007%2fs11273-014-9345-7&partnerID=40&md5=eb51c948382c07198499a819fba62ba2"

The range of vertical accretion and inorganic accumulation rates were 0.09 to 1.78 cm y(-1), and 0.01 to 0.53 g cm y(-1), respectively. The volume of the accumulated organic and inorganic in all salt marshes averaged 3.8 and 4.9%, respectively, of the total, which is relatively low among soil types. The remaining soil volume is water and air. There was a direct relationship between vertical accretion and organic accumulation that explained 59% of the variation for all samples combined. In contrast, the bulk density is strongly and directly related to inorganic content, but not the vertical accretion rate. A multiple regression equation describing the vertical accumulation as a function of mineral and organic accumulation suggests that organic accumulation is five times more important than inorganic accumulation for East coast salt marshes (n = 19; weight basis), but that inorganic content is a statistically-insignificant factor for Gulf of Mexico salt marshes (n = 122), or for all salt marshes examined (n = 141). A simple linear regression showed that a 1 cm rise in salt marsh elevation was composed of 10.9 g of organic matter. A threshold level of 0.02 g organic matter y(-1) accumulation can continue without inorganic accumulation. It appears that it is the accumulation of organic matter that controls inorganic accumulation in established marshes, not the reverse. These results document the dominant role of below ground plant material in maintaining salt marshes once they are established. When wetland hydrology is altered, it is the organic soil constituents that are affected (through oxidation or plant growth below ground), thus explaining salt marsh conversion to open water through indirect changes in hydrology. Salt marsh management and restoration efforts would do well to keep in mind the plant's health, especially belowground, if the long-term and effective strategies are to be successfully implemented. The biological components, not the geological components, appear to control the fate of established salt marshes.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330877",NA

Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.","10.1029/2019GB006334","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330878","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085510472&doi=10.1029%2f2019GB006334&partnerID=40&md5=28faad69926cd358d52f3640c59d23e5"

Mining waste deposits originated four decades ago, by the metallurgical extraction of heavy metals, are found near to the San Antonio salt marsh in Patagonia. The aim of the work was to determine the geochemical processes that control the distribution and concentration of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the soils of this Patagonian salt marsh. A survey of themining waste deposits was carried outwhere three dumpswere identified. Samples were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter and metal contents and the soil mineralogical composition. The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit. Finally, the heavymetal pollutants recorded in the San Antonio saltmarsh shows that the mining waste deposits that were abandoned four decades ago are still a source metal contamination.

Acid phosphatase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase presented significantly higher EEA in Rosario than in Pancas, whereas the opposite occurred for peroxidase.

"JOUR",14330888,"Bouchard, V.; Lefeuvre, J.-C.","2000","Primary production and macro-detritus dynamics in a European salt marsh: carbon and nitrogen budgets","Primary production and the detritus pathway (i.e., detritus production, litter fall, export to coastal waters, and decomposition) were studied over a I-year period in three salt marsh levels (low, middle and high marshes). Carbon and nitrogen content in biomass and macro-detritus were estimated at each step of the detrital pathway. Several lines of evidence suggested that low, middle and high marshes had different properties which affected their interaction with adjoining waters. More than species diversity, the salt marsh zonation across a 1.8 km transect resulted in a spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of organic matter and nutrients within the salt marsh. The low marsh was the less productive level (1080 g dry weight m-(2) per year) and was a source of organic matter for the two other marsh levels. Almost 89% of the organic matter produced in the low marsh was flushed away by the tide and redistributed inside the marsh, whereas the remainder decomposed quickly (0.023 per day) at the production site. The export of macro-detritus to coastal waters was probably insignificant to the carbon and nitrogen balance of the salt marsh. In the middle and high marshes, most of the production fell as litter directly at the production site. In the high marsh, vegetation stands were very productive (1990 g dry weight m(-2) per year) and litter decomposed slowly (0.0047 per day), The middle marsh was as productive as the high marsh (1910 g dry weight m(-2) per day), but the decay rate (0.028 per day) was similar to that estimated for the low marsh. This study demonstrates that the mineralization of halophyte-derived organic matter takes place almost completely within the marsh itself. Data on carbon and nitrogen decay indicated that only a small part of the high marsh production was rapidly available to fuel food webs of the ecosystem or to be exported to coastal waters. In contrast, the high amount of biomass produced in the middle marsh was rapidly available for food webs, Export of organic matter may be controlled by macro-detritus production (amount and timing), intensity and time distribution of tide events, and, mostly, decay rates. Because for most of the year the marsh is exposed to the atmosphere, we suggest that exchanges of gaseous carbon and nitrogen with the atmosphere should be investigated.

Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.","10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330890","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a"

At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.","10.1128/AEM.00784-17","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330895","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030695399&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00784-17&partnerID=40&md5=967ec70a42723bb8bcf6dda398a2b8da"

Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.","10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120503","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330903","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114035745&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2021.120503&partnerID=40&md5=a10c600910c714f7cee95362bb10ec77"

Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

Soil cores were collected across transects in each marsh to a depth of 1 m. Samples were divided by horizon and analyzed for bulk density and carbon concentration. The restored marsh had wider ranges of bulk density and C concentrations due to the presence of both organic and mineral soil materials. Horizons from the restored marsh had a mean bulk density of 0.50 g cm(-3) while the reference marsh averaged 0.09 g cm(-3). Carbon concentrations were greater in the reference marsh (30%) than the restored marsh (13%). The average carbon content in the restored marsh was 35 kg m(-2) while the reference marsh has only 24 kg m(-2) due to a greater bulk density. New organic material deposited over the dredge material represents surface carbon accumulation of 1.8 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1).

To evaluate the spatial variation of CH4 emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S. alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh.

Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.","10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330915","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5"

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

For both PAHs studied, mean BSAFs were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in both organisms in sediments from Bayou Trepagnier (BSAF = 0.628 g OC g TLE-1), a brackish swamp, compared to Pass Fourchon (0.065 g OC g TLE-1), a coastal salt marsh. In order to explain observed patterns in BSAFs, organic carbon-normalized PAH distribution coefficients between the sediment and freely dissolved phases (K-OC)(OBS) were determined as well as the various geochemical variables of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM, respectively). These included analyses of particle surface area, total organic carbon (TOC), carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Bayou Trepagnier was higher in surface area, TOC, C:N, as well as DOC suggesting that the difference in BSAFs may be attributed to compositional differences in POM and DOM between sites. We can not exclude the possibility that other factors (such as differences in organism behavior resulting from contrasting sediment characteristics) were responsible for BSAFs varying between the two sites. Phenanthrene BSAFs were typically higher than b[a]p BSAFs, suggesting contaminants were limited in their desorption from sediment particles as a function of PAH molecular weight. Mean BSAFs for both PAHs were higher on Day 7 than on Day 14. The reason for this decrease is unclear, but did not appear to be due to organisms becoming increasingly stressed in the microcosms. Visual observations indicated that animals remained feeding while no decreases in organism total lipid levels were detected. The trends in BSAFs between sites and over the time course of this experiment suggest that contaminant bioaccumulation in estuarine systems should not be considered to be an equilibrium process.","10.2307/1353003","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330927","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034487019&doi=10.2307%2f1353003&partnerID=40&md5=c3b7dc7d59095d86c308c4e158c220b5"

Trace element contamination was negligible in seagrass sediments, but minor to severe, depending on the element, in salt marsh cores, owing to higher organic carbon and fine sediment contents. EF temporal variation in salt marsh cores was attributed to agriculture technology changes (e.g. installation of greenhouses, and improved irrigation and fertilization systems). Trace element flux ratios increased during the past 100 years, likely caused by steadily increasing sediment accumulation rates promoted by land-use changes in the catchment.

The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth.2 In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of (NH4Cl)-N-15 into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial N-15 excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of N-15. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated N-15 such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils.3 The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer.4 Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of N-15 in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion.5 Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention.","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01214.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330939","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846906490&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2745.2007.01214.x&partnerID=40&md5=24d5f8f0d1a0172b558772001ed0f87c"

Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils. The findings of this work provide a potential explanation for the ""missing"" carbon sinks at a larger scale.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110618","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330943",NA

Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.","10.1111/gcb.13082","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330945","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954167983&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13082&partnerID=40&md5=51d641e0070edfb33c81a56c69408984"

However, we know little about how this landscape complementation may influence the distribution of an invasive species' ecological impacts and, in turn, how this affects ecosystem resilience to disturbance. We surveyed > 820 km of coastline to evaluate how landscape complementation mediates patterns in invasive feral hog (Sus scrofa) rooting, trampling and wallowing disturbances in southeastern US salt marshes and assessed marsh resilience to these behaviors in an 8-site survey and 13-month field experiment. We discovered that hog rooting and trampling most often occur where hardwood forest comprises > 30% and salt marsh < 22% of habitat surrounding each surveyed site, respectively, while wallowing correlated most strongly with salt marsh invertebrate densities. At the 8 survey sites, vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, and surface elevation were consistently lower, and soil anoxia and porewater ammonium-nitrogen higher, in hog-disturbed relative to undisturbed areas. The experiment revealed that vegetation can recover when rooted or trampled, but remains depressed when wallowed or repeatedly disturbed. Together, these findings provide novel evidence that habitat patch composition at landscape scales can act together with local habitat attributes to dictate invasive species' disturbance patterns and highlight areas most vulnerable to invaders. In salt marshes, insights gleaned from such consideration of landscape complementation can inform conservation and management strategies for curbing the impact of this prolific, global invader.","10.1007/s10530-019-02018-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330956","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066785434&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-019-02018-5&partnerID=40&md5=860d3108125cef4c0efaa917e4cacdf7"

This study analyzes blue carbon stocks in northern Florida wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Carbon measurements within 1-3m length vibracores yield total core stocks of 9.9-21.5 kgC·m2 and 7.7-10.9 kgC·m2 for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates in the top meter are 7.0 kgC·m2-8.0 kgC·m2 and 6.1 kgC·m2-8.6 kgC·m2 for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta13C, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following relative sea-level rise. These transgressions impact carbon storage within the cores as the presence of carbon-poor soils, characteristic of non-blue carbon habitats, result in lower 1m carbon stocks in north Florida Gulf wetlands, and a deeper extent of carbon-rich soils, characteristic of blue carbon habitats, drive higher 1m and total carbon stocks in north Florida Atlantic wetlands. Future blue carbon research should assess carbon stocks down to bedrock when possible, as land-cover and/or climate change can impact different depths across localities.

Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were determined on the same samples using an elemental CHN analyzer. Regression analyses indicated that LOI and KN were excellent estimators of organic C (R2 = 0.990) and total N (R2 = 0.986), respectively, in low clay content (0-11%) marsh soils containing a wide range of soil organic C (0.1-28%) and total N (0-1.6%). A quadratic equation best described the relationship between organic C and organic matter (Organic C = 0.40 [LOI] + 0.0025 [LOI]2) while a linear model accurately described the relationship between total N and Kjeldahl N (Total N = 1.048 [KN] - 0.010). The proportion of organic C in organic matter (C/OM) increased with increasing soil organic matter content, probably as a result of aging. Young marshes, which are characterized by low soil organic content contain C/OM ratios similar to emergent vegetation (40-45%).

Since then it has rapidly replaced the native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa, becoming one of the dominant vegetation types in the coastal wetlands of China. Although plant invasion can change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, little is known about how plant invasion influences C storage within soil fractions. We investigated how S. altemiflora invasion across an 8, 12 and 14-year chronosequence affected SOC and soil nitrogen (N), using soil fractionation and stable delta C-13 isotope analyses. SOC and N concentrations at 0-10 cm depth in S. altemiflora soil increased during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence, ranging from 3.67 to 4.90 g C kg(-1) soil, and from 0.307 to 0.391 g N kg(-1) soil. These were significantly higher than the values in the Suaeda salsa community, by 27.0-69.6% for SOC. and 21.8-55.2% for total N. The S. alterniflora-derived SOC varied from 0.40 to 0.92 g C kg(-1) according to mixing calculations, assuming the two possible SOC sources of S. alterniflora and S. salsa, and accounted for 10.8-18.7% of total SOC in the colonized soils. The estimated accumulative rate of SOC from C-4 (S. alterniflora) was 64.1 C kg(-1) soil year(-1) and from C-3 sources was 78.1 mg C kg(-1). The concentration of S. alterniflora-derived SOC significantly decreased from coarse fraction to fine fraction, and linearly increased as the period of S. alterniflora invasion increased. The highest accumulative rate of SOC from a C-4 source occurred in macroaggregates, while the highest rate from C-3 was in microaggregates. The storage of SOC derived from S. alterniflora in the macroaggregates was 0.27-0.44 g C kg(-1) soil, accounting for 43.1-49.1% of the total C(4)derived SOC in the soil. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion in coastal wetlands could facilitate SOC storage, because of the high potential for accumulation of the C which has been newly derived from S. alterniflora litter and roots.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha-1), to mangrove (46 t ha-1), to seagrass (27 t ha-1) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha-1). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta13C and delta15N mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.","10.1111/gcb.14089","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330966","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042585405&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14089&partnerID=40&md5=ca6b3949132cd145c5ff964e9c7784b3"

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.","10.1007/s10021-021-00660-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330967","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108615887&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00660-6&partnerID=40&md5=3c98333d69e7f9089f95a1f2e2d667bb"

The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.","10.1007/s12237-012-9583-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330983","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876833802&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-012-9583-y&partnerID=40&md5=6683e24a47e46d0221e6fc4f106a2d31"

Recent recognition of the importance of these ecosystems has led to an interest in restoring marshes that have been degraded by human activities. Tidal restriction from coastal development can alter salt marsh plant and animal communities as well as marsh biogeochemistry. However, much less is known about how tidal restriction, and subsequent tidal restoration, may alter greenhouse gas emissions. Since salt marshes typically have lower emissions of methane than freshwater wetlands, tidal restoration that increases the salinity in a restricted marsh could theoretically improve the net global warming potential of a marsh by lowering methane emissions. In this study, we examined the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at four temperate salt marshes, three of which had been restricted and subsequently restored. Greenhouse gas fluxes were poorly correlated with environmental parameters (biomass, temperature, moisture, sediment organic content, porewater salinity and pH, etc.) normally considered to be primary drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical processes. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions and uptake were not influenced by the restriction and restoration history of the marshes. Despite comparable salinity, methane emissions in one partially restored marsh were 25 times higher than those in unimpacted reference sites 13+ years after restoration. However, methane emissions from the other restored sites were equal to or significantly lower than those from unimpacted reference sites. This study highlights that we cannot assume recovering ecosystems will function like unimpacted ones, especially if restoration is incomplete.","10.1002/ecs2.1968","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330986","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039459386&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.1968&partnerID=40&md5=865ea4895cb2a88aeae576975c6c6d2a"

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330988","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266"

Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.","10.1111/ejss.12739","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14330992","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057766567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12739&partnerID=40&md5=4df28dfc6b1509fbc8f6f40a93ef5c62"

However, transfers of allochthonous refractory carbon (C-RF) from the watershed to marshes would not represent new C sequestration. To better understand how refractory carbon (C-RF) inputs affect assessments of marsh age and C sequestration, Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of both total organic carbon (TOC), C-RF, and non-C-RF organic matter fractions were measured in salt marshes from four contrasting systems on the North Atlantic coast. To our knowledge, no salt marsh sediment study has considered refractory or allochthonous carbon in carbon budget calculations or the impact on chronologies. Stable and radiogenic isotope data suggest that while TOC was dominated by autochthonous plant inputs, C-RF was dominated by locally recycled or allochthonous C, the delivery of which was controlled by the size and slope of each watershed. Steep-gradient rivers analyzed delivered Delta C-14-depleted C-RF to their estuarine marshes, while the site located in the low-gradient river was associated with larger C-RF content. Finally, the marsh isolated from riverine input contained the least fraction of TOC as C-RF. Laterally transported C-RF caused only a small offset in Delta C-14 in relation to TOC in low-gradient systems (average Delta C-14 offset was -44.4 and -24.2 parts per thousand at each location). However, the presence of allochthonous Delta C-14-depleted C-RF in sediments of steep-gradient rivers led to large overestimates of the time of organic matter deposition (i.e. apparent age was older than the 'true' time of deposition) (Delta C-14 offset ranged from -170.6 to -528.9 parts per thousand). Further, reliance on TOC or loss on ignition analyses to calculate C sequestration by marshes might produce overestimates of at least as much as 10 to 20% since neither account for the lateral transport of allochthonous carbon.

The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

Ditching was largely abandoned by the mid-twentieth century; however, techniques that create permanent shallow water pools for mosquito control and bird habitat are increasingly being applied to marshes of the USA and elsewhere. Salt marshes in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were used to examine differences between areas that have been ditched and those altered to increase the density of shallow pools in water table dynamics, salinity, soil and porewater chemistry, as well as short-term sedimentation, accretion, and elevation change rates. We found that the area with plugged ditches, berms, and pools in Plum Island had less drainage, higher salinity and porewater sulfide and ammonium concentrations, and higher soil organic matter than the adjacent ditched area. Despite averaging 8 cm lower in elevation, the Plum Island ditched area had less sediment deposition and was composed of higher elevation plant species than the area with plugged ditches, berms, and shallow pools. Elevation increased in the ditched area at a rate of 3.2 +/- A 0.5 mm/year, but elevation change was variable in the area with pools. In Barnegat Bay, the marsh area with pools and ditches had less sediment deposition and surface accretion than the ditch-only area, associated, in part, with the higher elevation. An average elevation difference of 4.5 cm was associated with a sixfold difference in mineral sediment deposition. Temporal sediment deposition and surface accretion was important in the ditch-only area but was absent or muted in the area with numerous pools. Elevation increased in both marsh areas at an average rate of 1.8 +/- A 0.8 mm/year, less than half the long-term average local rate of sea-level rise. Our results illustrate how physical manipulations including changes to tidal hydrology and surface topography interact with elevation to influence short-term biophysical feedbacks.","10.1007/s12237-015-0013-9","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331000","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957436896&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-015-0013-9&partnerID=40&md5=ff20bad7fa0bb8741518556699843616"

Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea-level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Studies on mangrove migration have revealed conflicting results regarding carbon burial, with some suggesting mangrove migration does not increase burial. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr-1) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr-1). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 gC m-2 yr-1) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 gC m-2 yr-1) and salt marsh (4-7 gC m-2 yr-1) sites. Lignin biomarker data (Lambda-6, Lambda-8, C/V) indicated mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol gC-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol gC-1) and lower C/N indicated these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicates this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis. Although carbon burial rates increased with mangrove expansion at the northern Florida sites, questions remained regarding future changes in these wetlands with a warming climate and sea-level rise. To better understand potential future responses of these wetlands, two studies were undertaken using longer sediment cores at the same northern Florida sites to examine the wetlands development over the mid- to late-Holocene. Carbon measurements within 1-3 meter length vibracores yielded total core stocks of 9.8 x 103 - 2.1 x 104 gC m-2 and 7.4 x 103 - 9.5 x 103 gC m-2 for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates down to 1-meter were 6.8 x 103 gC m-2 - 7.3 x 103 gC m-2 and 5.8 x 103 gC m-2 - 8.6 x 103 gC m-2 for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta13C, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines likely experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into former non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following changes in relative sea-level rise and climate. This suggests that not all blue carbon was estimated in the Atlantic coast cores when restricting measurements to the 1-meter benchmark and some carbon deposited in a carbonate-dominant system was included in the 1-meter Gulf coast stocks. Constraining blue carbon measurements to include carbon within 1-meter thus may over- or under-estimate blue carbon stocks. If the natural carbon burying capabilities of these habitats are to be utilized in the future, preservation of regions upslope of wetlands is critical to allow for inland migration in response to ongoing sea-level rise.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331004",NA

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.","10.1111/gcb.15248","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089185406&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.15248&partnerID=40&md5=0a06b229ec01501464fbcdc33a006333"

Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.","10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106584","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077913513&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106584&partnerID=40&md5=e6a1ecd17713d251da68451818868114"

Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.","10.1007/s10482-018-1098-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331043","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047813561&doi=10.1007%2fs10482-018-1098-5&partnerID=40&md5=f04515f4ff03891c061ebcfa37a13b5e"

While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range.

In particular, the environmental characteristics of tidal marshes show are different than those of bare flats, especially in the rhizosphere. However, unlike the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, the rhizosphere of plants in tidal marsh areas and the associated microbial community have been the focus of very little research. Thus, this study investigated the diversity and variation in bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of a Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica and along the sediment depths. High-throughput sequencing was performed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene of environmental DNA extracted from sediment cores, and indicator species were identified with respect to the vegetation type and sediment depth. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes. In general, the results indicated that not only vegetation type and sediment depth themselves but also their interaction resulted in significant differences among the bacterial communities. The envfit results revealed that the environmental variables of sediment, such as mud content, organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The indicator species varied depending on the vegetation type and sediment depth, showing significant correlations with certain selected environmental variables, but were fundamentally related to the rhizosphere. Overall, this study revealed the key factors that determine the bacterial community structure in tidal marshes and the indicator species according to vegetation type in the little studied rhizosphere of the intertidal ecosystem.

A total of 168 Spartina-filled bags trapped 43,531 individuals over 8 sampling dates. Invertebrate abundances differed by season, elevation, cover of Spartina, and marsh type. There were more invertebrates trapped in fall than in winter; there were more in the lower than higher elevation, and in the natural marsh, there were twice as many invertebrates in areas with greater than or equal to 80% cover of Spartina than with less than or equal to 20% cover. The strongest pattern was with marsh type. Natural, fully vegetated marsh had 2-3 times as many individuals as the sparsely-vegetated, 4-year-old constructed marsh. Overall, the most abundant species was a larval dipteran, Pericoma sp., which was up to 9 times more abundant in the natural marsh.

An exploration using ramped pyrolysis","Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands.","10.1002/2015GC005839","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331055","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939571985&doi=10.1002%2f2015GC005839&partnerID=40&md5=05efb0e8962e7cafb086bddfb225baf1"

As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.","10.5194/bg-13-6611-2016","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331063","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006355608&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6611-2016&partnerID=40&md5=7655f8f0776015827d9fb54deb45e299"

Plant and soil fractions were tested for C-13 stable isotopic signatures to elucidate soil C sources. In 3 years, mangrove biomass increased dramatically and soil C doubled in pure salt marsh plots, consequently increasing total C in the system. Soil organic matter increased, while there was no change in soil C:N. C-13 values suggest that soil C was derived mainly from salt marsh soil organic matter, especially that of belowground, rather than aboveground biomass.

Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and reclaimed for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canadas Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

The salt marshes of the East Frisian barrier island Langeoog (NW Germany) belong to the barrier-connected salt marsh type and were protected by a summer dike that was removed in 2004. In this study, pore water and sediment data were combined to investigate the effects of the de-embankment along a transect including sites on seawater-influenced grassland, high and low salt marsh, and transition zone tidal flat-low salt marsh. Pore waters were sampled with in situ pore water samplers for 13 mo and analysed for trace metals (Fe, Mn), nutrients (NH4+, PO43-), dissolved organic carbon, and sulphate. Additionally, on site measurements of pH and salinity were carried out. Pore water ultrafiltration experiments with 5000 Da MWCO (molecular weight cut off) complemented the water analyses. Sediment samples were taken from hammer corings and were analysed for bulk parameters (total carbon [TC], total inorganic carbon [TIC], total organic carbon [TOC], total sulphur [TS]) and selected major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mn). Additionally, reactive iron and manganese were analysed.Sediments along the study transect are characterised by quartz dominance and very low TC (TOC and TIC) and TS contents. The iron content is comparable to other salt marsh sediments. The high percentage of reactive iron (up to 40%) indicates that salt marsh sediments form an important iron source for pore waters, as confirmed by high pore water concentrations of dissolved iron (up to 583 mu M). Dissolved iron in pore waters most likely results from reduction and dissolution of oxidised iron minerals by organic ligands or Fe(II) organic complexes. Iron complexation by humic substances and siderophores in combination with circum-neutral pH values keep iron in solution. Therefore, the studied salt marshes presumably form an important iron reservoir, which may account for elevated pyrite contents frequently observed in Holocene coastal peats.Flooding of the salt marsh during a storm surge resulted in a considerable increase in pore water iron (8-fold), manganese (21-fold), phosphate (5-fold), and ammonia (7-fold) concentrations. These results show that seawater restoration (de-embankment) should be handled very carefully, especially with regard to nutrient release and subsequent changes in pore water quality.","10.2112/08-1053.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331072","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70450182738&doi=10.2112%2f08-1053.1&partnerID=40&md5=086130323a096a13b1c6f73b44a71e98"

Phragmites contributions to soil volume enhances marsh sustainability in the face of sea level rise and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades, but has been little studied on the estuarine portion of the St. Lawrence River. We collected soil cores from Phragmites stand and S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at each Phragmites site. Only bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services. This dataset includes soil carbon and belowground biomass composition data in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh invaded by Phragmites australis. Data were collected in 3 Phragmites sites in 2019 and 1 Spartina patens site in 2014. There are no data in belowgroud biomass composition in S. patens site. Data were collected to estimate the invasive Phragmites contribution to blue carbon stock and soil volume. This dataset contains one Excel file with two sheets (""main data"" and ""diameter""). These data are from field samples and lab analysis. Dry bulk density is calculated by dividing the dry weight by the initial volume. The organic matter content of the ground samples was measured through loss-on-ignition (LOI) with the equation developed by Craft et al. (1991): % organic carbon = 0.40*%LOI + 0.0025(%LOI)2. As much as possible, rhizomes and roots were identified to species using the key of Niering et al. (1977). We used the color and turgor of rhizomes and roots to discern live from dead. Live material is usually light in color and turgid. Dead tissue is dark and flaccid. Unidentified material (mostly roots) was grouped together as other. The volume of each species was determined by placing the entire sample of a species in a graduated cylinder with a known amount of water and measuring the volume of water displaced.

The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of litter decomposition, but could change the dominant pathway.","10.1007/s12237-019-00565-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331078",NA

In this study, the impact of 10 years Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic matter (SOM), labile, and recalcitrant pools was examined comparing with bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities in tidal salt marshes of the Eastern Chinese coast. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly raised C and N concentrations in SOM, labile and recalcitrant pools compared to bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils. Spartina alterniflora soil had higher recalcitrant index for C relative to bare flat. The proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C and the decomposition rate of old C in the labile pool were significantly higher than those in the recalcitrant pool. However, the S. alterniflora-derived C stock of the recalcitrant pool was much greater than that of the labile pool. The SOM and recalcitrant pools in S. alterniflora soil had significantly higher delta N-15 levels compared with bare flat, indicating an increased N loss following S. alterniflora invasion.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities. Overall, our findings highlight the bacterial community succession during the Spartina alterniflora invasion in coastal salt marsh soils, which can provide insight regarding the association between soil development and invasive plant.","10.1007/s00248-019-01430-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331081","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071530664&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-019-01430-7&partnerID=40&md5=bf136b47d8e9ea54da3ae19499998dfd"

In addition, we measured the stable isotopic composition of Pb in order to distinguish its input sources. Concentrations of Pb increased from low or background values in the bottommost layer (<60 cm depth), followed by fluctuations in the middle layer (20-60 cm) and peak values in the subsurface layer (3-5 cm). Pb associated to reactive fractions (e.g. OM, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates) accounted for 60% of that initially deposited. Stable Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-207/Pb-208) suggested that most of the Pb in the upper sediments (1.204 +/- 0.002 and 2.469 +/- 0.007) is still derived from the leaded gasoline combustion (1.201 +/- 0.006 and 2.475 +/- 0.005). Profile of dissolved Pb was related to those for ammonium, phosphates and dissolve Fe and Mn, which reveals the influence of the diagenetic reactions on the Pb behavior. OM. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and the sulfide minerals play a significant role for mobilizing and trapping the Pb. Metal mobilization was calculated considering an advective-diffusive system. The advective process constitutes the dominant mechanism of Pb mobilization. A low diffusive outflux with respect to the Pb mobilization rate suggested that most of the released Pb is retained in the sediments. Authigenic oxides precipitated at the oxic-suboxic layers (0-4 cm depth) and authigenic sulfide minerals formed Pb in the anoxic layers (7-20 cm depth) constituting the main scavengers for Pb that is diagenetically released. This retention has significant environmental implications because it reduces the availability and toxicity of Pb to biota, including humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mean accretion rate over all sites was 3.6 mm yr -1 (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr -1 ), which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate (1.3 mm yr -1 ; sd = 0.6). However, a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr -1 (sd = 1.9) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate. Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate. Lowest accretion rates were recorded at sites with the least sediment supply. Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply. A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine predictions of the effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marshes.

However, the rapid expansion of open water areas has been associated with marsh degradation and there is a growing need for detailed studies as coastal wetlands continue to degrade under increasing rates of sea level rise and related stressors. Yet, few studies investigate soil physicochemical and biogeochemical properties within different marsh landscape features, which could provide insight into mechanisms of the formation and expansion of open water areas. The current study compared wetland soil physical and microbial properties observed in vegetated areas with shallow open water areas called panties, identifying a number of significant differences. Panne soils possessed lower bulk density, total C, N, P, SOC, DOC, and SRP compared with vegetated marsh areas, suggesting a shift in nutrient pools as vegetated areas transition into shallow open water features. Panne features also displayed significantly lower microbial pool sizes and processing rates than vegetated marsh soils, suggesting reduced capacity for nutrient processing in open water areas. Further, extractable NH4-N was highest in the panne soils suggesting that the absence of macrophytes decreased N uptake in open water areas. Also related to the lack of vascular plants, extractable DOC in panties averaged less than half the concentration found in vegetated marsh areas, despite a smaller difference in soil total C. Results underscore the importance of incorporating heterogeneous landscape soil conditions when evaluating marsh degradation and considering potential restoration activities.","10.1016/j.ecss.2018.07.021","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331094",NA

The orientation and size depends primarily on the original purpose of the barrier, but this study examines the effects of berms oriented parallel to the incoming tide such that some landward portion of the marsh receives a different tidal signal than the seaward portion. Our hypotheses considered the impacts of the altered hydrology on pore water chemistry and edaphic characteristics. The results indicate that the effect of berms on salt marsh physical structure varies significantly by site. Where the tidal flooding frequency is restricted and drainage is poor, the landward marsh shows pool development, high salinity and sulfide concentrations, and low vegetation cover. In contrast, where tidal flooding is inhibited but the marsh soils are well-drained, salinity and sulfide concentrations decrease and accelerated decomposition results in subsidence and reduced soil organic matter. Given these findings, impacts from berms may impair salt marsh function and resilience to invasive plants and sea level rise.","10.1007/s11273-013-9309-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331104","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84888437720&doi=10.1007%2fs11273-013-9309-3&partnerID=40&md5=11c3dba9cd649cb0b29444dfa88c8e12"

Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size.

The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora.

Semivariograms for spore density indicated strong spatial autocorrelation and a patchy distribution within both sites for all AM fungal genera found. However, the patch size differed between the two plant communities and AM fungal genera. In the salt marsh, AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with distance to AM plants and projected stand area of AM plants. In maquis, spatial AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with organic matter.

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation.

Here, we document the response of salt marsh fungal communities to long-term excess nitrate in four distinct marsh habitats within a northern temperate marsh complex. We show that salt marsh fungal communities varied as a function of salt marsh habitat, with both fungal abundance and diversity increasing with carbon quantity. Nutrient enrichment altered fungal communities in all habitats through an increase in fungal abundance and the proliferation of putative fungal denitrifiers. Nutrient enrichment also altered marsh carbon quality in low marsh surface sediments where fungal response to nutrient enrichment was most dramatic, suggesting nutrient enrichment can alter organic matter quality in coastal sediments.

Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Increased knowledge about site and vegetation characteristics can contribute to improving their conservation and restoration. A survey of 51 sampling areas and seven transects in the sand dune, salt marsh system of Vallevecchia (Caorle, Italy) was conducted, while taking into account the vegetation and certain important topographical, soil, and hydrological characteristics. The most important factors differentiating the presence of sand dunes and salt marsh vegetation were found to be soil electric conductivity (EC: threshold EC=0.4 mS cm(-1)) and site elevation (threshold + 0.70 cm a.s.l.). In psammophilous vegetation, the soil pH and EC decreased with elevation and the water table was composed of freshwater. A small amount of salt accumulation was found only at the white dune bottom. In salt marsh vegetation, the soils were flooded daily by high tides and were saline and alkaline at higher elevations, where less frequent tide flooding led to frequent soil drying and salt accumulation. The soil OM content of the salt marshes was highest due to the slow mineralization rate as a consequence of the high water content. The current low sediment transport from adjacent rivers was the cause of the regression of the central-eastern part of Vallevecchia, where the dunal system width and number of vegetation types decreased and the height and mean slope of the sea facing sides of the white dunes increased. The 60-cm local sea level rise predicted by 2100 will increase the salt marsh extent by 60%, which will be a disadvantage for the more rare non-saline retro-dunal and psammophilous vegetation. Reactivating river sediment transport, reducing or eliminating the deep-rooted pine and Ammophila arenaria plantations and closing drainage ditches in the adjacent pinewoods can mitigate the negative impacts of sea level rise.

Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Spartina alterniflora releases amines, especially TMA, to salt marsh sediment during decomposition. Benthic animals and phytoplankton also contained high amine concentrations and could be sources of amines to salt marsh sediments either by direct release or during decomposition.MMA, DMA and TMA were present in FP sediment porewaters and solid phases throughout the year. Concentrations generally ranged from 10 nM to 1 mu M in porewaters and 1-100 nmol/g dry wt in the solid phase. DMA dominated the porewater profiles, TMA the exchangeable pool, and MMA the fixed pool of amines. Concentrations varied seasonally with highest concentrations found in the fall when S. alterniflora began to senesce. The C/N ratio of organic matter undergoing decomposition in the sediment was calculated to be 11-12 from the annual sulfate reduction and ammonium and Sigma CO2 production rates.

The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years. There was some evidence that ecosystem gas exchange in created marshes developed slightly faster than aboveground biomass production. Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes. However, carbon mineralization rates per gram soil were relatively low in the created marshes due to lower soil organic matter content.

However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased.

At each salt marsh, samples were taken from a non-vegetated zone and one from each of areas dominated by Halimione portulacoides, Spartina maritima and Arthrocnemum fruticosum. Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher.

The clay assembly of the sediment consists of illite, kaolinite and much less chlorite and smectite. The major clay minerals of illite, kaolinite as well as chlorite correlate very poorly with all the trace metals investigated, due probably to the weak competing strength of these clays compared with the other adsorbents and to low availability of the mobile trace metals in the system. Correlation between trace metals and clay minerals may therefore be used as an indicator in environmental assessment. Fine grain fractions of the sediment increased markedly after salt marsh invasion in about 1931 but decreased after 1964. This increase was contributed mainly by the grains finer than 20 mu m while the fraction of 40-63 mu m actually decreased soon after the invasion. The relation between most of the trace metals and grain size distributions is close in general but far from linear. The drastic turning point is observed at about 30 mu m, around where the correlation coefficient r drops from 0.8 to 0.1. Adsorption is the controlling mechanism for the behavior of trace metals in the salt marsh.

Many factors may contribute to such loss, but among them are geochemical stressors such as exposure of the marsh plants to elevated levels on hydrogen sulfide in the pore water of the marsh peat. Here we report the results of a study of the geochemistry of iron and sulfide at different seasons in unrestored (JoCo) and partially restored (Big Egg) salt marshes in Jamaica Bay, a highly urbanized estuary in New York City where the loss of salt marsh area has accelerated in recent years. The spatial and temporal 2-dimensional distribution patterns of dissolved Fe2+ and H2S in salt marshes were in situ mapped with high resolution planar sensors for the first time. The vertical profiles of Fe2+ and hydrogen sulfide, as well as related solutes and redox potentials in marsh were also evaluated by sampling the pore water at discrete depths. Sediment cores were collected at various seasons and the solid phase Fe, S, N, C, and chromium reducible sulfide in marsh peat at discrete depths were further investigated in order to study Fe and S cycles, and their relationship to the organic matter cycling at different seasons. Our results revealed that the redox sensitive elements Fe2+ and S2- showed significantly heterogeneous and complex three dimensional distribution patterns in salt marsh, over mm to cm scales, directly associated with the plant roots due to the oxygen leakage from roots and redox diagenetic reactions. We hypothesize that the oxic layers with low/undetected H2S and Fe2+ formed around roots help marsh plants to survive in the high levels of H2S by reducing sulfide absorption. The overall concentrations of Fe2+ and H2S and distribution patterns also seasonally varied with temperature change. H2S level in JoCo sampling site could change from 5 mM in fall season, reflecting significantly seasonal variation in the rates of bacterial oxidation of organic matter at this marsh site. Solid phase Fe and S showed that very high fractions of the diagenetically reactive iron at JoCo and Big Egg were associated with pyrite that can persist for long periods in anoxic sediments. This implies that there is insufficient diagenetically reactive iron to buffer the pore water hydrogen sulfide through formation of iron sulfides at JoCo and Big Egg.","10.3389/feart.2021.653698","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331170","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105956286&doi=10.3389%2ffeart.2021.653698&partnerID=40&md5=ec2a94718d35c2efe36733b46cc46aee"

In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

Porewater nutrients, sulfides and alkalinity were much lower in both flooded and drained diked marshes than in the natural marsh.Sediments of the drained marsh had subsided 90 cm relative to the natural site due to organic matter decomposition and compaction. However, despite the loss of organic matter, much of the P and N was retained, with NH4 likely protected from nitrification by low pH and PO4 adsorbed on Fe and Al oxides. Iron, and to a lesser degree sulfur, had also been well retained by the sediment. Despite eight decades of diking, substantial amounts of reduced S, representing potential acidity, persisted near the top of the water table.In contrast, the surface of the seasonally flooded marsh was only 15 cm below the natural marsh. Accretion since diking amounted to 25 cm and involved proportionally less mineral matter.The restoration of seawater flow to both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes will likely extend flooding depth and duration, lower redox, increase cation exchange, and thereby increase NH4, Fe(II), and PO4 mobilization. Increased porewater nutrients could benefit recolonizing halophytes but may also degrade surface water quality.","10.1023/A:1005715520988","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331183","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030621152&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1005715520988&partnerID=40&md5=82628e9390704a555ff40256d0b91969"

Field survey records, tasselled cap transformation, and supervised classification were used for the image interpretation. The results indicate that the plant habitat area decreased by 42.1% over these 10 years. Consequently, the distribution area of each dominant species declined, and the proportion of total vegetated area in the habitat decreased from 53.1% to 32.6%. Moreover, the dominance relations of the species changed fromSpartina alterniflora > Phragmites australis > Cyperus malaccensis > Scirpus triquetertoP. australis > S. alterniflora > C. malaccensis > S. triqueter. We predict that the vegetation landscape in the wetland will be composed exclusively ofP. australisandS. alternifloraif habitat destruction continues.

Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion. This work indicates causal relationships between plant invasions and soil carbon pools and highlights the nonnegligible importance of inorganic C in coastal blue carbon budgets.","10.1016/j.catena.2020.104831","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331186","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089223602&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2020.104831&partnerID=40&md5=c680f5156a3b091d70f2507fb80f7cd5"

West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Two species of cordgrass (Spartina anglica Hubbard and Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) were artificially introduced to the intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province, China, in 1963 and 1982, respectively. However, as alien species, the impact of Spartina on the tidal flat ecosystem remains largely unknown. Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, two native plants in the intertidal zone of northern Jiangsu Province, China, are C3-type plants, whereas the Spartina species are C4-type plants. In this article, we investigate the vertical distribution of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic carbon isotope ratios in different ecosystems associated with the northern Jiangsu tidal flats; analyze changes in the organic carbon sources in the tidal flat sediments after Spartina colonization; compare carbon burial patterns at different evolutionary stages in the tidal flats; and discuss the effects of Spartina on organic carbon cycling over the intertidal flats on the Jiangsu, China, coast. Before the introduction of Spartina, the organic material in the intertidal sediments of the study area mainly came from a combination of marine and C3 plants. After the introduction of Spartina, the contribution of S. alternillora to the organic carbon content in the salt-marsh strata exceeded those made by marine sources and other C3 plants. On the S. anglica flat, the quantity of organic carbon originated from S. anglica was lower than from S. alternillora but was still greater than the contribution made by native C3 plants. The introduction of Spartina not only had a significant effect on primary productivity throughout the tidal flats but also enhanced the organic carbon accumulation rate in the sediment.","10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331187","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863277942&doi=10.2112%2fJCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1&partnerID=40&md5=630e318295408c8c2d7255bb939f6275"

Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.","10.1029/2021GL092420","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331189","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109722078&doi=10.1029%2f2021GL092420&partnerID=40&md5=a9bb42a2aa89b868ce6df525dd9223db"

In this study, we examined the effect of drying on particle size distributions and the rapid (24 h) sorption reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with salt marsh sediments in Nueces Delta, South Texas. Drying reduced the fraction of fine particles in organically richer sediments, indicating structural rearrangement of organic matter and mineral aggregates. Among the 16 EPA priority PAHs examined, dried sediment preferentially released 1.0-7.5% of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene to added seawater (solid: water mass ratio of 1/100)- significantly greater than release from sediments maintained in the wet state. On the other hand, drying also increased the affinity of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) for experimentally amended (deuterated) phenanthrene relative to continually wet sediments. Further, deuterated phenanthrene was even more effectively retained when it was added to wet sediment that was subsequently dried and rewetted.These apparently contradictory results can be reconciled and explained by SOM having a heterogeneous distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones - e.g., a zonal model. We propose that drying changed the orientation of amphiphilic SOM, exposing hydrophobic zones and promoting the release of some of theft native PAHs to water. Freshly amended PAHs were only able to penetrate into the surface hydrophobic zone and/or deeper but rapidly accessible (""kinetics"") zone in wet sediments clue to the brief adsorption contact time. Subsequent drying presumably then induced structural changes in SOM that isolated these amended PAHs in sites inaccessible to water exchange in the next rewetting. These results provide insights into structural changes of SOM upon drying, and help predict the fate of compounds such as organic contaminants during drought/flood oscillations.

Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the Pacific coast of California. The salt marshes studied here contained approximately twice as much OC as did seagrass meadows, 23.51 1.77 kg OC m-3 compared to 11.01 1.18 kg OC m-3, respectively. Both seagrass and salt marsh sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and U.S.-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and C3 salt marsh plants. See manuscript.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates. This study shows that monosaccharides are useful biomarkers to explore the origin of OM in coastal soils. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To mitigate climate change impacts, carbon (C) sequestration has joined established restoration objectives, including habitat diversity, public access, and native vegetation. Changing topography, maintaining trails, and removing invasive plants may influence coastal C production and retention in different ways depending on how each activity influences the stabilization of organic matter in surface sediments. We quantified variation in litter and surface soil dynamics within and between coastal parks that varied in age from prerestoration to nearly 20 years old in Manatee County, Florida. Older parks had deeper soil organic horizons with higher levels of soil moisture and respiration, indicating that restoration sequesters soil C despite increases in microbial efficiency. However, variation within parks indicated that detrital C dynamics change depending on local management objectives. Relative to unmanaged locations, restored wetlands, including mangroves, salt marshes, and freshwater ponds, had soil organic horizons nearly 20 cm deeper, with high litter stabilization rates despite less litter mass and shorter projected soil sample C mineralization. In contrast, public access features like trails and kayak launches were associated with increased surface CO2 efflux and marginally reduced soil organic horizon depth. Removing invasives had little impact on detrital carbon pools and fluxes. Incorporating detrital C dynamics improved a multivariate model for variation in C pool sizes across sites. Overall, our results suggest that management objectives influence the C production and retention capacity of restored coastal habitats with restored uplands and public access points storing less C than relatively inaccessible wetlands.","10.1111/rec.13563","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331201","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118201536&doi=10.1111%2frec.13563&partnerID=40&md5=53f7169658abc2a57a7035f943c6519c"

Sandy sediment dredged from the bed of the Mississippi River was placed at targeted locations in Barataria Bayin an effort to restore and protect coastal Louisiana marshes. This study sought to determine how comparable these dredged river-sediment marsh soils are to those of the surrounding natural marshes in Barataria Bay. Percent organic matter in the created marsh was 11.6% of the natural marsh. Extractable ammonium and extractable nitrate in the created marsh soils were 15.4% and 8.75% of the natural marsh.

We quantified multiple metrics of genetic diversity in the widespread, dominant marsh plant Spartina alterniflora across 3 spatial scales in 16 natural marshes in the Florida Panhandle. We also examined correlations between genetic diversity and marsh plant species diversity, along with key environmental variables that may influence both. Most of the variance in S. alterniflora genetic structure was explained by variation within sampling areas across sites. S. alterniflora genetic diversity and marsh plant species diversity increased with spatial scale within sites. In addition, diversity was generally higher on mainland marsh sites compared to discrete marsh islands, consistent with theoretical predictions from island biogeography and population genetics. Multiple metrics of genetic diversity increased with island area and with distance to the mainland. Despite significant correlations between diversity and tidal height, sediment organic content, and sediment porewater salinity, site type (mainland or island) and spatial scale were the best predictors of S. alterniflora genetic and marsh plant species diversity.

In sediments, we measured metal and metalloid concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) and SEM-AVS (Simultaneously extracted metal-acid volatile sulfides). In five different functional feeding groups of biota, we measured metal concentrations and delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures.

There were positive relationships between biota Hg concentrations and sediment concentrations, and between biota MeHg concentrations and both pelagic feeding mode and trophic level.

Although edge: area comparisons cannot detect certain types of differences in geomorphology, comparisons clearly show that dredged material marshes, on average, have fewer ponds and flooded depressions than natural marshes. Comparisons of relative exposure index values suggest that wave protection structures associated with some dredged material marshes may be overbuilt. Elevation profiles illustrate the potential for structures such as berms to lead to differences between dredged material marshes and natural marshes, but they also show the high variability in elevation profiles that exists among both dredged material and natural marshes. S. alterniflora elevations in dredged material marshes are not significantly different from those of natural marshes. Soil organic carbon and silt-clay content of dredged material marshes are not significantly different from those of natural marshes. Although belowground biomass of dredged material marshes is significantly lower than that of natural marshes, regression analysis suggests that belowground biomass will increase over time. Findings reported here suggest several points that should be considered during planning and design of dredged material marshes in Texas: 1) if an objective of marsh construction is to mimic natural marsh geomorphology, methods to increase the amount of unconnected edge need to be developed, 2) methods of effectively summarizing geomorphic characteristics need further development, and 3) there is some evidence suggesting that protective structures may be over-built, and the need for substantial structural protection should be balanced against the costs of structures and risk of site failure during project design.

Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter.

The highest values of sediment water content (40-60%) and electrical conductivity (20-30 mS cm(-1)) were registered in low middle marshes, the highest organic matter content (ca. 23%) was found in middle marshes, and the highest pH (8.5-9.0) was recorded in high marshes. The conductivity and the pH of the marsh sediments changed seasonally. The sediment conductivity reached its highest values during spring and summer. The spatial variations in the sedimentary environment were closely associated with the distribution of most of the recorded halophytes, especially in low and high marshes where the abiotic environment was more stressful. At the same time, cyclical seasonal changes in conductivity seemed to determine the distribution of the halophytes in high marshes, where the seasonality was very marked under Mediterranean climate. The combination and integration over time of these spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment defined habitats with contrasted abiotic conditions parallel to the tidal line and complex abiotic mosaics inside some of these habitats, allowing the cohabitation of > 30 plant species along the intertidal gradient.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.05.037","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331224","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020741058&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2017.05.037&partnerID=40&md5=c51dc259519248c675316d2325babfe5"

Nineteen samples were processed following the standard methodology for palynological studies. Organic matter (OM) content was measured in the sediments. The age model was established according to O-18 isotopes analyses in benthic foraminiferal tests. The studied interval corresponds to a glacial interval, divided in palynozones (PZs): PZIa (66.5-64.5 kyr), PZIb (64.5-53.5 kyr), and PZII (53.5-47 kyr). PZIa was characterized by drier conditions, with grassland and salt marsh taxa dominance (Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae). During PZIb and PZII, the increase of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Araucaria angustifolia, Arecaceae, and Alchornea triplinervia points to wetter and warmer conditions that may be related to the beginning of marine isotope stage 3 and later to the sea-level rise. In the oceanic environment, the presence of freshwater algae and marine indicators lead to the conclusion that marine conditions prevailed during Rio Grande Cone sedimentary formation, even under low sea-level conditions when terrigenous influence was stronger. The data on OM content, dinoflagellate taxa, and mean sea level changes point to a period of low productivity during PZI. In PZII, a period of higher productivity took place because of Subantarctic Shelf Water influence, bringing cold and nutrient-rich waters to the area.","10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00074.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331232","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096027479&doi=10.2112%2fJCOASTRES-D-19-00074.1&partnerID=40&md5=4d422271f7ee5c658cd3a3279426452d"

The upper 0-100 cm sediment profile was sampled in three reedbeds at 56, 94, and 131 km from the river mouth. Sampling was repeated five times, at approximately two month intervals. Sediment properties such as texture and chloride, carbonate and organic matter content differed among locations. Metal accumulation, which is primarily due to association of metals with organic matter and clay in the surface sediment layer, seemed to be supplemented by an accumulation of sulphide precipitates deeper in the sediments. The depth at which sulphide precipitation significantly contributed to metal accumulation depended on the sampling location, and varied from less than 5 cm in clayey, organic sediments to more than 1 m in sandy sediments. Temporal variation of Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations could only be linked to newly formed sulphides or sulphide oxidation at the sites with the lowest sulphide content. At sampling sites containing high sulphide amounts, variations should be primarily attributed to metal exchange and the presence of mobile metal complexes. Litter decomposition at the end of the growing season could hereby play a significant role.","10.1672/07-103.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331244",NA

Species richness, abundance and biomass of macrobenthos across 5 different sub-habitats (seaward, middle, and landward parts of open water unvegetated areas, and Phragmites- and Kandelia-dominated, vegetated areas) within the pond were examined bimonthly between January 1997 and January 1998. Grab samples were collected randomly within the sub-habitats. Key physical environmental parameters of the sampling sites were also measured. A total of 46 species of macrobenthos was recorded: 11 polychaetes, 11 molluscs, 13 crustaceans and 11 insects. Mean species density in the five sub-habitats ranged from 0 to 3907 ind.m(-2), with mean biomass ranging from 0 to 96.9 g.m(-2). The macrobenthos showed spatial and temporal differences among the sub-habitats and across sampling times. Species abundances of Polychaeta, Mollusca and Crustacea were significantly higher in the three open water areas than in the two vegetated ( Phragmites- and Kandelia-dominated) areas, with an inverse pattern for Insecta. There were no clear temporal patterns although abundance and biomass generally increased in the cooler months. Results of a canonical correspondence analysis suggest that macrobenthic species richness, abundance and biomass in the open areas were positively correlated with salinity, while water depth, dissolved oxygen and sediment organic matter content had little relationship with the macrobenthic assemblage parameters. Ordination by multi-dimensional scaling suggests that different habitats supported distinct macrobenthic assemblages. The macrobenthic assemblage in the tidal pond was less species rich but denser than those in the neighboring tidal mangrove and mudflat, suggesting that conversion of these areas into extensively managed tidal aquaculture ponds results in reduced species richness in tropical mangrove habitats.","10.1023/A:1015281114542","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331256",NA

The current study aims to detect anatomical adaptation to stress factors in different organs of the D.tortuosa plant (salinity, and drought). The plant was collected in Egypt from 17 different locations representing seven different habitats (sand dunes, sand flats, salt marshes, wadi bed & slope, roadsides and cultivated lands). The effect of soil factors (soil texture, pH, EC, and organic matter) on the anatomical features of various plant organs (root, stem, and leaf) was investigated. Variations in plant anatomical features were observed in response to significant differences in soil parameters (EC, organic carbon, and ionic content) between desert habitats. According to CCA analysis, periderm thickness is correlated with changes in ion concentrations (Ca+2, K+, and Na+), whereas cortex width is correlated with changes in pH and organic matter content in roots. Meanwhile, the degree of salinity in the habitats is correlated with sclerification in the stem and the widest chlorenchyma cells. Thick epidermis and a large xylem area are required for salt excretion in leaf development, and water conservation is related to changes in moisture content. Reducing plant water loss in the studied desert habitats could explain D. tortuosa's successful growth and survival under such harsh conditions.","10.21608/ejbo.2021.41821.1554","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331259",NA

These expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error [SE]: 0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 %), or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on autochthonous soil development. In the highly disturbed region of Fourchon, Louisiana, the shift from Spartina marshes to scrub Avicennia stands does not appear to affect the chemistry of soil development.","10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00184.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331271","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889673248&doi=10.2112%2fJCOASTRES-D-12-00184.1&partnerID=40&md5=9a6f52aa57388eb9af9c80e58bac384b"

Environmental concentrations of metals in estuarine sediments are often higher than natural backgrounds, but show no contiguity to potential sources. Thus, better understanding the metal mobility in estuaries is essential to improve identification of pollution sources and their accountability for environmental effects. This study aims to identify the key biogeochemical drivers of metal mobilisation on contaminated estuarine sediments through 91) evaluation of the potential mobilisation under controlled conditions, and 92) investigation of the relevance of metal mobilisation for in situ pollution levels in an area with multiple contaminant sources. Sediments from a saltmarsh adjacent to a coastal landfill, a marina, and a shipyard on the Thames Estuary (Essex, UK) were exposed in the laboratory 924 h, N = 96, 20 degrees C) to water under various salinity, pH, and redox potential. Major cations, Fe(II), and trace metal concentrations were analysed in the leachate and sediment. Salinity, pH and redox had a significant effect on metal mobilisation (p < 0.001), e.g. under certain conditions Fe(II) leaching was increased similar to 1000-fold. Measurements in situ of surface and subsurface sediment cores revealed that landfill proximity poorly explained metal spatial distribution. However, physicochemical parameters explained up to 97% of geochemically normalized metal concentrations in sediments. Organic matter and pH were dominant factors for most of the metal concentrations at the sediment surface. At subsurface, major cations (Ca, Na, Mg and K) were determinant predictors of metal concentrations. Applying the empirical model obtained in the laboratory to geochemical conditions of the studied saltmarsh it was possible to demonstrate that Fe mobilisation regulates the fate of this (and other) metal in that area. Thus, present results highlight the importance of metal mobility to control sediment pollution and estuarine fate of metals. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of this work were to identify the consequences of plant invasion on C and N dynamics in soil organic matter (SOM) and its fractions following invasion chronosequence. In this study, we investigated the soil C and N contents and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the SOM, free light fraction (LF), infra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) in invasive 6-, 10-, 17- and 20-year-old Spartina alterniflora communities and compared with bare flat land in a coastal wetland of eastern China. S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora. The decay rate of old C decreased and the mean residence time of C increased in SOM and its fractions following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The delta N-15 values of soil under S. alterniflora were more enriched than were those in bare flat land, whereas the delta N-15 values depleted following invasion chronosequence. Our results show that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered SOC dynamics following invasion chronosequence by changing C physical distribution in SOM, S. alterniflora-derived C input and C decomposition, ultimately having a greater impact on SOC incorporation relative to SON accumulation in a coastal wetland of eastern China.","10.1016/j.catena.2017.03.021","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331278",NA

M.","2013","Ecological tradeoffs of stabilized salt marshes as a shoreline protection strategy: Effects of artificial structures on macrobenthic assemblages","Armoring shorelines to prevent erosion is a long-standing global practice that has well-documented adverse effects on coastal habitats and organisms. A relatively new form of shoreline protection, referred to as hybrid stabilization, incorporates created marsh in combination with a stabilizing structure such as a low-profile stone sill and is being implemented in many US coastal states as a means to not only control erosion but also to restore coastal habitat. However, there has been limited scientific investigation of ecological benefits and impacts associated with implementation of hybrid stabilization. We evaluated relative habitat capacity of marsh-sills by comparing plant, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrate attributes in intertidal and subtidal zones of existing marsh-sills, natural marshes, tidal flats, and riprap revetment within two subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Low and high marsh plant characteristics (stem count and height) of marsh-sills were similar to or greater than natural marshes. However, sediment was coarser, total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were lower, and benthic macrofaunal community structure differed in marsh-sills compared to natural marshes. Marsh-sills supported lower deposit-feeding infaunal biomass than marshes in the intertidal. Epifaunal suspension-feeders were most prevalent at sites with artificial structure (riprap and marsh-sill), but highly variable among subestuaries. Infaunal abundance, biomass, diversity, and proportion of suspension/interface and deposit feeding animals were greater in shallow subtidal than in intertidal environments. Conversion of existing habitat to marsh-sills may cause localized loss of benthic productivity and sediment bioturbation and nutrient-cycling functions, with the opportunity to enhance filtration capacity by epifaunal recruitment to structures. When creating marshes that require structural support, there should be a balance of minimizing loss of existing habitats while encouraging use of suitable structural habitat for suspension-feeders. If properly implemented, the addition of structural habitat could subsidize secondary productivity particularly in areas where loss of complex biogenic habitat (e.g., oyster reefs) has occurred.

We compared our diatom dataset (320 species from 104 samples) to a series of environmental variables (elevation, grain-size, total organic carbon (TOCSOM), and porewater salinity) using hierarchical clustering and ordination. While no single variable consistently explains variations in diatom assemblages at every site, elevation, salinity, and substrate (mud fraction and (TOCSOM) are variables affecting diatom distribution along our transects. Elevation was the major environmental control of diatom variability (explained 27-39% variance) at four transects (Bone River Transect 1, Niawiakum River Transect 2, Naselle River Transect 1 and 2).

Both species are deposit feeders, and represent the dominant crab species in the study area. S. globosa was found to occur within sandy sediment habitats on the tidal flat, while I. pusilla occurred in both muddy sediment on the tidal flat and salt marsh habitats. This study was the first to detect cellulase activity in dotillid crabs. Cellulase activity was detected for both species; I. pusilla was found to exhibit significantly higher activity than S. globosa. Organic matter content, which is known to have a strong positive correlation with the cellulose content of sediments in estuarine areas, was higher in the sediments of muddy and salt marsh habitats compared with those in sandy habitats. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the habitat segregation of these two crabs and their cellulase activity. Given that cellulose is abundant in refractory organic materials and is a major component of food resources in tidal flat sediments, it is likely that these two crab species, especially I. pusilla, would play an important role in material cycling in tidal flat and estuarine areas.

Subtidal and intertidal sediments and primary producers were both sampled in April 2009. Their elemental and isotopic compositions were assessed. Relative contributions of each source to SOM were estimated using a mixing model. The SOM composition tended to be homogeneous over the whole ecosystem and reflected the high diversity of primary producers in this system. On average, SOM was composed of 25% of decayed phanerogams, 19% of microphytobenthos, 20% of phytoplankton, 19% of river SPOM and 17% of macroalgae.

Here we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to above-ground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, above-ground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important trade-off with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, above-ground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of below-ground biomass as the root to shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation.

Green beach vegetation can develop on nutrient-poor beaches landward from embryo dunes. It is characterised by low-dynamic coastal wetland habitat such as salt marshes and dune slacks. It has been hypothesised that the establishment of green beach vegetation is facilitated by the shelter provided by embryo dunes, however evidence is lacking.We explored the importance of geomorphology and soil conditions on the species richness and turnover of green beach vegetation over a time period of 10 years. We recorded 107 plots along 11 transects over a gradient from beach to dune on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. We characterised transect geomorphology at transect level and soil conditions and vegetation at plot level in 2006 and 2016.We found that the green beach vegetation was highly dynamic, total plant cover increased by 62% within 10 years. In 2006 beach width was an important factor in explaining species richness, with the highest number of species occurring on narrow beaches with a large volume of embryo dunes. In 2016, species richness was positively associated with the build-up of organic matter. Overall species richness declined relative to 2006 and was accompanied by an increase in elevation due to sand burial and the expansion of embryo dune volume.Our data suggests that geomorphology influenced the vegetation indirectly by affecting sand burial rate. Plant species richness declined less at sheltered conditions where sand burial was limited, allowing the build-up of organic matter. This indicates a time-dependent relationship between the development of embryo dunes and plant species richness: embryo dunes can be a source of shelter, thus increasing species richness, but can compete for space over time, lowering species richness again. Our results are relevant for engineering and management of biodiverse sandy shores. (C) 2021 The Authors.

This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the ""MIRACLE"" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some ""memory"" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg ""trapped"" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

"GEN",14331303,"Lewis, David Bruce","2021","Florida mangrove saltmarsh reference surface soils","Site description. This data package consists of data obtained from sampling surface soil (the 0-7.6 cm depth profile) in black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forest and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) saltmarsh along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in peninsular west-central Florida, USA. This location has a subtropical climate with mean daily temperatures ranging from 15.4 °C in January to 27.8 °C in August, and annual precipitation of 1336 mm. Precipitation falls as rain primarily between June and September. Tides are semi-diurnal, with 0.57 m median amplitudes during the year preceding sampling (U.S. NOAA National Ocean Service, Clearwater Beach, Florida, station 8726724). Sea-level rise is 4.0 0.6 mm per year (1973-2020 trend, mean 95 % confidence interval, NOAA NOS Clearwater Beach station). The A. germinans mangrove zone is either adjacent to water or fringed on the seaward side by a narrow band of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). A near-monoculture of J. roemerianus is often adjacent to and immediately landward of the A. germinans zone. The transition from the mangrove to the J. roemerianus zone is variable in our study area. An abrupt edge between closed-canopy mangrove and J. roemerianus monoculture may extend for up to several hundred meters in some locations, while other stretches of ecotone present a gradual transition where smaller, widely spaced trees are interspersed into the herbaceous marsh. Juncus roemerianus then extends landward to a high marsh patchwork of succulent halophytes (including Salicornia bigellovi, Sesuvium sp., and Batis maritima), scattered dwarf mangrove, and salt pans, followed in turn by upland vegetation that includes Pinus sp. and Serenoa repens. Field design and sample collection. We established three study sites spaced at approximately 5 km intervals along the western coastline of the central Florida peninsula. The sites consisted of the Salt Springs (28.3298°, -82.7274°), Energy Marine Center (28.2903°, -82.7278°), and Green Key (28.2530°, -82.7496°) sites on the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Pasco County, Florida, USA. At each site, we established three plot pairs, each consisting of one saltmarsh plot and one mangrove plot. Plots were 50 m^2 in size. Plots pairs within a site were separated by 230-1070 m, and the mangrove and saltmarsh plots composing a pair were 70-170 m apart. All plot pairs consisted of directly adjacent patches of mangrove forest and J. roemerianus saltmarsh, with the mangrove forests exhibiting a closed canopy and a tree architecture (height 4-6 m, crown width 1.5-3 m). Mangrove plots were located at approximately the midpoint between the seaward edge (water-mangrove interface) and landward edge (mangrove-marsh interface) of the mangrove zone. Saltmarsh plots were located 20-25 m away from any mangrove trees and into the J. roemerianus zone (i.e., landward from the mangrove-marsh interface). Plot pairs were coarsely similar in geomorphic setting, as all were located on the Gulf of Mexico coastline, rather than within major sheltering formations like Tampa Bay, and all plot pairs fit the tide-dominated domain of the Woodroffe classification (Woodroffe, 2002, ""Coasts: Form, Process and Evolution"", Cambridge University Press), given their conspicuous semi-diurnal tides. There was nevertheless some geomorphic variation, as some plot pairs were directly open to the Gulf of Mexico while others sat behind keys and spits or along small tidal creeks. Our use of a plot-pair approach is intended to control for this geomorphic variation. Plot center elevations (cm above mean sea level, NAVD 88) were estimated by overlaying the plot locations determined with a global positioning system (Garmin GPS 60, Olathe, KS, USA) on a LiDAR-derived bare-earth digital elevation model (Dewberry, Inc., 2019). The digital elevation model had a vertical accuracy of 10 cm (95 % CI) and a horizontal accuracy of 116 cm (95 % CI). Soil samples were collected via coring at low tide in June 2011. From each plot, we collected a composite soil sample consisting of three discrete 5.1 cm diameter soil cores taken at equidistant points to 7.6 cm depth. Cores were taken by tapping a sleeve into the soil until its top was flush with the soil surface, sliding a hand under the core, and lifting it up. Cores were then capped and transferred on ice to our laboratory at the University of South Florida (Tampa, Florida, USA), where they were combined in plastic zipper bags, and homogenized by hand into plot-level composite samples on the day they were collected. A damp soil subsample was immediately taken from each composite sample to initiate 1 y incubations for determination of active C and N (see below). The remainder of each composite sample was then placed in a drying oven (60 °C) for 1 week with frequent mixing of the soil to prevent aggregation and liberate water. Organic wetland soils are sometimes dried at 70 °C, however high drying temperatures can volatilize non-water liquids and oxidize and decompose organic matter, so 50 °C is also a common drying temperature for organic soils (Gardner 1986, ""Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 1"", Soil Science Society of America); we accordingly chose 60 °C as a compromise between sufficient water removal and avoidance of non-water mass loss. Bulk density was determined as soil dry mass per core volume (adding back the dry mass equivalent of the damp subsample removed prior to drying). Dried subsamples were obtained for determination of soil organic matter (SOM), mineral texture composition, and extractable and total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) within the following week. Sample analyses. A dried subsample was apportioned from each composite sample to determine SOM as mass loss on ignition at 550 °C for 4 h. After organic matter was removed from soil via ignition, mineral particle size composition was determined using a combination of wet sieving and density separation in 49 mM (3 %) sodium hexametaphosphate ((NaPO_3)_6) following procedures in Kettler et al. (2001, Soil Science Society of America Journal 65, 849-852). The percentage of dry soil mass composed of silt and clay particles (hereafter, fines) was calculated as the mass lost from dispersed mineral soil after sieving (0.053 mm mesh sieve). Fines could have been slightly underestimated if any clay particles were burned off during the preceding ignition of soil. An additional subsample was taken from each composite sample to determine extractable N and organic C concentrations via 0.5 M potassium sulfate (K_2SO_4) extractions. We combined soil and extractant (ratio of 1 g dry soil:5 mL extractant) in plastic bottles, reciprocally shook the slurry for 1 h at 120 rpm, and then gravity filtered it through Fisher G6 (1.6 mum pore size) glass fiber filters, followed by colorimetric detection of nitrite (NO_2^-) + nitrate (NO_3^-) and ammonium (NH_4^+) in the filtrate (Hood Nowotny et al., 2010,Soil Science Society of America Journal 74, 1018-1027) using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek Epoch, Winooski, VT, USA). Filtrate was also analyzed for dissolved organic C (referred to hereafter as extractable organic C) and total dissolved N via combustion and oxidation followed by detection of the evolved CO_2 and N oxide gases on a Formacs HT TOC/TN analyzer (Skalar, Breda, The Netherlands). Extractable organic N was then computed as total dissolved N in filtrate minus extractable mineral N (itself the sum of extractable NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N). We determined soil total C and N from dried, milled subsamples subjected to elemental analysis (ECS 4010, Costech, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) at the University of South Florida Stable Isotope Laboratory. Median concentration of inorganic C in unvegetated surface soil at our sites is 0.5 % of soil mass (Anderson, 2019, Univ. of South Florida M.S. thesis via methods in Wang et al., 2011, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment 174, 241-257). Inorganic C concentrations are likely even lower in our samples from under vegetation, where organic matter would dilute the contribution of inorganic C to soil mass. Nevertheless, the presence of a small inorganic C pool in our soils may be counted in the total C values we report. Extractable organic C is necessarily of organic C origin given the method (sparging with HCl) used in detection. Active C and N represent the fractions of organic C and N that are mineralizable by soil microorganisms under aerobic conditions in long-term soil incubations. To quantify active C and N, 60 g of field-moist soil were apportioned from each composite sample, placed in a filtration apparatus, and incubated in the dark at 25 °C and field capacity moisture for 365 d (as in Lewis et al., 2014, Ecosphere 5, art59). Moisture levels were maintained by frequently weighing incubated soil and wetting them up to target mass. Daily CO_2 flux was quantified on 29 occasions at 0.5-3 week intervals during the incubation period (with shorter intervals earlier in the incubation), and these per day flux rates were integrated over the 365 d period to compute an estimate of active C. Observations of per day flux were made by sealing samples overnight in airtight chambers fitted with septa and quantifying headspace CO_2 accumulation by injecting headspace samples (obtained through the septa via needle and syringe) into an infrared gas analyzer (PP Systems EGM 4, Amesbury, MA, USA). To estimate active N, each incubated sample was leached with a C and N free, 35 psu solution containing micronutrients (Nadelhoffer, 1990, Soil Science Society of America Journal 54, 411-415) on 19 occasions at increasing 1-6 week intervals during the 365 d incubation, and then extracted in 0.5 M K_2SO_4 at the end of the incubation in order to remove any residual mineral N. Active N was then quantified as the total mass of mineral N leached and extracted. Mineral N in leached and extracted solutions was detected as NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N via colorimetry as above. This incubation technique precludes new C and N inputs and persistently leaches mineral N, forcing microorganisms to meet demand by mineralizing existing pools, and thereby directly assays the potential activity of soil organic C and N pools present at the time of soil sampling. Because this analysis commences with disrupting soil physical structure, it is biased toward higher estimates of active fractions. Calculations. Non-mobile C and N fractions were computed as total C and N concentrations minus the extractable and active fractions of each element. This data package reports surface-soil constituents (moisture, fines, SOM, and C and N pools and fractions) in both gravimetric units (mass constituent / mass soil) and areal units (mass constituent / soil surface area integrated through 7.6 cm soil depth, the depth of sampling). Areal concentrations were computed as X * D * 7.6, where X is the gravimetric concentration of a soil constituent, D is soil bulk density (g dry soil / cm^3), and 7.6 is the sampling depth in cm.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331303",NA

A.; Giarrizzo, T.","2016","Evidence for habitat-driven segregation of an estuarine fish assemblage","This study examined the spatio-temporal variability in fish assemblage structure and composition following monthly sampling (August 2006 to July 2007). Three estuarine zones (upper, middle and lower) of the unvegetated intertidal and subtidal channel habitats located in the Marapanim Estuary were investigated. In each of these zones, salinity, organic matter and sediment types were measured to assess any correlation between habitat types and the fish fauna. A total of 41 496 fishes, belonging to 76 species and 29 families, was recorded. Recurring changes in both species composition and trophic structure were attributed to seasonal variations, while habitat type played a more permanent role in modifying the structure of fish assemblages. Zooplanktivores (e.g. Lycengraulis grossidens) and herbivores (e.g. Cetengraulis edentulus) used the intertidal habitat almost exclusively and were associated with salinity and substratum composition (gravel, silt and mud). In contrast, benthophages (e.g. Cathorops spixii) and benthophage-ichthyophages (e.g. Cynoscion leiarchus) were primarily associated with the subtidal habitat throughout the estuary and were highly related to the presence of sandy substrata. This study highlighted the intricate roles that local factors (such as habitat connectivity) may have on the distribution of fishes at the assemblage level. As such, incorporating habitat sharing or segregation between species should be viewed as essential for any comparisons of estuaries over large geographic scales, and in particular for conservation planning and management measures.

In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of C, N and S of both soil and (native and invasive) plants in four typical coastal wetlands in the core area of the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The results show that the invasive S. alterniflora greatly influenced soil properties and increased soil C, N and S storage capacity: the stock (mean +/- standard error) of soil organic carbon (SOC, (3.56 +/- 0.36) kg/m(3)), total nitrogen (TN, (0.43 +/- 0.02) kg/m(3)), and total sulfur (TS, (0.69 +/- 0.11) kg/m(3)) in the S. alterniflora marsh exceeded those in the adjacent bare mudflat, Suaeda salsa marsh, and Phragmites australis marsh. Because of its greater biomass, plant C ((1193.7 +/- 133.6) g/m(2)), N ((18.8 +/- 2.4) g/m(2)), and S ((9.4 +/- 1.5) g/m(2)) storage of S. alterniflora was also larger than those of co-occurring native plants. More biogenic elements circulated in the soil-plant system of the S. alterniflora marsh, and their spatial and temporal distribution patterns were also changed by the S. alterniflora invasion. Soil properties changed by S. alterniflora's invasion thereby indirectly affected the accumulation of soil C, N and S in this wetland ecosystem. The SOC, TN, and TS contents were positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and moisture, but negatively correlated with the pH and bulk density of soil. Together, these results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion altered ecosystem processes, resulted in changes in net primary production and litter decomposition, and increased the soil C, N and S storage capacity in the invaded ecosystems in comparison to those with native tallgrass communities in the coastal wetlands of East China.","10.1007/s11769-020-1108-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331317",NA

Mineralization products of early diagenetic processes accumulate in the pore waters of the sediment, are subject of biological uptake and secondary biogeochemical processes and are released back into the water column via advective and diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Seven representative sites in the shallow coastal area of the southern Baltic Sea (15-45 m water depth), ranging from permeable sands to fine grained muds, were investigated on a seasonal basis for their key mineralization processes as well as their solid phase and pore water composition to identify the drivers for the variability of early diagenetic processes in the different sediment types. The sandy sediments showed about one order of magnitude lower organic carbon contents compared to the muds, while oxygen uptake rates were similar in both sediment types. Significantly higher oxygen uptake rates were determined in two near-shore muddy sites than in a deeper coastal muddy basin, which is due to higher nutrient loads and the corresponding addition of fresh algal organic matter in the near-shore sites. Pore water concentration profiles in the studied sediments were usually characterized by a typical biogeochemical zonation with oxic, suboxic, and sulfidic zones. An up to 15 cm thick suboxic zone was sustained by downward transport of oxidized material in which dissolved iron and phosphate indicate an intensive reduction of reactive Fe with the release of adsorbed phosphorus. While the geochemical zonation was stable over time in the muds of the studied deeper basin, high variability was observed in the muds of a near-coastal bay probably mainly controlled by sediment mixing activities. The sediments can be characterized by essentially two factors based on their near-surface benthic solute reservoirs: (1) their organic matter mineralization and solute accumulation efficiency and (2) their redox-state. Benthic solute reservoirs in the pore waters of the top decimeter were generally higher in the muddy than in the sandy sediments as the more permeable sands were prone to an intensive exchange between pore water and bottom water. The three studied muddy sites showed great dissimilarities with respect to their predominating redox-sensitive metabolites (dissolved iron, manganese, and sulfide). Surface-near advective transport like irrigation of permeable sands and rearrangement of cohesive muds had a particularly strong influence on early diagenetic processes in the studied sediments and were probably the most important cause for the spatiotemporal variability of their benthic solute reservoirs.","10.3389/fmars.2018.00413","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331318",NA

In this study the distribution of water extractable soil nutrients and water mobile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its bioavailability were investigated at specific levels along a cross-sectional gradient that extended from the baseflow level deep in the channel to the floodplain. The frequency with which these specific levels are inundated was modelled under three flow regimes to determine if flow change is likely to influence nutrient supply to the river. Soil surface litter and soil organic carbon content, DOC and SRP increased along a trajectory from the base of the channel onto the floodplain. Ammonium increased and nitrate decreased as in-channel height decreased. This reflects an increase in soil inundation frequency lower in the channel decreasing nitrification rates and increasing NO3- losses via mobilisation and denitrification. Bioavailable soil DOC (BDOC) was lowest in the most frequently inundated soils; however, overall soil BDOC did not relate to either changing soil properties or inundation frequency. There were no significant differences in nutrient and carbon supply to the river under the three modelled flow regimes (with flows extraction rules, without flow extraction rules and natural flows) explored as flow change was most marked in the channel bed region, where little organic matter was stored.

Here, we estimate soil, pore water, and surface-water carbon fluxes in an Australian estuarine tidal creek to assess whether (1) advective pore water exchange releases some of the soil carbon, (2) outwelling (lateral exports) represents a major carbon sequestration mechanism, and (3) methane emissions offset soil carbon sequestration. A radon (Rn-222) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 +/- 3.6 to 15.6 +/- 8.1 cm d(-1). Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. Organic carbon burial in soils derived from Pu239 + 240 dating was 11-63 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Methane and carbon dioxide emissions at the water-air interface were 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 63 +/- 166 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. When calculated as CO2-equivalents, aquatic CH4 emissions converted to 19-94 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset < 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) catchment d(-1)) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial. Because much of this DIC remains in the ocean after air-water equilibration, lateral DIC exports may represent an important long-term carbon sink. Recent research has focused on quantifying carbon burial rates in blue carbon habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves. We suggest that DIC outwelling and methane outgassing should also be considered when assessing the carbon sequestration capacity of these coastal vegetated habitats.","10.1002/lno.11090","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331324","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063749394&doi=10.1002%2flno.11090&partnerID=40&md5=4344261933ad30003a5c5345d86dd4d0"

The pH and Eh were measured in sediments, while dissolved nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate) and particulate organic matter (POM) were determined in pore water. pH (6.2-8.7) was only affected by vegetation in low areas. Eh (from 300 to 250 mV) was lower at low sites than at high ones; in the latter, the values were higher in the non-vegetated sediments. The POM concentration was greater in the high marsh than in the low marsh, with no effect of vegetation. Ammonium was the most abundant nitrogen nutrient species in pore water, except in the non-vegetated high marsh where nitrate concentration was higher. All nitrogen nutrients were affected by both flooding and vegetation. Phosphate was always present in pore water at all sites throughout the year and its concentration varied within narrow limits, with no effect of flooding and greater values always at non-vegetated sites. Our results showed that the variability of the pore water composition within the marsh is greater than the temporal variation, meaning that both tidal flooding and vegetation are important in the dynamics of nutrients and organic matter in the sediment pore water.","10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60395-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331326","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79551665771&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2810%2960395-6&partnerID=40&md5=bb5c73919f12868addc290efa7466348"

The 12,923 individuals picked were assigned to forty-seven species. The analysis of the foraminiferal percentages allows the distinction of seven assemblages: two salt marsh assemblages (Trochammina inflata and Jadammina macrescens), four assemblages widely represented both in the channel margins and the channels (Ammonia inflata Astrononion stelligerum, Cribroelphidium vadescens, Ammonia ammoniformis) and one marginal marine assemblage (Ammonia beccarii-Quinqueloculina spp). The distribution of these assemblages is controlled by the salinity, the altitude above the lowest tidal level and, to a lesser extent, by the grain size, organic matter and the test transport. In the Tinto-Odiel estuary, both effects of heavy metal pollution and sedimentary changes in the foraminiferal distribution were analyzed, indicating some recuperation mainly in the Odiel river, one of the most polluted areas of the world.

Average sediment concentrations ranged from 62 to 764 mu g/g for Zn, 20-52 mu g/g for Cu, 27-311 mu g/g for Pb and 0.45-1.90 mu g/g for Cd across estuaries. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, with the Hunter River estuary and Sydney Olympic Park exhibiting intermediate levels of sediment metal contamination. Bioconcentration factors for metal uptake from sediment to roots were >= 1 (except for Cu). Translocation within the plant was low for most metals, with apparent barriers to transport identified at the root: non-photosynthetic stem interface for Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd, and at the non-photosynthetic stem: photosynthetic stem transition for Pb and Cd. All metals accumulated in roots with increasing sediment exposure, and lower soil organic matter predicted greater Pb and Cu uptake to roots. Further, increases in sediment pH predicted greater Cd root accumulation. However, transport was regulated to the non-photosynthetic stem for Zn, and to the PS stem for Zn and Pb. In terms of employing S. quinqueflora as a bioindicator, all root metals, and Pb and Cd in non-photosynthetic stem tissue exhibited relationships with sediment metal loads, though high variability made their predictive ability limited.","10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.04.001","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331332","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064341193&doi=10.1016%2fj.aquabot.2019.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=49afa63d88d9852a5c0d91d06ee7d4b4"

In the present study, growth of S. anglica in the edge and centre zones of pioneer patches colonizing a tidal flat in a marine bay in the south-west Netherlands was investigated. Average biomass and shoot length was significantly lower in centre zones than in edge zones of the patches. Multiple linear regression showed that 84% of the variance in aboveground biomass in the centre zones could be explained by sediment phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. No such relationship existed in the edge zone. This suggests that biomass production in the centre zones of the patches is nutrient limited, but that factors other than sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content determine growth of Spartina in the edge zones.The sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the centre zones of the patches were significantly related with sediment carbon concentrations, indicating that the pool of particle-bound nutrients in the sediment to an important extent is associated with organic particles. Determination of stable carbon isotope signatures of the sedimentary organic matter showed that an increasing carbon content of the sediment in the centre zone of the patches land a rise in plant biomass) coincides with a higher contribution of non-Spartina derived carbon to the sedimentary organic matter pool. Sustained biomass production in the centre zones of the patches, thus, probably depends on deposition of allochthonous organic particles and the nutrient inputs inherent in this process. Due to the construction of large-scale hydro-engineering works, however, conditions for deposition of waterborne particles are currently unfavourable. The consequences of reduced carbon and nutrient inputs into the patches will be particularly in the (older) centre zones, where the nutrient pools in non-refractory organic matter have been drained in the years of previous growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the canopy-enhanced sedimentation for which Spartina is well-known, via positive feed-back effects on plant growth can be crucial for plant vitality, and, hence, for successful colonization of unvegetated areas.

Methods We collected soil and plant samples. We analyzed the soil properties for SOC content, recalcitrant organic carbon (RC), labile organic carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total salinity and water content, as well as stable isotopic carbon composition (delta C-13) in the SOC and RC. SOC and RC were determined using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer. We used delta C-13 values and C/N ratios of the SOC to identify carbon source inputs. The delta C-13 of the SOC and RC was measured using a Sercon Integra CN isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Results The results showed that the S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC pool properties differed significantly between study areas, dependent upon local circumstances and carbon exchanges. The delta C-13 values of SOC in surface sediments from Tianjin to Guangxi were from -25.16 to -20.64 parts per thousand, RC from -27.82 to -23.1 parts per thousand, and C/N ratios between 11.36 and 19.00. These samples had SOC values of 14.77-23.95 g kg(-1), RC values of 11.98-21.44 g kg(-1), and LC values of 0.44-4.08 g kg(-1). The SOC and RC of surface sediments were positively correlated with TN and TP. Conclusions S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC is derived from multiple carbon inputs including from marine and land sources and its formation is driven by complicated factors. TN and TP inputs increase SOC in coastal wetlands. Generally, terrigenous carbon inputs dominate the SOC composition in Chinese coastal wetlands, although marine-derived organic carbon (OC) inputs to sediment increase from northern to southern areas.","10.1007/s11368-021-02969-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331394","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105864251&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-021-02969-0&partnerID=40&md5=b831553598afea4b7b59de5e049dca3a"

This study investigates both the quality of organic matter (OM) by elemental analysis as well as the sediment grain size and clay mineralogy to understand their relative influence on distribution and abundance of benthic foraminifera. This study is carried out on 15 samples regularly spaced from the mudflat to the tidal marsh. The results indicate that grain size is the most limiting parameter. Living (stained) benthic foraminiferal density and species richness are both very low within coarser sediments. OM is the second limiting factor. The density of foraminifera. is the lowest and the species richness is the highest with the lowest organic carbon (C-org) contents and C/N < 12. Conversely, when the C-org is very high and C/N > 12, the density is high and the species richness medium. A high smectite proportion within the clay-size fraction seems to favor the development of Miliammina fitsca. Trochammina inflata and Jadammina macrescens are both favored by an increase of organic carbon proportion but Trochammina inflata preferentially feeds on algal-derived OM when compared with Jadammina macrescens.

The concentrations of total, AB-DTPA-extractable, and the geochemical fractions [acid soluble (F1), reducible (F2), oxidisable (F3), and residual (F4) fraction] of V in the soils were determined. The total V concentrations ranged from 20.7 to 133.1 mg kg(-1) and correlated positively with clay content and the total concentrations of iron (Fe-t), aluminum (Al-t), and manganese (Mn-t). The total V was stronger affected by free Fe and Mn oxides (Fe-d and Mn-d) in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils. The residual fraction of V was dominant in the soils followed by the reducible and the oxidisable fraction and showed a similar behavior to total V. The reducible V was higher in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils and was positively correlated with Fe-t, Al-t, Mn-t, Fe-d, and Mn-d. The impact of Fe-t, Al-t, and Mn-t on the reducible V was stronger in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils, while the impact of Fe-d and Mn-d on the reducible V was stronger in the German soils than Egyptian soils. The oxidisable V was affected by soil organic matter and total sulphur (S-t) in the German soils and by carbonates and S-t in the Egyptian soils. The acid soluble fraction of V was lower than the detection limits in all soils. The AB-DTPA-extractable V concentrations (potential available V) ranged between 0.04 and 4.04 mg kg(-1). The potential mobile fraction (PMF = Sigma F1-F3) accounted 4.4-64.7% of the total V. The alkaline soils showed the highest potential mobility and availability of V compared to the acidic soils, and thus the AB-DTPA-extractable V correlated positively with soil pH as well as clay content, cation exchange capacity, and Fe-t. The reducible fraction contributed stronger to the potential mobility and availability of V than the oxidisable fraction. The canonical discrimination analysis explained 64% of the variability of the geochemical behavior of the different soil groups and showed that the different groups of soils could differentiate from each other. The German soil groups (Eutric Fluvisols, Calcic Luvisols, Tidalic Fluvisol and Haplic Gleysol (Marsh soils)), showed a different geochemical behavior; while the Egyptian Eutric Fluvisols and Sodic Fluvisols were relatively similar in their geochemical behavior and the Haplic Calcisols was relatively close to them. Our results demonstrate that the potential mobilization of V was high in the soils (except for Luvisols) - especially under alkaline conditions-which indicate a release of this toxic metal from the soils to soil solution. This release may cause potential environmental risks such as the transfer of V into the groundwater, the vegetation and food chain. Future studies should elucidate the temporal kinetics of V and the determining factors under different flooding conditions and remediation approaches are necessary to ameliorate V-contaminated soils.

The objective of this study was to characterize the microphytobenthic communities in these biofilms and mats from sediment cores taken in March, June, September and December 2010. Microorganisms were identified and enumerated by microscopy, and their biomass (chlorophyll a, biovolume) quantified at two different stations in the lower supratidal zone, located approximate to 210m apart from each other (namely S1 and S2). Additionally, the colloidal carbohydrates produced by these microbial communities were quantified, together with physical parameters such as temperature, granulometry, moisture and organic matter content of the sediment layers that comprise a typical epibenthic mat. On the other hand, changes in biomass and colloidal carbohydrate content were studied through a half-tidal cycle (7h). There were significant seasonal differences in microphytobenthic biovolume (P < 0.001) with a considerably lower biomass in summer, but no significant differences in microalgal biovolume between stations (P = 0.454). Cyanobacterial biomass (largely composed of the filamentous Microcoleus chthonoplastes) was dominant on all dates at both stations, followed by pennate diatoms. Chlorophyll a and colloidal carbohydrate contents in sediment presented a similar pattern to that of microalgal biovolume; with a 5-fold variation in chlorophyll a for S1 between consecutive sampling events on September and December. There were significant differences between sampling dates in colloidal carbohydrates (P < 0.001) with the lowest values recorded during fall and winter; conversely there were no significant differences between stations (P = 0.324). Silt was the dominant sediment fraction at S1 while sand dominated throughout the uppermost 20mm at S2. Chlorophyll a contents did not show significant differences throughout a half-tidal cycle, likely the product of vertical migration along the section sampled. Conversely, the content of colloidal carbohydrates varied 5-fold, showing a significant (P < 0.001) and steady increase with time of exposure to air and pointing to the rapid metabolic rates of the community. In conclusion, the microphytobenthic community of the Bahia Blanca estuary presented marked seasonality in its biological parameters and overall physiognomy, also showing elevated metabolic rates when subject to tidal fluctuations.","10.1080/01490451.2012.757998","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331407",NA

Here, we evaluated the role of %OM and temperature interactions controlling denitrification rates in eroding (Barataria Bay-BLC) and emerging (Wax Lake Delta-WLD) deltaic regions in coastal Louisiana using the isotope pairing (IPT) and N-2:Ar techniques. We also assessed differences between total (direct denitrification + coupled nitrification-denitrification) and net (total denitrification minus nitrogen fixation) denitrification rates in benthic and wetland habitats with contrasting %OM and bulk density (BD). Sediment (benthic) and soil (wetland) cores were collected during summer, spring, and winter (2015-2016) and incubated at close to in-situ temperatures (30 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 10 degrees C, respectively).

Environments included sodium manufactures, wastes utilization areas, dumping grounds, and agriculture cultivation, where disturbed Ca, Mg, and Fe exist and the impact of Cd and Pb is high. We found Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, and Cd accumulation in the leaves of plants and in invertebrates. Our aim was to determine the selectivity exhibited by soil for nutrients and heavy metals and to estimate whether it is important in elucidating how these metals are available for plant/animal uptake in addition to their mobility and stability within soils. We examined four ecological plant groups: trees, shrubs, minor green plants, and water macrophytes. Among invertebrates, we sampled breastplates Malacostraca, small arachnids Arachnida, diplopods Diplopoda, small insects Insecta, and snails Gastropoda. A higher level of chemical elements was found in saline polluted areas (sodium manufactures and anthropogenic sites). Soil acidity and salinity determined the bioaccumulation of free radicals in the trophic levels measured. A pH decrease caused Zn and Cd to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Ca, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb in the anthropogenic sites. pH increase also caused Na, Mg, and Fe to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Na, Fe, Mn, and Co in the anthropogenic sites. There was a significant correlation between these chemical elements and Ec in soils. We found significant relationships between pH and Ec, which were positive in saline areas of sodium manufactures and negative in the anthropogenic and control sites. These dependencies testify that the measurement of the selectivity of cations and their fluctuation in soils provide essential information on the affinity and binding strength in these environments. The chemical elements accumulated in soils and plants; however, further flow is selective and variable. The selectivity exhibited by soil systems for nutrients and heavy metals is important in elucidating how these metals become available for plant/animal uptake and also their mobility and stability in soils.","10.1007/s10653-015-9761-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331413","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941339060&doi=10.1007%2fs10653-015-9761-5&partnerID=40&md5=74d2333f726403dd16d22de774d77762"
"JOUR",14331414,"Golterman, HL","1995","The labyrinth of nutrient cycles and buffers in wetlands: Results based on research in the Camargue (southern France)","Wetlands, especially in the Mediterranean area, are subject to severe eutrophication. This may upset the equilibrium between phytoplankton production in undesirable quantities and a quantitatively desirable macrophyte production. In order to manage this equilibrium, a quantitative knowledge of nutrient input and fluxes is essential and the role of sediments in these processes must be understood. This knowledge can be useful even for agriculture, e.g. rice cultivation, where optimal utilization of fertilizers can lead to an economic benefit.In this article different aspects of nutrient cycles are discussed in view of approaching a sufficiently precise quantification. The nutrient input balance of the Camargue was therefore measured which showed that the input of nutrients with the irrigation water, taken from the river Rhone, roughly equals the quantity of fertilizers added.Phytoplankton growth can be approached reasonably with the Monod model, although there are still many practical problems, such as the influence of the pH on P uptake and the problem of measuring P uptake in the field. The situation is worse for macrophyte growth; quantitative data are scarce and studies have often been carried out with unrealistic nutrient concentrations or without addressing the influence of the sediment. This influence can also include negative factors, such as high concentrations of Fe2+, H2S or FeS, but cannot yet be quantified.The nitrogen cycle in wetlands is dominated by denitrification. Most wetlands have sediments with high concentrations of organic matter, therefore with a large reducing capacity. Besides this process, we have shown that denitrification can also be controlled by FeS. In the Camargue sediments this denitrification is mediated by bacteria from the sulfur cycle; this appeared to be the major pathway. It was shown that a stoicheiometric relation exists between nitrate reduced and sulphate produced. The influence of the temperature was quantified and appeared to be stronger at high organic matter concentrations than at lower ones. Denitrification with FeS means that the bacteria use nitrate also for their N demands, while this is not necessarily the case during denitrification with organic matter.Mineralization of macrophytes is a much slower process than that of phytoplankton, probably because of their high C/N ratio. We could, however, not confirm the general assumption that the addition of nitrogen stimulates this mineralization. On the contrary, we found that two amino acids both with a C/N ratio of 6 had different mineralization rates. The amino acid composition of dead macrophytes and the C/N ratio may be of equal importance.Unlike nitrogen, phosphate is always strongly adsorbed onto sediments. The two mechanisms of the adsorption of inorganic phosphate onto sediments, i.e. the adsorption onto Fe(OOH) and the precipitation of apatite, have been quantified. The adsorption of phosphate onto Fe(OOH) can be satisfactorily described with the Freundlich adsorption isotherm: P-ads = A*(o-P)(B). The adsorption coefficient A depends on the pH of the system and the Ca2+ concentration of the overlying water and can be quantified preliminarily by A = a.10((-0.416*pH)).(2.86 - (1.86.e(-Ca2+))). B can be approached by 0.333, which means the cube root of the phosphate concentration. The second mechanism is the solubility of apatite. We found a solubility product of 10(-50) for hard waters. The two mechanisms are combined in solubility diagrams which describe equilibrium situations for specific lakes.The conversion of Fe(OOH) to FeS has a strong influence on phosphate adsorption, although the partial reduction of Fe(OOH) approximate to P by H2S does not release significant quantities of phosphate. Even after complete conversion to FeS only a small part of the bound phosphate was released.Besides the two inorganic phosphate compounds, we established the existence of two organic pools, one soluble after extraction with strong acid (ASOP), the other one with strong alkali. The first pool is probably humic bound phosphate, while the larger part of the second pool was phytate. The ASOP was remineralized during the desiccation of a Camargue marsh; this drying up oxidized FeS, thus improving the phosphate adsorption and decreasing the denitrification capacity. It can, therefore, be an important tool for management. The phytate was strongly adsorbed onto Fe(OOH), which explains the non-bioavailability towards bacteria.The fact that the sediment phosphate concentration can be approached by multiplying the relevant sediment adsorption constant with 3 root o-P concentration has the consequence that much larger quantities of phosphate accumulate in the sediments than in the overlying water. This means that even if the phosphate input is stopped, the eutrophication will only be reversed very slowly, and not at all, if the shallow waters in wetlands have no through flow - as is often the case in many marshes in Mediterranean wetlands.","10.1007/BF00028629","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331414",NA

While a wide range of publications have examined the environmental persistence and sediment/soil interactions of ECs following their discharge into aquatic environments, the extent to which ECs are sequestered in estuarine sediments, and the impact of this on their environmental persistence and supply to the ocean, in comparison remains unclear. This Article examines the environmental concentrations of seven, relatively water-soluble and environmentally mobile, ECs (including pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and plasticisers) in dated intertidal saltmarsh cores from two contrasting estuarine sites in the southern U.K. (one heavily urbanised/industrial, the other non-urbanised). Mean sediment EC concentrations are similar in both estuarine systems (in the range 0.1 (acetaminophen) to 17 (4-hydroxyacetophenone) ng/g dry weight). Despite their variable reported Log K-ow values (from ca. 0.5 to > 7), the ECs are all apparently mobile in the marsh systems studied, and where subsurface concentration maxima are present these most likely relate to local flushing or diffusive processes and cannot be clearly linked to likely input trends or changes in sediment geochemistry (including sedimentary organic carbon content). The ""estuarine filter"" here, at least with respect to intertidal saltmarsh sediments, shows reduced potential to sequester the seven ECs examined and mediate their supply to coastal and shelf environments.

Burrows were shorter (x = 19.7 cm, SD = 5.8, n = 54) and more dynamic (entrance displacement: x = 3.2 cm d(-1), SD = 1.7, n = 21) in mud flats than in Spartina-dominated areas (length: x = 41 cm, SD = 12, n = 78; no entrance displacement). Sediment turnover rate was much higher in mud flats (x = 5.9 kg m(-2) d(-1)) than in Spartina-dominated areas (x = 2.4 kg m(-2) d(-1)). Burrow shape differed between areas, being straight, near-vertical tunnels in the vegetated area, but oblique (average angle to vertical = 60 degrees, SD = 16 degrees, n = 110), and having a funnel-shape entrance and a much larger diameter in mud flats. Stomach contents also differed between habitats. Pieces of plants dominated contents in the vegetated area, while sediment (with polychaetes, diatoms, ostracods, and nematodes) dominated in the mud flats, indicating that crabs are mainly deposit feeders in the mud flats and herbivorous in the Spartina-dominated areas. This pattern suggests that the heuristic model relating burrow architecture to trophic modes previously proposed for fossorial thalassinidean shrimps applies to individuals of a C. granulata population. The burrow content showed higher organic content and vegetal parts in the vegetated area than in the other area. Burrows in the mud flat showed a significantly higher abundance of nematodes and ostracods. Due to their hydrodynamic characteristics and content, burrows in the mud flats may work as passive traps for sediment and organic matter. Given the extensive intertidal area inhabited by C. granulata in SW Atlantic estuaries, and the location of their burrows (between marshes and the open estuary), these burrows may work as traps for detritus, thus reducing the export rate of organic matter from marshes.","10.3354/meps155137","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331428","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030922827&doi=10.3354%2fmeps155137&partnerID=40&md5=1231a38597af06aa333284b6e2b9fb92"

We assessed how leaf wax lipids, insoluble macromolecular organic matter, bulk C/N data and compound-specific stable carbon isotopes were linked to the site's palynological record and to evidence for regional sea level and environmental change. Down-core trends in bulk delta C-13 are closely coupled to trends in pollen types from saline-tolerant taxa. These trends are mirrored by variations in the incorporation of reduced sulphur into macromolecular organic matter. This process, quantified with the thiophene ratio, is closely associated with periods of higher sea level 8,000-4,300 cal yr BP. We propose the thiophene ratio is a proxy for relative marine influence within (peri) estuarine sediments. All measured variables indicate differences between early-middle Holocene (8,000-4,300 cal BP) and late Holocene conditions at Verlorenvlei. The former period was more saline and preserves more labile macromolecular organic matter. Marine influence declined after 4,300 cal yr BP, and although the abundance of short-chain-length n-alkanes suggests continued presence of wetland flora until 2,500 cal yr BP, organic matter preservation became poorer and a drying trend was inferred, most notably for the interval 2,500-900 cal BP. Increasing freshwater inundation is apparent during the last 700 cal yr, consistent with several records from this region. Leaf wax n-alkane distributions are largely uncorrelated with bulk organic matter variables, with the exception of the abundance of C-31 and C-33 n-alkanes, which are negatively correlated with delta C-13(TOC). Furthermore, C-31-C-33 n-alkane delta C-13 values are uncorrelated with C-23-C-29 delta C-13 and delta C-13(TOC). They are also higher than our newly measured terrestrial (C-3) vegetation C-29 and C-31 end-member values of -35 +/- A 2 and -34 +/- A 1 aEuro degrees, respectively. These patterns are best explained by a dominant contribution of local riparian vegetation to the C-23-C-29 n-alkanes, but time-varying contributions of non-local leaf waxes to the C-31-C-33 signals. This renders inferences concerning regional environmental change from long-chain leaf waxes potentially challenging in this setting.","10.1007/s10933-015-9833-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331435",NA

A monitoring program before and after restoration has been carried out in the study area located in the Yellow River Delta since 2001. Water quality, soil salinity. soil organic matter, plant community. and bird species were chosen as indicators in this program. During the past seven years, the restored wetland showed increasing efficiency in reducing water pollution levels. Soil quality was constantly improved through salinity reduction and soil organic matter accumulation. The vegetation community quickly re-established after the restoration was initiated in 2002. The restored vegetation communities provide favorable habitat conditions for birds and thirty-seven bird species were observed in October 2007. Based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plant species and vegetation community are mainly influenced by soil salinity and water depth. These indicate that conducting freshwater to the project area is an efficient measure for vegetation restoration. While monitoring results show that the restoration project had positive effects on the wetland ecosystem over the past seven years, two issues remain for future study: (1) the contribution of harvesting vegetation to stabilizing nutrient removal rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter in the soil; and (2) the effects of excessive propagation of Phragmites australis on spatial heterogeneity and plant diversity.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) intends to enhance and sustain its training and testing assets and also optimize its stewardship of natural resources through the development and application of an ecosystem-based management approach on DoD installations. To accomplish this goal, particularly for installations in estuarine/coastal environments, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) launched the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) as a 10-year effort at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) in North Carolina. The results of the second 5 years of the program (DCERP2) are presented in the DCERP2 Final Report.There were four overarching objectives of DCERP2. The first objective was to understand the effects of climate change impacts, including warming temperatures, variability in the hydrological cycle, storm events, and sea level rise on the coastal ecosystems at MCBCL from observations and measurements made over the 10-year program. The second objective was to understand the carbon cycle of the coastal and terrestrial ecosystems at MCBCL through a highly integrated sampling program. The third objective was to develop models, tools, and indicators to evaluate current and projected future ecosystem state changes and translate scientific findings into actionable information for installation managers. The last objective was to recommend adaptive management strategies to sustain ecosystem natural resources within the context of an active military installation.This dataset represents the results of seasonal samplings of triplicate paired fertilized and control plots across three marsh sites at Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, NC.

Very high levels (10-28%) of organic carbon within the heavily oiled sediments are clearly distinguished from those in pristine sediments (<3%). Dissolved organic carbon in contaminated pore waters, ranging up to hundreds of mg/kg, are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those at pristine sites. Heavily oiled sediments are characterized by very high sulfide concentrations (up to 80 mg/kg) and abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria. Geochemical biomarkers and stable carbon isotope analyses fingerprint the presence of oils in sediments. Ratios of selected parameters calculated from the gas chromatograph spectra are in a remarkable narrow range among spilled oils and initial BP crude. At oiled sites dominated by C-4 plants, delta C-13 values of sediments (-20.8 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand) have been shifted significantly lower compared to marsh plants (-14.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) due to the inflow of isotopically lighter oil (-27 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand).

In saltmarsh sediments, dissolved Pu represents approximately 1 part in 10(6) of the total inventory. The Pu concentration in solution is in the range 1.1-3.5 mBq l(-1), varying by a factor of 3 in the course of the year. Most of the changes in dissolved Pu coincide with changes in dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations, with Pu being low in the summer months when Fe and Mn are high. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors which make it unclear as to whether these patterns might be related to seasonal redox changes in the saltmarsh. At the highly organic, reducing reedbed site, the proportion of Pu in solution is typically around 1 part in 10(3), proportionately much higher than in the saltmarsh, giving concentrations ranging between 9.0 and 28.5 mBq l(-1), and are apparently maintained by complexation to dissolved organic matter.

The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.","10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00251.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331461","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031806163&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2745.1998.00251.x&partnerID=40&md5=dcc358977cbe58d9c880e6c0b1d5ef3c"

Invasion of S. alterniflora altered the environmental properties. With the increase of invasion age, the coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content tended to increase, whereas chlorophyll a and salinity tended to decrease. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the habitats were separated along the gradient of the invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and salinity were the most important characters for habitat differentiation because the PCA biplot illustrated that the vectors of these environmental properties involved the smaller angles with PC 1. Based on a two-way ANOVA analysis, invasion stage of S. alterniflora and season significantly affected the density of A. latericea (p < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (p = 0. 226). The density of A. latericea varied significantly among seasons in each habitat based on a one-way ANOVA analysis, except in the bare mudflat without invasion. The highest densities occurred at the mature invasion stage in autumn, whereas the lowest densities occurred with no invasion in spring. Both Taylor's and Iwao's regressions indicated that A. latericea presented an aggregated distribution pattern (p < 0.001). The consistent distribution pattern indicated that it might be a biological trait of the species. Based on stepwise regression analysis, stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content were selected for the optimal regression model. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion altered the environment of the coast and variation in A. latericea density was a response of the species to the environmental change caused by S. alterniflora invasion.

Results showed that the decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79% faster than that of S. alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the C/N and lignin.

The effects of the Holocene sea-level rise on palaeoenvironmental conditions of this coastal sequence were studied by inorganic geochemical methods in conjunction with diatom analyses. Three hundred samples from two parallel sediment cores which cover the entire NW German Holocene were taken at high resolution and were examined for major and minor elements and bulk parameters. Selected samples were analysed for redox-sensitive trace elements and REE distribution, reactive iron and bulk sediment (SiS)-Si-34-S-32-ratios. Chemical parameters, for example Si/Al and Ca/Sr-ratios and total organic carbon (TOC) contents correlate with depositional factors such as wave-energy and lithofacies changes, which allow a detailed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironment. Diatom analyses reveal information about changes between marine, brackish and limnic conditions and serve to reconstruct palaeosalinity. Early diagenetic effects are evident in the TOC-rich intervals. Most peat layers are affected by sulphate reduction and resulting pyrite formation as well as by enrichments in redox-sensitive trace elements. The highest enrichments are seen for As, Mo, Re and U, indicating a distinct seawater influence. S-isotope ratios of peat samples are compatible with pyrite formation under both open- and closed-system conditions, depending on exposition to Seawater. The inorganic geochemical and diatom data suggest limnic conditions at the base of the sequence and repeated changes towards marine conditions within the overlying elastic units. On the other hand, data obtained from the elastic units yield evidence of a recurrent succession from open to restricted marine, brackish-lagoonal, and finally fen environments. Clastic sediments overlying peat layers, correlate with the increase of marine-derived geochemical signatures and pelagic diatoms attest transgressive overlaps. The analyses suggest that major controls on the palaeoenvironments were (i) climate-related oscillations of the coast line and (ii) the morphology of the coastal region allowing marine incursions even into distal semi-terrestrial lowlands.

Shoot density of P. coarctata was influenced by season and was found to be higher (> 2 500 shoots/m(2)) in post-monsoon and minimal in monsoon season; plants were particularly active in vegetative propagation during pre-monsoon. Above-ground biomass was greater along the protected coast compared with the exposed one in this estuary. Below-ground biomass was higher (7.75-269.53 g DW/m(2)) than that above ground (2.20-114.75 g DW/m(2)). Standing crops of P. coarctata showed a negative relationship (R =-0.77; P < 0.05) with sedimentation rate, while seasonal activity influenced sedimentation. The recorded sedimentation rate was lower (6.09 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in pre-monsoon and highest (14.55 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in monsoon season. The mean value of pore water salinity was higher (34.25 +/- 5.05) during post-monsoon and lowest (18.0 +/- 3.71) in monsoon season.

Core sediments from threors' Contributionse transects along Ria Formosa lagoon intertidal zone were analysed using analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) to determine composition, distribution and origin of sedimentary OM. The distribution of alkyl compounds (alkanes, alkanoic acids and alkan-2-ones), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), lignin-derived methoxyphenols, linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), steranes and hopanes indicated OM inputs to the intertidal environment from natural-autochthonous and allochthonous-as well as anthropogenic. Several n-alkane geochemical indices used to assess the distribution of main OM sources (terrestrial and marine) in the sediments indicate that algal and aquatic macrophyte derived OM inputs dominated over terrigenous plant sources. The lignin-derived methoxyphenol assemblage, dominated by vinylguaiacol and vinylsyringol derivatives in all sediments, points to large OM contribution from higher plants.

Low carbon preference indexes (CPI > 1) for n-alkanes, the presence of UCM (unresolved complex mixture) and the distribution of hopanes (C-29-C-36) and steranes (C-27-C-29) suggested localized petroleum-derived hydrocarbon inputs to the core sediments.

We irrigated 1- x 2-m plots at high-marsh, low-marsh, and channel bank sites and flood-irrigated 1- x 3-m plots in the high marsh and low marsh. We measured particulate density, OM content, organic carbon (OC) content, and nitrogen (N) content and calculated OM particulate density and atomic C: N ratios. The content of OM, OC, and N in rainfall-mobilized sediment was consistently higher than in the substrate. C: N ratios ranged from 13 to 15 and were consistently lower than the sediment substrate (16-21). These observations indicate that rainfall can mobilize N preferentially over OC; hence, rainfall events deplete the marsh substrate of OM, OC, and nutrients. Despite variability in the density of mobilized particulates, the calculated OM densities and the C: N ratios remained unchanged during the irrigation experiments. These results indicate that rainfall runoff processes preferentially and consistently mobilize OM-rich particulates with low C: N ratios, characteristic of mixed algal or vascular plant sources. The short-term OC fluxes during these rainfall experiments represent 3-20% of annual primary productivity.","10.4319/lo.2003.48.3.1245","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331484","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038529779&doi=10.4319%2flo.2003.48.3.1245&partnerID=40&md5=30cc7a3d631859cf91ed0fc4e88366c8"

The sequential extraction procedure proposed by Tessier was used to estimate the percentages of the metals present in each geochemical phase of the sediment. Metal concentrations in the solid phase were found to be enriched in the upper layers and mainly associated with reactive fractions such as organic matter, Fe - Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates (46 - 74% of Ni, Mn and Cd, and 11 - 19% of Cu and Zn). Principal factor analysis (PFA) and Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association of metals and their reactive phases with OC (the diagenetic component), and a negative or non-association with the mud content, Al, Fe and Li (the lithogenic component). Diagenetically released metals are mainly mobilized within hypersaline sediments by buoyancy transport (> 90% of total flux) in response to an extreme salinity gradient by input of fresh groundwater (3 - 6 psu cm(-1)). The. molecular diffusion due to the gradient of metals in porewater (maximum and higher levels at 5 - 7 and below 20 cm depth, respectively) is significantly less important to the advective transport. Most of the metals mobilized by diffusion - advection processes are re-precipitated in the sediments by authigenic minerals, only < 10% of most metals are extruded out to the overlying water column. Authigenic accumulation rates were estimated as 1.42 - 7.09 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Cd; 58.8 - 378 for Cu; 6922 - 17,985 for Fe; 38.2 - 345 for Mn; 20.8 - 263 for Ni; and 282 - 2956 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Zn. The Mn - Fe oxyhydroxides (40 - 85% of reactive metals) in the upper oxic - suboxic layers (< 5 cm below surface) and sulfide minerals (75 - 97%) in anoxic sediment layers (7 - 18 cm) constitute the main scavengers for metals.

In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.","10.5194/bg-13-6565-2016","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331501","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006367236&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6565-2016&partnerID=40&md5=d57a008abcef0f9470eec299deab60ff"

Diatom samples were collected from 100 sites in Barnegat Bay and Great Bay representing both subtidal and intertidal habitats. A total of 603 diatom taxa were found, with most samples characterized by high species diversity. A strong north-to-south salinity gradient in the study area was a major factor influencing composition of diatom assemblages. Subtidal sediments, especially in highly productive areas in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay, contained a high proportion of planktonic diatoms, especially small-celled Cyclotella and Chaetoceros species. Habitat type and physical properties, such as particle size and depth, were other important factors structuring diatom assemblages. Water-column nutrients and sediment contaminants did not show much effect on sediment diatoms, possibly due to the overriding effect of salinity or low variability in nutrient/ contaminant concentrations. However, the organic matter content of sediments was significantly related to diatom species composition. Both sediment carbon and nitrogen were considerably higher in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay and other areas experiencing strong human impacts. This study developed diatom inference models for salinity and sediment nitrogen content and concluded that diatom species with relatively high optima for sediment nitrogen may be used as indicators of nutrient enrichment in studied lagoons.","10.2112/SI78-011.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331503",NA

In this study, three short sediment cores, retrieved from the remote Antinioti lagoon (N. Kerkyra Island, NW Greece), are investigated concerning the solid phase composition, distribution, and partitioning of major (Al, Fe) and trace elements (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn). According to Pb-210, the sediments sampled correspond to depositions of the last 120 years. The high amounts of organic carbon (4.1-27.5%) result in the formation of Fe sulphides, predominantly pyrite, already at the surface sediment layers. Pyrite morphologies include monocrystals, polyframboids, and complex FeS-FeS2 aggregates. According to synchrotron-generated micro X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, authigenically formed, Mn-containing, Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (goethite type) co-exist with pyrite in the sediments studied. Microscopic techniques evidence the formation of galena, sphalerite and CuS, whereas sequential extractions show that carbonates are important hosts for Mn, Cd, and Zn. However, significant percentages of non-lattice held elements are bound to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides that resist reductive dissolution (on average 60% of Pb, 46% of Cd, 43% of Zn and 9% of Cu). The partitioning pattern changes drastically in the deeper part of the core that is influenced by freshwater inputs. In these sediments, the post-depositional pyritization mechanism, illustrated by overgrowths of Fe monosulphides on preexisting pyrite grains, results in relatively high degree of pyritization that reaches 49% for Cd, 66% for Cu, 32% for Zn and 7% for Pb.

Inputs of organic carbon and rates of primary production are important influences on MeHg loading and bioaccumulation, and are predicted to increase with changes in climate and land use pressures. To further understand these influences on MeHg levels in estuarine biota, we used a field study approach in sites across different temperature regions, and with varying organic carbon levels. In paired comparisons of sites with high vs. low organic carbon, fish had lower MeHg bioaccumulation factors (normalized to water concentrations) in high carbon sites, particularly subsites with large coastal wetlands and large variability in dissolved organic carbon levels in the water column. Across sites, MeHg level in the water column was strongly tied to dissolved organic carbon, and was the major driver of MeHg concentrations in fish and invertebrates. Higher primary productivity (chlorophyll-a) was associated with increased MeHg partitioning to suspended particulates, but not to the biota. These findings suggest that increased inputs of MeHg and loss of wetlands associated with climate change and anthropogenic land use pressure will increase MeHg concentrations in estuarine food webs.

An assessment of these wetlands has yet to occur, and it has not been determined whether CWs and RWs provide the same functions as natural wetlands (NWs).

Only 16 of 85 plant species identified were native and three of the four most abundant species were exotic. Vegetative characteristics differed primarily across salinity classes, then along hydrologic zones, and to a lesser extent among CWs, RWs, and NWs. Soil properties exhibited fewer differences across salinity classes and along hydrologic zones and greater differences among CWs, RWs, and NWs. The dominant presence of invasive species in coastal Hawaiian wetlands suggests that it will be difficult to locate reference sites that can be used as restoration targets. Differences in edaphic characteristics suggested that RWs/CWs do not exhibit the same functions as NWs.

The surface-deposit feeder Macoma contabulata reduced silt-clay, total nitrogen, and total organic carbon content and the delta C-13 value of the sediment, while the surface-deposit feeder Nuttallia olivacea and the suspension feeder Ruditapes philippinarum did not. The surface-deposit feeders reduced phytobenthic biomass (chlorophyll a, ch1 a) and diatom density at the sediment surface and increased the C/N ratios of the sediment. In contrast, R. philippinarum increased ch1 a although it decreased benthic diatoms, suggesting the promotion of microalgal growth other than diatoms. All the bivalve species reduced the densities of the dominant diatom species differently, and M. contabulata decreased the species richness. Multidimensional scaling and 1-way analysis of similarity revealed that the bivalves specifically modified the abundances and composition of the diatoms in relation to their feeding habits, while the relative diatom species abundances hardly changed. These data suggest that the bivalves show little selectivity when they ingest benthic diatoms. A 2-source mixing model using delta C-13 values revealed that benthic diatoms were the more important carbon source (> 69%) for the deposit-feeding bivalves, both in natural habitats and in enclosures. In contrast, R. philippinarum obtained 61% carbon from suspended solids (SS) in the natural habitat, whereas in the enclosures it obtained 62% carbon from benthic diatoms. The dietary change of this species might be related to the supply of SS and resuspended sediment.","10.3354/meps299067","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331516",NA

The contents of eight heavy metals, together with sediment composition and total organic carbon were analyzed to reveal the distribution patterns of the heavy metals. Environmental quality status was evaluated using both the index of geoaccumulation (I-geo) and the index of the Hakanson ecological risk. The analytical results showed that the average contents of Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were below the standard for the Category I sediment quality, among which Cd, Hg, Ni and Zn exceeded the sediment background value of the region. On the whole, the contents of eight heavy metals in vegetation areas were higher than those associated with the adjacent bare flat areas. These data sets indicate a non-polluted condition in term of I-geo estimation; however, a critical state of low to moderate degrees of pollution and a low level of risk were deduced according to the index of the Hakanson potential ecological risk. Both indices suggested that the pollution level of Hg and Cd were the highest among the eight metals measured. Along the transection from seaward to landward, the contents of As, Cu and Hg, their indices of Igeo and Hakanson ecological risk all showed an increasing tread, in accordance with the condition of vegetation cover. Along the coastline with S. alterniflora being distributed in patchiness, all metal contents and their ecological risk level values for the marshes were higher than those for the unvegetated sediments nearby; moreover, except for Hg, other seven metals exhibited relatively low values than those in the shore-normal section with a better S. alterniflora growth. These findings indicate that S. alterniflora is one of important factors to enrich the heavy metal in tidal flat sediment. Thus, ecological risk of the heavy metal is reduced or blocked, due to the filtering effect of salt-marsh, which prevents metals from entering the open sea directly. The distribution of heavy metal is influenced by a combination of colonization time of vegetation, chemical form of metals and their origins.","10.13227/j.hjkx.2014.06.049","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331522","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904098742&doi=10.13227%2fj.hjkx.2014.06.049&partnerID=40&md5=da9888f09a5c672b8117379581fc40f8"

While the total increase in elevation determines if a wetland can keep up with sea level rise, microtopography impacts, inter alia, hydrological patterns, which again drive surface elevation changes. We analyzed the dynamics of surface morphology during the course of one year at five locations along a transect from land (interior zone) to sea (fringe zone) in a coastal Phragmites wetland at the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (Southern Baltic Sea) using a modified Surface-Elevation Table. Landwards this wetland is confined by a dyke while the seaward boundary of the wetland is formed by a micro-cliff. A small strip between the interior and the fringe zone is characterized by small basins (basin zone). Surface elevation changes in the wetland interior are mainly driven by its own productivity. Litter accumulation by the dense Phragmites stands is high, but a combination of high organic sediments and water scarcity led to compaction and counteracted vertical accretion. While the surface elevations of the measurement location in the basin zone and one of the locations in the interior zone remained fairly stable (intra-annual changes<+/- 0.8 mm), the other location in the interior showed a drastic decrease in surface elevation (-3.3 cm year(-1)). This large deviation may have been caused by the high spatial variability of sediment organic matter. The micro-cliff eroded constantly (3.7 cm year(-1)); its steepness and surface roughness increased making it more vulnerable to the forces of the sea. The micro-cliff protects the wetland interior from flooding but at the same time suppresses allogenic sediment input. The simple approach to use freely available water level data to predict morphological changes in the fringe zone did not yield significant model results. However, the strong intra-annual variability in elevation change especially in the fringe zone showed that short-term changes may often mask long-term trends. Although we cannot predict long-term developments from our relatively short-term measurements, our results indicate that wetland evolution in such squeezed environments is threatened. In dyked wetlands sediment supply from the land is suppressed and lateral erosion at the seaward edge leads to marsh retreat. None of the measuring locations is currently keeping up with local sea level rise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that SOC contents of 0-60cm soil layer in transects ranged from 0.46 to 10.15gkg(-1) and average values of soil profiles ranged from 2.15 to 5.00gkg(-1). The SOC contents tended to increase from the river flood land to the salt beach, which could be accounted for the organic matters including large algae, the bodies and excretion of marine animals due to the feedback of tides. The significant difference of SOC contents at different vegetation communities was observed, while the difference of SOC in soil profiles was not obvious. The SOC contents in 0-30cm soil layers decreased with plant growth period, while in 40-60cm soil layers were relatively stable. The mean soil organic carbon density was 3.05kgCm(-2) in study region, which was much lower than that reported in other ecosystems, and its spatiotemporal variations were consistent with that of SOC content. Further analysis revealed that SOC was positively correlated with total nitrogen and clay contents. Our findings indicated that the newborn coastal wetland in the YRD should be a potential sink of SOC.","10.1002/clen.201100511","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331533",NA

Sediment samples were collected during summer and monsoon of 2013. Each was analysed for environmental variables such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, sulphate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, organic carbon, organic matter and redox potential. Abundance and methanogenic potential of two distinct groups of methanogenic archaea (i.e. aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogens) were quantified by incubating the sediment samples in basal media, added with acetate or methanol as substrate. Most of the environmental variables showed significant differences spatially and temporally. Among the environmental variables, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and salinity were higher during summer, while total kjeldahl nitrogen, sulphate and organic carbon were higher during monsoon. Abundance of both aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogens showed significant variations both spatially and temporally. Aceticlastic methanogens were abundant during monsoon, with a maximum value of 810 +/- 13 CFU g(-1), and methylotrophic methanogens were abundant during summer, with a maximum value of 1770 +/- 30 CFU g(-1). Results of methanogenic potential of sediment samples showed a range of 0.01 +/- 0.00 to 12.03 +/- 035 mol m(-3). Among the two substrates, methanol favoured the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens, while acetate induced the methanogenic activity. Methanogenic activity was higher during monsoon than summer that can be attributed to the favourable sedimentary conditions (like reduced redox potential and increased substrate availability). Aceticlastic methanogens were abundant at bottom layers and methylotrophic methanogens in top layers of the sediments. The results of canonical correspondence analysis revealed the existence of linear relationship between methanogenic archaea and environmental variables among the sampling stations. Higher values of salinity, electrical conductivity and total kjeldahl nitrogen favoured the distribution and abundance of aceticlastic methanogens. However, the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens was favoured by highly reduced conditions and high pH values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the seasonal influence of the needle rush, Juncus roemarianus, on saltmarsh sediment geochemistry, pore waters and sediments were collected from the upper 50 cm of two adjacent sites, one unvegetated and the other vegetated by Juncus roemarianus, in a Georgia saltmarsh during winter and summer. Pore waters collected at 1- to 2-cm intervals were analyzed for pH, alkalinity, dissolved phosphate, ammonium, Fe(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), sulfide, sulfate, and organic carbon. Sediments were collected at 5-cm intervals and analyzed for iron distribution in the solid phase using a two-step sequential extraction. The upper 50 cm of the sediment pore waters are mostly sulfidic during both winter and summer. The pore water and sediment geochemistry suggest organic matter degradation is coupled mostly to Fe (III) and sulfate reduction. In summer, there is greater accumulation of alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate in the pore waters and lower levels of ascorbate extractable Fe, which is presumed to be comprised primarily of readily reducible Fe(III) oxides, in the sediments, consistent with higher organic matter degradation rates in summer compared to winter. Lower pH, alkalinity, ammonium, and sulfide concentrations in sediments with Juncus, compared to nearby unvegetated sediments, is consistent with release of oxygen into the Juncus rhizosphere, especially during summer.","10.1007/s12237-007-9000-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331551","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-46249102455&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-007-9000-0&partnerID=40&md5=2c9e418d5899454694a361b283f0953a"

Push cores were taken from the middle marsh at sites classified as unoiled, lightly oiled, and heavily oiled based on concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ([TPAH]). Cores were sliced and stained with rose Bengal to detect live specimens of foraminifera. Short-term, sediment-mixing depths were determined using the penetration depths of excess Th-234, and sedimentary organic carbon and carbonate were measured to distinguish depositional environments. Marsh foraminifera reacted to the highest oil concentration (5,000-18,000 ng/g of TPAH) by reducing standing stock and shortening the DOH compared with the control sites. At a second, less heavily oiled site, foraminifera responded with a shallower DOH, but with a boom in standing stock. Deformed, dead foraminifera occurred in all heavily oiled cores-but not elsewhere. Live foraminifera responded with a population boom at lightly oiled sites with [TPAH] near 1,100 ng/g.

Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground root production is proposed to increase soil elevation enabling these intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level. However, shallow soil subsidence is frequently observed, which may cancel out or even outweigh the positive effects of surface accretion and root production on soil elevation gains. The processes that lead to shallow soil subsidence have not often been investigated. Here, we used computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the volume of coarse pores in the top 20 cm of 30-cm-deep soil cores collected from mangroves and salt marshes within Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. The four field sites have long-term observations of variation in soil surface elevation gain, surface accretion rate, and shallow subsidence rate using the rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method. Over our sites, we found that the rates of shallow soil subsidence were positively related to the volume of soil coarse pores and soil clay and silt content rather than to the volume of fine pores or total porosity or other soil properties. In turn, the volume of soil coarse pores was positively related to the volume of animal burrows and root mass. Fine-pore volume and total porosity of soils were negatively associated with soil bulk density, which was in turn negatively related to soil organic matter content. Our results indicate influences of differently sized soil pores in shallow soil subsidence and suggest that animal burrowing may play a role in shallow soil subsidence.","10.1007/s12237-019-00659-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331562","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074766995&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-019-00659-2&partnerID=40&md5=83113c4e33a6f993e2bcd4a3daead83f"

The results showed that the sedimentary type of Luoyuan Bay was clay silt. The TOC, TN, delta C-13, and delta N-15 were in the range of 0.450-0.955%, 0.054-0.101%, -23.75 to - 19.47%o, and 3.57-6.72%, respectively; the C/N was in the range of 8.80-13.78. The grain-size parameters of the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were similar, whereas a similarity in the carbon and nitrogen parameters between the transition zone and mudflat was observed. The correlation of TOC and TN was different between the fresh organic matter and the obsolete organic matter. The particle size was not the main factor that controlled the TOC and TN contents in the sediments; the delta C-13 indicated the organic matter was dominated by marine sources. The average deposition rates in the Spartina alterniflora marsh, transition zone, and mudflat were 2.47, 2.79, 1.16 g cm(-2) y(-1), respectively. In the Spartina alterniflora marsh, the TOC and TN content increased by 96% and 104%, respectively, from 1955 to the present. Compared with the mudflat, the TOC and TN content in the layer between the surface and the 40-cm depth of the Spartina alterniflora marsh were 26% and 13% higher, respectively. The introduction of Spartina alterniflora and the metabolism of their roots had a significant effect on the carbon and nitrogen deposition in the layer at 0-40 cm depth. The carbon sequestration rate of the salt marsh wetland in Luoyuan Bay was comparable to the carbon sequestration of global marshes. The deposition rates of TOC and TN in the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were greater than twice that in the mudflat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is alarming as this is a species with a known history as an aggressive invasive plant which has now been found 8000 km from its nearest known location and furthermore it is spreading under atypical conditions of submergence. This first recorded population in Africa indicates the adaptive potential of this invasive grass which survives inundation and non-tidal conditions for months at a time. Spartina alterniflora spread from 2566 m(2) in 2006 to a maximum area covered of 10,221 m(2) in 2011. There was an increase in silt, sediment organic matter and a significant reduction in sediment redox potential at sites invaded by S. alterniflora. When the estuary closes to the sea the water level rises and S. alterniflora is flooded, limiting opportunities for mechanical and chemical control. Application of a glyphosate-based herbicide in 2012 showed that chemical control was more effective in reducing the stands than mechanical removal. The additional use of imazapyr in 2014 significantly reduced stem density and the proportion of live stems. Spread of this invasive plant to the intertidal marshes in adjacent estuaries is a potential biodiversity threat although, fortunately, this population does not seem to produce viable seed. There is also the concern that hybridization with the resident S. maritima may occur. Important research and management questions remain i.e. how quickly will the natural marsh re-establish following eradication and how can we prevent movement of the grass to other estuaries?","10.1007/s10530-015-0957-5","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331567","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978511835&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-015-0957-5&partnerID=40&md5=ad5a4161e832d252b2e376ff5d25d2f3"

Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles. Heavy metal levels in sediments of the Min River estuary were much higher compared with most estuaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern. Both Ni and Pb in sediments of the intertidal zone showed high potential toxicity and high contributions to the sum of the toxic units (Sigma TUs).

Our results showed that TP contents in spring and AP contents in both seasons in surface soils increased with increasing distances away from the Yellow River channel. TP contents in surface soils (0-10 cm) followed the order Site A (698.6 mg/kg) > Site B (688.0 mg/kg) > Site C (638.8 mg/kg) > Site D (599.2 mg/kg) in fall, while Site C (699.6 mg/kg) > Site D (651.7 mg/kg) > Site B (593.6 mg/kg) > Site A (577.5 mg/kg) in spring.

Organic geochemistry","Total organic carbon, C/N ratios of sediment organic matter and delta C-13 of sediment organic matter (delta C-13(org)) were measured as a function of depth at four sites in a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA during summer 2006. The goal of this study is to assess the sources of sediment organic matter at each site and to investigate the influence of macrophytes and macrofauna on the observed carbon isotopic signatures and C/N ratios at each site. The four sites include two adjacent creekside sites, one densely vegetated by tall-form Spartina alterniflora and the other mostly unvegetated, together with two adjacent sites higher in the marsh, including a site with sparse short-form Spartina and a neighboring site densely vegetated with Juncus roemarianus. Total organic carbon in the sediments of these sites varies between 2.1 and 6.4%, with the highest values observed at shallow depths at the unvegetated creek bank and the lowest at the short Spartina site. C/N ratios of the sediment organic matter vary between 10.6 and 17.3, with higher values at the short Spartina site compared to the other three sites. delta C-13(org) varies little with depth, averaging -20.1 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand at the Juncus, tall Spartina and adjacent unvegetated sites, and -17.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand at the short Spartina site. Mixing calculations completed with the depth-averaged C/N and delta C-13(org) for each site, assuming three endmember organic matter sources (C-3 plants, C-4 plants, phytoplankton), suggest that up to 75% of the organic matter at all four sites is derived from phytoplankton. Surprisingly, the average delta C-13(org) and C/N values, and therefore the calculated contributions of the three endmember organic matter sources to the total sediment organic matter, are very similar at the Juncus, tall Spartina and unvegetated creekbank sites. The greater delta C-13(org) and C/N of the short Spartina sediments is consistent with little or no inclusion of C-3-derived organic matter in the sediments at this site, in spite of the close proximity to the densely-vegetated Juncus site, and with less degradation of the organic matter compared to the other three sites.

High soil salinity limits most plants and the plant community in coastal salt marsh is mainly composed of salt-tolerant plants. The resilience of ecosystem is largely determined by the standing vegetation. However, little is known about how pioneer vegetation impacts on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, especially associated with salinization. Thus, field investigations were conducted to evaluate the difference of soil indicators in vegetation patches with that in bare lands during an intense soil salinization period in Bohai Sea coastal wasteland, North China. Root distribution for vegetation patches and soil physicochemical properties for vegetation patches and bare lands were examined in 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depth layers. The results showed that regardless of the plant species, roots in vegetation patches were mainly distributed in 0-20 cm depth and greatly promoted the soil spatial heterogeneity. Particularly, soils beneath vegetation patches exhibited higher soil total carbon content, total porosity, macro-porosity, large aggregates percentage, mean weight diameter, and saturated water content; lower bulk density, capillary porosity, soil water storage capacity, and soil electrical conductivity than that for bare lands in 0-20 cm depth. The correlation analysis among topsoil (0-20 cm) indicated that the formation of soil large aggregates and pore structure was negatively related to soil electrical conductivity. In conclusion, vegetation patches promoted the formation of soil large aggregates and macro-porosity in topsoil by root distribution. Moreover, the plant-mediated soil structure improvement enhanced the soil resistance to salt accumulation and further promoted the topsoil desalinization. The findings of this study provide some insights into the regulation of pioneer vegetation on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, supporting ecological succession and plant-mediated ecological restoration in saline lands.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105393","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331597","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105302210&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105393&partnerID=40&md5=1422e07c81f3768c98396a3ea1c3159d"

The habitat change, as a result of active sand deposition and process of hummock formation, also has a great impact on community diversity. The plant cover is negatively correlated with diversity.

"CONF",14331603,"Pant, Hem Raj; Hu, Liming; Zhang, Guoping","2013","Erosional Resistance of Cohesive Sediments in the Coastal Saltmarshes of Northern Gulf Coast","Coastal wetlands are the most productive ecosystem on Earth. The Northern Gulf Coast's saltmarshes, one of the largest wetlands in North America, are undergoing severe land loss at an alarming rate, mainly due to erosion and subsidence, among others. The erosional resistance of cohesive sediments in the saltmarshes determines the wetland stability and sustainability. In this study, a cohesive strength meter was employed in the field and laboratory to measure the critical shear stress in an oil-contaminated saltmarsh and a non-oily normal saltmarsh. In addition, the variation of critical shear stress along the depth was measured for both sites. Results indicate that various soil properties (e.g., water content, organic matter content, root content, pore water salinity, particle size distribution) integratively affect saltmarshes' erodibility. Yet, a clear understanding of the independent influence of these physical and geochemical properties on the erodibility of cohesive sediments requires further work. In general, a positive correlation exists between the critical shear stress and organic matter and root contents. The erosion threshold of the oil-contaminated sediment surface is less than that of the non-oily sediment, which may be attributed to the possibly reduced interparticle binding due to the residual crude oil retained within the pores of the cohesive sediments. However, an increase in the root contents below the ground surface in the oily sediments leads to better stability at depth than the non-oily sediments.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331603",NA

The results imply that prior to major releases of contaminant C-14 from Sellafield, the C-14 specific activity of organic matter in Irish Sea offshore sediments was about 24 Bq kg(-1) C, while that of the carbonate component was below the limit of detection. These results provide baseline data for modelling the uptake of contaminant C-14 by the Irish Sea sediment system. The study confirmed that delta(13)C analyses provide a sensitive means of apportioning the origin of saltmarsh organic matter between C-3 terrigenous plants, C-4 terrigenous plants and suspended particulate marine organic matter. For the < 2 mm fraction of sediment, a clear pattern of decreasing marine organic input was observed in response to increasing elevation of the marsh surface as a result of sediment accumulation. Bulk sediment, including detrital vegetation, had a dominant input from terrigenous plants. The combined use of delta C-13 and C-14 data revealed that organic matter in the marine organic component of the < 2 mm fraction of contemporary surface sediments of the saltmarshes is dominated by recycled old organic material.","10.1039/b315766k","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331615",NA

A multi-method biogeochemical study","Coastal wetlands in Louisiana experience high rates of edge erosion due to combined eustatic sea level rise and coastal subsidence. This study sought to (1) evaluate site-specific spatial and temporal patterns in marsh edge erosion rates within Barataria Bay, LA, (2) develop an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of eroding soils through biogeochemical and spectroscopic characterization, and (3) evaluate interactions between erosion, saltwater incursion, and soil properties through a comparison of sites with different erosion rates and varying distances from the eroding edge. Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively. Neither erosional magnitude nor saltwater incursion was found to be significant predictors of any measured spectroscopic or biogeochemical parameters, though depth was a significant control on 18 of the measured 20 parameters. The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion. This study is the first to couple spectroscopic and biogeochemical measurements for the purpose of assessing soil and porewater physicochemistry within wetland soils and illustrates an as-yet unaccounted for potential for the export of labile C, N, and P into the coastal ocean.","10.1016/j.catena.2019.104373","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331629","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076620267&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104373&partnerID=40&md5=824421bab70bad93b66658398eb04353"

In this study of a degraded and rehabilitated subtropical saltmarsh on the east coast of Australia, measurements of the changes in the soil microalgal community using chlorophyll a showed the differences between reference sites and treatment sites. Analyses of across-site variables showed that solar radiation, rainfall, and tidal inundation influenced microalgal growth, highlighting the importance of seasonal studies. Microalgal abundances showed relationships with developing site variables such as percentage soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen.

Small-sized teleost fish, occurring in fragmented populations under contrasting environments, have been widely used as study models to investigate these issues. In the present study, the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus was used to investigate the relationships between some habitat features and life history strategy. We selected four sites in the Venice lagoon inhabited by this species, exhibiting different combinations of two factors: overall adult mortality, related to intertidal water coverage and a consequent higher level of predator exposure, and the level of sediment organic matter, as indicator of habitat trophic richness. Results showed that these were the two most important factors influencing demography and life history traits in the four sites. Fish from salt marshes with high predator pressure were smaller and produced a higher number of eggs, whereas bigger fish and a lower reproductive investment were found in the two closed, not tidally influenced habitats. Habitat richness was positively related with population density, but negatively related with growth rate. In particular the synergy between high resources and low predation level was found to be important in shaping peculiar life history traits. Results were discussed in the light of the interactions between selective demographic forces acting differentially on age/size classes, such as predation, and habitat trophic richness that may represent an important energetic constraint on life history traits. The importance to link habitat productivity and morphology to demographic factors for a better understanding of the evolution of life history strategy under contrasting environments was finally suggested.

Macrofaunal densities in Pacific S. foliosa marshes (avg. 122,268 indiv. m(-2) > 300 mu m) were 3 to 10 times higher than observed in Atlantic S. alterniflora and S. anglica marshes. The macrofauna of S. foliosa marshes was composed mainly of enchytraeid, naidid, and tubificid oligochaetes (66%), with the enchytraeids dominant at all sites except Bolsa Chica Lagoon. Polychaetes, insects, and peracarid crustaceans accounted for most of the remaining fauna. Multivariate analyses indicated greatest faunal similarity between the two southernmost marshes (Mission Bay and San Diego Bay), and between Anaheim and Newport Bay marshes, with Bolsa Chica Lagoon exhibiting a distinct assemblage. There were strong positive associations of faunal abundance and composition with percent organic matter and percent open area, and negative associations with percent sand and dry weight of algae. For the vegetated marsh in Mission Bay, faunal comparisons were made with an adjacent mudflat and with a S. alterniflora marsh in North Carolina, USA. The unvegetated mudflat exhibited similar macrofaunal densities but higher species richness than the adjacent Spartina marsh. The macrofaunal assemblage of the Mission Bay S. foliosa marsh differed from that of the Atlantic S. alterniflora marsh and the Pacific mudflat in having a greater proportion of oligochaetes, especially Enchytraeidae, and fewer polychaetes. This study represents the first published description that we are aware of for macrofauna in S. foliosa vegetated marsh sediments.

In the current study, we assessed the accumulation and partitioning of the metal(loid)s Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Se in the dominant saltmarsh primary producer, Sporobolus virginicus, across three urbanised estuaries in NSW Australia. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, while Sydney Olympic Park, Port Jackson exhibited intermediate metal(loid) loadings and Hunter Wetlands exhibited the lowest loadings among estuaries. Essential metals (Zn and Cu) were more mobile, with sediment:root bioconcentration factors (BCFs) greater than unity and translocation among plant organs greater than, or equal to, unity. Other metal(loid)s were less mobile, with BCFs equal to unity and translocation factors among organs much reduced. Despite these barriers to translocation, all metal(loid)s were accumulated to roots with dose, and further accumulative relationships between metal(loid)s in roots and culms, and culms and leaves, were evidenced (with the exception of Cu). Along with sediment metal(loid)s, increases in sediment pH predicted Cu uptake in roots and increases in soil organic matter predicted Se uptake in roots. Although significant positive linear relationships were observed between sediment metal (loid)s and plant organ metal(loid)s(withholding Cu), the variance explained was low to intermediate for most metal(loid)s suggesting employing S. virginicus as an accumulative bioindicator would be impractical.

In this work, the variations produced by S. alterniflora in the seasonal dynamics of soil microbial metabolism were examined and compared with the soil microbial metabolism of bare flat. The obtained results indicated that S. alterniflora increases soil total carbon content during the whole year, and decreases soil salinity in spring, summer and winter. The presence of S. alterniflora enhanced the metabolic activity of soil microbes in summer. In autumn, Shannon (H') and Pielou (J) indices were significantly decreased in S. alterniflora-invaded soil. S. alterniflora altered microbial carbohydrate, amino acid, carboxylic acid, and phenolic acid metabolism in a season-dependent manner, and enhanced microbial amine metabolism during the four seasons.

Common sediment assessments in intertidal systems include particle size distribution, as well as water and organic matter contents. These measures require extracting and processing a sediment core, and this disturbance may result in data that do not necessarily reflect in situ conditions. Sediment penetrability measured in situ using a penetrometer can circumvent this limitation. However, relationships between sediment penetrability and other sediment variables are poorly understood, especially in coastal systems. We evaluated the relationship between sediment penetrability and depth to the apparent redox potential discontinuity, mean particle size, organic matter content, and water content on tidal flats along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada. We also assessed whether adding penetrability into environmental models of the infaunal community improved model performance. We observed that while penetrability is statistically related to other sediment variables, relationships to covariates were weak. Further, inclusion of penetrability with other sediment variables improved the performance of models predicting infaunal community composition. Therefore, penetrability can be considered a separate variable, and contributes to an integrated assessment of environmental conditions experienced by biota. Finally, since we evaluated this method in different soft-sediment intertidal ecosystems (mudflats to sandflats), this method is applicable to a range of systems in other geographical areas.","10.3354/meps13428","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331666",NA

Total and diffusive fluxes were determined for four different seasons (August and October 2006 and February and May 2007). Diffusive oxygen fluxes ranged from 7.62 to 11.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S1 and 8.85 to 14.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S2. Total oxygen fluxes varied from 20.2 to 27.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S1 and from 18.7 to 31.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S2. Total oxygen fluxes were 2 similar to 3 times higher than diffusive oxygen fluxes, a result that agrees well with previous studies of the coastal and continental shelf area. The difference between the total and diffusive fluxes is caused by the bio-irrigation activities of macrofauna living in the sediments, which enhance the ventilation of the sediment and introduce oxygenated water to the deeper, anoxic sediment layer. The total oxygen flux at station S1 exhibited small seasonal variation while that at station 2 showed large seasonal variation. Organic carbon contents in the surface sediments correlated well with total oxygen flux, suggesting that the input flux of organic matter is a major factor controlling the seasonal variation in total oxygen flux. Annual benthic aerobic respiration rates were determined to be 8.8 and 9.1 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at stations S1 and S2, respectively; these values are very similar to estimations for Aarhus Bay, Denmark and the southwestern lagoon of New Caledonia.","10.1007/BF02857049","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331682",NA

The tunnels enclosed the near bottom water, whereas the flume canalized the total water column. One tunnel was set up in a mussel bed and another one in an adjacent sand bottom as a control. The flume enclosed a mussel lane and a sand lane. In the tunnel and in the flume the mussel bed revealed ammonium and phosphate discharge. At the same time, phytoplankton, dominated by Phyaeocystis globosa, was taken up intensively. These flux rates showed the same tendency but they were higher in the flume than in the tunnel. Different tendencies and flux rates for oxygen and particulate organic matter (POC, PN) were found in flume and tunnel. These differences demonstrate the importance of water column processes regarding the material exchange of a mussel bed. Tunnels enclose smaller bodies of water and are therefore expected to detect even small effects of the benthos on the passing water. In flumes, benthic influence may be diluted over the entire water column but conditions are more natural. The use of flumes is restricted to shallow waters while tunnels have the potential to be used at any depth.","10.1007/BF02367104","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331689",NA

This study used pulse-chase C-13-labeling to investigate the production, processing, and fate of MPB-derived carbon (MPB-C) in sub-Arctic intertidal sediments over 31 d. Gross primary production (2.1 mmolCm(-2)h(-1)+/- 0.4 mmolCm(-2)h(-1)) was comparable to that reported for temperate regions. Some of the C-13 fixed by sub-Arctic MPB was rapidly (within 0.5 d) transferred to deeper sediments (below 2 cm), but most was retained within surface sediments (>70.2% of the C-13 present at any time during the study). At any time, MPB accounted for49.8% of this C-13. The C-13 content of sediment organic carbon declined over time, but>31% of the C-13 fixed within the first tidal cycle remained after 31 d, suggesting that sub-Arctic MPB may contribute to coastal carbon retention during the productive season. Over 21 d, 10.6% of the fixed C-13 was removed via DIC fluxes and 0.3% via DOC fluxes from inundated sediment, and 0.6% as CO2 from exposed sediment. The greatest loss of C-13 (38.2%) was via unmeasured pathways, including resuspension and/or removal by mobile consumers. The rates of MPB-C production and the relative importance of the pathways for MPB-C loss were similar to that observed for comparable lower latitude sediments, demonstrating that MPB at higher latitudes are not necessarily distinct from MPB at lower latitudes and probably play a similarly important role in ecosystem functioning. Apparently, local environmental conditions are more important than climate differences for determining the processing and fate of MPB-C.","10.1002/lno.10377","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331697",NA

Living and dead foraminiferal species from 10 stations were analyzed over two successive years in the summer (dry) and fall (wet) seasons. There were insignificant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the distribution of live and dead species. But there was a noticeable decrease in calcareous assemblages (Haynesina sp.) between live populations and dead assemblages, indicating that most of the calcareous tests were dissolved after burial; the agglutinated assemblages were comparable between constituents. The live populations and dead assemblages were dominated by Miliammina fusca in the tidal flat and low marsh, Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata and M. fusca in the high marsh, and Trochamminita irregularis and Balticammina pseudomacrescens in the highest marsh to upland. Geochemical analyses (VC, TOC and C/N of bulk sedimentary organic matter) show no significant influence of inter-annual variations but a significant correlation of PC values (R = -0.820, p < 0.001), TOC values (R = 0.849, p < 0.001) and C/N ratios (R = 0.885, p < 0.001) to elevation with respect to the tidal frame.

A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon (SL) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon (NL) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats (MF) and vegetated saltmarshes (SM). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across BI's sediments, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon's (PAH's) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon. This study highlights the ability of a functioning coastal wetland to flourish and sequester elevated levels of carbon, metals and pollutants under the constraints of increasing anthropogenic impact. As the inadvertent result of geo-engineering, BI and its environs is a very important site to investigate the potential of artificially constructed wetlands to act as blue carbon reservoirs.

P significantly increased macrophyte primary production, which led to the rapid elimination of cyanobacterial mats. The replacement of cyanobacterial mats by macrophytes constrained autotrophic nitrogen (N) fixation, increased the quantity, and changed the quality of organic matter input to the sediments. We predicted that the activity of sediment heterotrophic N fixers will be impacted by these alterations in carbon input. We used the acetylene reduction technique to measure potential (glucose amended) nitrogenase activity (NA) in sediments from controls and treatment plots that have been P enriched for four years and dominated either by Eleocharis cellulosa, or Typha domingensis for two years. NA in P-enriched plots was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than NA in controls. NA was positively correlated with the soil reactive P, both total organic and microbial carbon, live root biomass, and total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) as an indicator of active microbial biomass. It was negatively correlated with the concentration of ammonium-N. Path analysis revealed that the indirect effect of P on NA through the root biomass was more important than the direct effect of P. NA of the upper sediment layer was consistently higher in Eleocharis than in Typha dominated plots, despite the higher litter input by Typha. We feel that the higher levels of lignin and phenolics occurring in Typha litter, relative to Eleocharis, constrained NA in Typha plots.","10.1007/s10750-009-9715-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331709",NA

However, during the decay process, the plant detritus carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures may vary from that of the original plant material. This fractionation during plant decomposition may impose limitations on the interpretation of results based on the stable isotopes approach. Studies investigating this process for estuarine primary producers have shown contrasting results, and for some producers, they are still scarce. The present study investigated the temporal variations in the elemental (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratios) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions of C-3 and C-4 salt marsh plants (Scitpus maritimus and Spartina densiflora, respectively), seagrass (Ruppia maritima) and opportunistic macroalgae (Rhizoclonium sp.) during decomposition. For this purpose, an in situ experiment using litterbag incubations was conducted in a shallow water ( < 2 m) estuarine site over twelve weeks to investigate the plant decomposition process under the natural variability of environmental conditions (i.e., freshwater discharge, dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, water salinity and temperature). Our results indicated that detritus biomass and nutrient mineralization rates varied among the different estuarine plant species. Overall decreases in the C:N ratios primarily resulted from total organic carbon losses. However, low variations in delta C-13 ( < 2 parts per thousand) were detected, possibly due to the short-term duration of our study. The observed lack of significant changes in total nitrogen content and the small changes in N-15 values during plant material degradation suggests, to some extent, N-limitation of microbial growth. The observed low levels of isotopic fractionation during decomposition support the usefulness of stable isotopes as natural tracers of organic matter. Nonetheless, to investigate the effects of several environmental and biotic factors on nutrient isotopic fractionation during plant decay and their implications for ecological studies, we emphasize the need for further experimental studies performed under distinct environmental conditions.","10.1016/j.jembe.2017.12.013","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331714",NA

Parameters investigated were composition, structure and dynamics of benthic and edaphic communities (Annelida, Mollusca, Crustacea). Additionally, collembola have been investigated at six supratidal stations from 1990 to 1991. The physical environment is characterized by gradients of inundation, and salinity. The inundation-index varies between 0 in epitidal and 3500 in mid-level intertidal habitats. Salinity ranges from limnetic to marine conditions. Mean salinities in the supratidal zone are lower than in the adjacent intertidal zone. Maximum values for chlorophyll were recorded in the intertidal zone (492 mg chl a m-2). Average values for extractable organic carbon were 67.1 g C m-2 in the intertidal and 61.7 g C m-2 in the supratidal zone. Calculated average microbial production ranged from 249.4 gC m-2 yr-1 in the intertidal zone to 250.2 gC m-2 yr-1 in supratidal zone. Marine hemiedaphic supratidal communities are characterized by Lumbricillus enteromorphae and L. lineatus in lower saltmarsh habitats, Fridericia callosa in higher habitats and Enchytraeus albidus in both zones. Characteristic collembolan species are Tullbergia krausbaueri and Folsomia sexoculata. Brackish supratidal habitats with higher salinities are characterized by Lumbricillus cf. helgolandicus and L. rivalis, with lower salinities by Fridericia alata, Fr. gracilis and Fr. bulbosa. Eiseniella tetraedra and Lumbricus rubellus inhabit stations with average salinities below 2.5 ppt. In the epitidal station zone Marionina communis, M. minutus and Enchytraeus lacteus, and earthworms occur.

TTMs Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Sr, V, and Hg along with sediment texture, OC, and CaCO(3) were analyzed in 36 surface sediments collected during August 2008 to recognize and observe the input of TTMs in the marsh from various sources in the city limits. In view of the rapid urbanization and industrialization in Chennai City, especially on the southern side, uncontrolled input of sewage, garbage, and industrial effluents into the Pallikaranai marsh land, the elevated concentrations are not surprising. The level of enrichment of TTMs has also increased by 20% to 60% for most of the elements when compared with all other ecosystems in the world as well as the nearby area. The results also indicate that the marshy region is more heavily contaminated with Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn than other regions on the southeast coast of India. The Enrichment Factor, Contamination Factor, and I (geo) indexes are calculated, and these values are useful to assess the degree of pollution in sediments. The spatial distributions of TTMs are also controlled by other factors like geochemical, precipitation, and flocculation of particulate substances in the marsh.

During the Summer of 2009, a vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh north of Mary Hammock. In addition, tree stumps buried under the marsh were recorded, and one was extracted and analyzed, to facilitate in understanding the sedimentological history of the marsh. A GPS unit was used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites and stumps. The cores were then transported to the Georgia Southern Coastal Research Lab at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), in Savannah, GA, for analysis. The tree stump was brought back to the University of Georgia for analysis. Although there was a large degree of bioturbation in the marsh near Mary Hammock, sediment core analysis (visual inspection, X-Ray analysis, particle size analysis, and analysis of organic matter content), and stump analysis (species determination and radiocarbon dating), revealed three main facies in the marsh. The topmost layer is recent marsh. The middle layer is a sandy layer, representing the former upland surface prior to sea level rise, inundation, and marsh formation (around 5,000 to 4,000 years ago). The bottom layer is a highly compact greenish-gray clay layer. The conclusion is that the former upland surface, consisting mostly of sandy soils, was inundated due to sea level rise around 4,200 B.P. Marsh sedimentation occurred after this, depositing fine-grained sediments on top of the sandy surface (Turck and Alexander, 2013).",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331728",NA

We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.","10.1186/s13717-021-00340-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331748",NA

In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). The distribution of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter. They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity). Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake. Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens. The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland. Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions. We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake. Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community. The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials. Most of the annuals frequently co-occurred with Sagittaria lancifolia, which was the shortest in stature and had the least persistent canopy of the three mid-seasonal dominant perennials.","10.1007/BF00033019","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331751","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025635425&doi=10.1007%2fBF00033019&partnerID=40&md5=bdf75999459af3cb82126a431dce3ca2"

However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.","10.1002/ldr.3538","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331759","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078656687&doi=10.1002%2fldr.3538&partnerID=40&md5=23e583e88350f309dc61605d090b24bc"

Also, total soil organic carbon, diversity, plant cover and vegetation height were measured. Once this behaviour is known, the impacts of future climate scenarios may be approached. Since some of these variables could be altered by climate change, the future vegetation dynamics might indicate the trending of change, so plant communities can be used as bioindicators. The investigation was carried out in some small coastal wetlands located in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Low values of diversity were found in these plant communities due to a great effect of flooding, followed by salinity. 'Reed beds' are bioindicators of flooding and environmental disturbance. 'Saline rushes' are also flooding bioindicators and efficient accumulators of organic matter. 'Mediterranean halophilous scrubs' are bioindicators of seasonal flooding and changes to salinity. 'Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous scrubs' might be considered as bioindicators of low flooding and low salinity in anthropic environment while 'Mediterranean salt steppes' bioindicate driest conditions. At present, Mediterranean halophilous scrubs are the most widely extended community, which could be interpreted as a consequence of a changing and sharply seasonal climate. Our research suggests that future climate change scenarios involving flooding increases would support the proliferation of the lowest diversity and thus lower ecological value plant communities (i.e. reed beds). Conversely, a future scenario of decreasing flooding would benefit the most diverse and valuable conservation community actually priortized by European Habitats Directive (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia).","10.1007/s10531-017-1382-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331760",NA

Three major spatial clusters were identified in the upper intertidal zone from a dataset consisting of 111 contemporary samples: a high-to mid-elevation assemblage consisting of differing abundances of Entzia macrescens and Trochammina inflata; a mid-elevation assemblage comprised of Arenoparrella mexicana in association with Trochammina inflata and Quinqueloculina seminula; and mid-to low-elevation assemblage characterised by Cribroelphidium excavatum, Quinqueloculina seminula, Ammobaculites spp. and Miliammina fusca. Multivariate analysis correlated foraminiferal assemblages with environmental variables showing that foraminiferal distribution in the region is constrained primarily by wetland elevation, but also by pore-water salinity. Foraminiferal assemblages derived from cluster analysis correlated with vegetation zones, implying that both foraminifera and vegetation are influenced by elevation and salinity. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the consistency in spatial zonation of assemblages provides greater confidence that contemporary distribution of foraminiferal assemblages can assist with the interpretation of past depositional conditions and palaeo-environmental reconstructions, providing insights into the evolution of coastal wetlands of south-eastern Australia over the Holocene.","10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106949","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331763","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090215169&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106949&partnerID=40&md5=39a90a96bc59b4be76b5c729191307a5"
"CONF",14331766,"Deverel, SJ; Wang, BW; Rojstaczer, S","1998","Subsidence of organic soils, Sacramento San Joaquin Delta, California","The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta was reclaimed in the late 1800s when levees were built to convert this then tidal marshland into agricultural tracts and islands. Since then, land-surface elevations have declined, or subsided, by as much as 6 m. The spatial variability and causes of subsidence of organic soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were evaluated by analyzing historical leveling data and changes in land-surface elevations relative to powerpole foundations. Analysis of the historical leveling data indicate that subsidence rates are slowing, and the spatial variability in subsidence rates was largely explained by differences in soil organic matter content.The relation between land subsidence and organic matter oxidation was evaluated by measuring the gaseous and aqueous carbon flux and land-surface elevation changes in drained agricultural fields on three Delta islands. From July 1990 to May 1992, monthly gaseous CO2 fluxes were measured. The CO2 flux was used as an indicator of organic matter oxidation. Dissolved carbon fluxes were determined from the dissolved carbon loads in drainage ditches. Land-surface elevation changes were measured continuously by extensometers. The CO2 flux was strongly affected by soil temperature and also was related to the thickness of organic soils and soil moisture. Land-surface elevation fluctuated elastically with changes in ground-water elevation. The net, rates of inelastic subsidence ranged from 0.46 to 1.06cm/yr, Subsidence calculated from the CO2 fluxes generally agreed with subsidence measured during the monitoring period and explained about 60-76 percent of the variance in inelastic changes in land-surface elevation measurements, Estimates of dissolved organic carbon flux for all three islands were small relative to gaseous CO2 losses and represent less than 1 percent of the measured subsidence.To evaluate the hypothesis that converting drained agricultural areas into wetlands could aid in subsidence mitigation by slowing the oxidation. of the organic soils, carbon mass balances were determined on plots that were seasonally flooded, seasonally flooded and irrigated, and permanently flooded. Average fluxes were not significantly different between the irrigated and seasonally flooded plots. The carbon flux from the permanently flooded plot was about five times lower than the fluxes from the seasonally flooded and irrigated plots. Methane (CH4) was the primary gaseous carbon species in the permanently flooded plot.Carbon inputs were determined by harvesting and analyzing the accumulated, vegetative biomass. There was a net carbon gain in the permanently flooded plot and a net carbon loss in the irrigated and seasonally flooded plots. The net carbon gain and the field observation of vegetative accretion in the permanently flooded plot indicate that permanent flooding may be a way to reverse the effects of subsidence in the delta.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331766",NA

Water level management was designed to limit hydrologic exchange to the managed marsh by regulating the direction and rate of water flows. During a drawdown-flooding water management cycle, the unmanaged reference marshes had significantly higher vertical accretion rates, higher soil bulk density and soil mineral matter content, lower soil organic matter content, and higher rates of organic matter accumulation than the managed marsh. The rate of mineral matter accumulation was higher in both reference marshes, but was significantly higher in only one. Spatial variability in accumulation rates was low when analyzed in one managed marsh site, suggesting a primarily autochthonous source of matter. In contrast, the associated reference marsh apparently received allochthonous material that settled out in a distinct spatial pattern as water velocity decreased. The impoundment marshes experienced an accretion deficit of one full order of magnitude (0.1 vs. 1.0 cm/yr) based on comparison of accretion and sea level rise data, while the unmanaged reference marshes experienced a five-fold smaller deficit or no deficit. These data suggest that the gravity-drained impoundments likely have a shorter life expectancy than the reference marshes in the rapidly subsiding Louisiana coast.","10.2307/1942126","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331774","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028180763&doi=10.2307%2f1942126&partnerID=40&md5=efbfe258b659034ba003bd027607313f"

It is critically important to determine region-specific projections for these areas due to their specificities and vulnerabilities to climate change. This work aimed to value the impacts of recent climate changes at West Africa Sahara coastland, southern Morocco, at Khnifiss Lagoon. We have applied a combined approach using remote sensing techniques and environmental reconstructions based on high-resolution analysis of sediment cores, covering the current warm period. Remote sensing highlighted changes to the lagoon inlet, accompanied by a greater meandering character of the tidal channels. As a response, the sediment cores have recorded a predominant vegetation substitution due to changes in the tidal limit, and an increase in organic carbon accumulation was observed. For the current climatology, during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, winds reaching the coast strengthen in an east-to-west direction. In the Khnifiss Lagoon, whose inlet is dominated by the ebb tide, the intensity and direction of the winds on the coast at surface level modifies its connection to the ocean by increasing sediment transport toward the interior of the lagoon. Locally biological responses to wind intensification, and possibly sea-level rise, exemplify the lagoon sensitivity to large-scale processes. Coastal vegetated wetlands are considered to be highly dynamic environments. However, we expect a loss of the upper tidal vegetation due to boundary conditions limiting the accommodation space in this arid environment in a possible future scenario of continuously inland tidal line displacement.","10.1002/lno.11992","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331781",NA

Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg. Conservation and monitoring of saltmarshes should be taken into consideration also from this environmental point of view.","10.1007/s11368-016-1618-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331791",NA

One site was located on the intertidal portion of a sand flat, deposited during a coastal storm in October 1991. The other site was an undisturbed, fringing marsh aged at 14 to 16 yr, Three sampling stations were established at equivalent elevations at both sites. At the marsh site, these sampling stations represented tall and short forms of Spartina alterniflora (low and intermediate elevation stations) and a high marsh zone of mostly Spartina patens (high elevation station). At both sites, sediment across the intertidal zone was characterized by <1.5% organic matter and >90% sand. Relative to the marsh site, the sand flat site had significantly higher pore water salinity and redox potential at the upper elevation stations, higher pH at all stations, and lower hydrogen sulfide at the 2 lower elevation stations. Organically bound nutrients generally were higher in the root zone of the marsh site, but inorganic nutrients were an order of magnitude higher at the low elevation station of the sand flat compared to all stations at the marsh site. The higher concentration of nutrients at the sand flat site may arise from a nutrient-sich mud flat buried during the storm event. This high concentration of nutrients could serve as an external nutrient source to the root zone of the developing marsh and may also lead to a net export of inorganic nutrients to the flooding tidal water. A predictable zonation of intertidal vegetation on the sand flat should exist given the present patterns in sediment physico-chemistry. Based on nutrient standing stocks, the most favorable growing conditions for S. alterniflora exist at the low elevation station of the sand flat, where the tall form of this species is expected to dominate. The short form of S, alterniflora is expected to colonize the intermediate elevation station. A mixed community of species (S, patens, Distichlis spicata) probably will develop at the high elevation station, where the sediment is most oxidized. Vegetation zonation at the marsh site was not readily explained by patterns in sediment physico-chemistry measured in this study. Current research by the authors indicates that nutrient dynamics, controlled by subsurface hydrology, dictates nutrient supply at the marsh site and leads to a higher exposure to nutrients in the root zone of the tall form of S. alterniflora. The present study represents one of few involving measurements of sediment physico-chemistry in naturally developing marshes during the initial stages of development.","10.3354/meps120271","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331805",NA

This is probably a result of decreasing sedimentation rates and organic carbon concentrations with increasing water depth.

On average, lipid biomarker compounds extracted from the plants were depleted in C-13 by 3-5 parts per thousand relative to delta(13)C total organic carbon (TOC). However, individual compounds within each lipid class varied by up to 5.6 parts per thousand. Trends in the isotopic compositions of lipids were consistent with delta(13)C(TOC); compounds obtained from Z. marina were the most enriched in C-13 and those from J. roemerianus were the most depleted. The range in isotopic abundances and molecular compositions of the sediments was greater than that obtained from the plants, indicating that additional, presently unidentified sources of organic matter contribute to the Cape Lookout Eight sediments. Similarity between the signatures for suspended particulate matter and the sediments indicates that much of the sedimentary organic matter is derived from algal and bacterial sources.

However, the roles of the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence in regulating soil dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction processes (denitrification (DNF), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANA) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) remains unclear. The objective of this study was therefore to reveal the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance.We investigated plant biomass, soil properties, NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance of NO3 (-) reduction pathways following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequences of 6, 10, and 14 years compared to Cyperus malaccensis in a coastal wetland of southeastern China.The S. alterniflora invasion generally increased plant biomass, soil water content, available substrates, nirS, anammox bacterial 16S rRNA and nrfA gene abundance, but it decreased soil bulk density. Soil DNF, ANA and DNRA rates in stands of S. alterniflora ranged from 1.52 to 17.58, 0.31 to 1.27 and 0.14 to 2.01 nmol N g(-1) h(-1), respectively, which were generally higher than the values in stands of C. malaccensis. The soil NO3 (-) reduction rates generally increased with the increasing chronosequence of invasion by S. alterniflora, while the changes in DNF and ANA rates were less pronounced than changes in DNRA. DNF was the dominant pathway (70.00-92.41%), and the ANA and DNRA contributed 2.49-15.27% and 5.10-20.75% to the total NO3 (-) reduction, respectively. The contributions of DNF and ANA to the total NO3 (-) reduction decreased slightly, while the contribution of DNRA increased remarkably after S. alterniflora invasion. Soil NO3 (-) reduction processes were influenced by available substrates and associated microbial activities. It is estimated that an N loss of approximately 520.97 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in C. malaccensis and 794.46 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in S. alterniflora were linked to both DNF and ANA processes.The S. alterniflora invasion altered soil NO3 (-) reduction processes by increasing soil microbial activities and available substrates and thus may further mediate the soil N availability in the coastal wetlands.","10.1007/s11104-017-3464-x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331813",NA

Control of invasive plants often relies on herbicides, although little is known about subsequent environmental impacts. Studying effects of herbicides on non-target species and long-term cascading consequences may yield insights into the ecology of invasive species by revealing interactions with native species. We conducted a long-term field experiment measuring effects of treating the invasive saltmarsh grass, Spartina anglica, with the herbicide Fusilade Forte (R). No changes in sedimentary macrofaunal abundances or species richness, diversity, or assemblages were detected 1-2 months after spraying, despite known toxicity of Fusilade Forte to fauna. This lack of impact may have been due to low exposure, since the herbicide was taken up primarily by plant leaves, with the small amount that reached the sediment hydrolyzing rapidly. Six months after spraying, however, total macrofauna in treated plots was more than four times more abundant than in unsprayed control plots, due to a fifteen-fold increase in annelids. This population growth correlated with increased sedimentary organic matter in treated plots, likely due to decomposition of dead S. anglica leaves serving as food for annelids. After another year, no differences in macrofauna or organic matter remained between treatments. The indirect effect on annelid populations from herbicide treatment could benefit management efforts by providing greater food resources for wading birds, in addition to improving birds' access to sediments by reducing plant cover. This study shows that an invasive grass can have a significant impact on native fauna through food-web interactions, influenced by herbicide usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentration of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in soils (pseudototal and bioavailable) and in plants (roots and shoots) was determined. Then the enrichment factor, bioaccumulation and translocation factor were calculated. The soil mineralogy and the behavior of these metals according to different soil variables were discussed.

This study contributes to deciphering Holocene RSL changes at the German North Sea coast in high resolution by developing a transfer function for RSL change. Recent associations of Foraminifera and Ostracoda from low intertidal to supratidal settings of the barrier island of Spiekeroog in combination with environmental parameters (granulomeny, C/N, total organic carbon, salinity) were investigated and quantified in elevation steps of 15 cm in order to generate a first transfer function (TF) of Holocene RSL change. In a future step, the TF can be applied to the stratigraphic record. Our data show a clear vertical zonation of foraminifer and ostracod taxa between the middle salt marsh and the tidal flat with very few individuals in the sand flat area, suggesting removal by the tidal current or poor preservation. Multivariate statistics identify the elevation, corresponding to the inundation frequency, as main driving factor. The smallest vertical error (49 cm) is associated with an entirely new approach of combining Foraminifera and Ostracoda for a TF. Advantages of the TF over classical RSL indicators such as basal and intercalated peats - beside the relatively narrow indicative meaning - include the possible application to a wide range of intertidal facies and that the resulting RSL curve does not depend on compaction-prone peats.","10.20341/gb.2019.007","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331834","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073560714&doi=10.20341%2fgb.2019.007&partnerID=40&md5=cf10d815378c2d5b2a45df234e349f7f"

Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and stable isotopic ratios of carbon (delta C-13) ranged from 0.62 to 2.74 %, 0.09 to 0.25 % and -27.5 to 21.7%, respectively.

The TOC/TN ratios and delta C-13 suggest a mixture of marine-and terrestrial-derived organic matter in the surface sediments with increasing contributions from marine-derived organic matter towards the seaward side. Long-chain n-alkanes derived from higher plants predominated the inner part of the estuary, while short-chain n-alkanes derived from planktonic sources predominated the bar mouth region. The even carbon preference of the C-12-C-22 n-alkanes may refer to the direct biogenic contribution from bacteria, fungi and yeast species and to the potential direct petroleum inputs. The presence of odd mid-chain n-alkanes in the sediments indicates the organic matter inputs from submerged and floating macrophytes (water hyacinth). Various molecular indices such as carbon preference index, terrestrial to aquatic ratio, average chain length and the ratios of mid-chain n-alkanes support the aforementioned inferences. The high contribution of odd and branched chain fatty acids along with very low contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggest the effective utilisation of algae-derived organic matter by bacteria and the effective recycling of labile organic matter in whole settling and deposition processes. The distributional variability of n-alkanes and fatty acids reveals the preferential utilisation of marine-derived organic matter and the selective preservation of terrestrial-derived organic matter in surface sediments of the Cochin estuary.","10.1007/s10661-015-4308-x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331835",NA

In order to compare distinct patterns of hydrocarbon accumulation in mudflats, salt marsh and mangrove, sediments from two transects (control and impacted areas) were sampled in Paranagua Bay, SW Atlantic. Concentrations of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and petroleum biomarkers (hopanes, terpanes and steranes) were determined, as well as bulk parameters (TOC, grain size and delta C-13). N-alkanes concentrations were similar between control and impacted sites (respectively, 3.03 +/- 1.20 mu g g(-1) and 4.11 +/- 3.02 mu g g(-1) ) and reflected a high biogenic input. Conversely, PAHs and petroleum biomarker concentrations were three to six times higher in impacted site than the control site (respectively, 60.4 +/- 23.3 ng g(-1) and 22.0 +/- 25.0 ng g(-1) for PAHs and 197.7 +/- 51.8 ng g(-1) and 40.2 +/- 32. ng g(-1), for hopanes). Despite these differences, concentrations were lower than those reported for highly impacted areas worldwide. Diagnostic ratios and hydrocarbon parameters (e.g. total PAHs and total petroleum biomarkers) helped to distinguish human impact in the ecological zones, suggesting different sources and/or levels of weathering, confirmed by ANOVA tests. TOC played a fundamental role to the concentration of hydrocarbons, showing similar distributions along the transects. Petroleum biomarkers could clearly indicate the preferential sites of deposition and assign different levels of anthropic contamination by hydrocarbons, thus providing clear information about the chronic petroleum pollution in coastal sediments.

In the present work, the impacts of S. alterniflora colonization on SOC pool and stability was deciphered to better understand how alien species altered the carbon cycle in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). SOC contents were in the range of 1.29 g/kg-7.02 g/kg, of which wetlands covered by S. alterniflora increased with colonization time and exceed those in wetlands covered by native species after 7 years. Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that aromatic moieties were predominant components of SOC, and there were remarkable increase trends of phenol and lignin compounds and decrease trend of aromatic moieties with S. alterniflora invasion time. SA had the highest microorganism biomass reflected by phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) across different wetlands. Salinity had the largest negative effects while nutrients had the largest positive effects on the SOC pool. The proportion of decomposition-resistant compounds (including aromatics, lignin, and phenol) to total SOC was decreasing while the SOC pool was increasing with S. alterniflora invasion time. This study demonstrated that S. alterniflora invasion could promote the SOC pool but weaken its stability in the wetlands of the YRD. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment enhancement of both marsh and interior pond sites had significant, immediate, and long-lasting effects on physical soil properties and nutrient status with increased bulk density and inorganic nitrogen. Vegetative cover and productivity response were minimal for deteriorating vegetated marshes with the short-term response data showing no significant impact of sediment enhancement and long-term trends indicating decreasing productivity over time.

As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

This high marsh, dominated by Spartina patens, has a vertical accretion rate of similar to 2.5 mm/yr, significantly lower than the 6-7 mm/yr accretion rate of low marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Accelerating sea-level rise will eventually cause the high marsh to transition to low marsh; the rate of this change is controlled, in part, by the contribution of inorganic sediment. Temporal and spatial variability of inorganic marsh sedimentation during the past similar to 2.5 ka was examined at the Great Marsh, Massachusetts, using twenty cores, each similar to 180cm long, along five transects. Transects were aligned perpendicular to bays and major channels at different compass quadrants to assess influences of wind and tidal flow during storms. Cores were sampled every 20 cm to determine percent organic matter (loss on ignition) and grain size distribution (using a laser particle size analyzer). Data show a weak correlation for grain size versus distance from the nearest channel or bay. Additionally, no consistent vertical trends in grain size were observed, either within individual sampling sites nor among coring transects. Instead, we find coarsening upwards trends at some sites, likely due to increased channelization and tidal velocity as the marsh matured. Elsewhere, sediments fine upwards in response to deepening bays and channels. Finally, transects exhibiting variable grain size trends are likely influenced by ice rafted sediment. These results demonstrate the complexity of sedimentation on the marsh platform and the challenge in accurately predicting patterns of sediment transport using a single suspended grain size in hydrodynamic models in these systems.","10.2112/SI95-095.1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331876","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085505829&doi=10.2112%2fSI95-095.1&partnerID=40&md5=8cc10c683a90893970e00256f9636aa2"

In a created marsh in southern California (USA), we tested the individual and combined effects of two epibenthic invertebrates on nutrient and biomass pools, community structure, and physical habitat features. We manipulated snail (Cerithidea californica) and crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) presence in field enclosures planted with pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at elevations matching the plant's lower extent in an adjacent natural marsh. In the 4-month experiment, C. californica altered habitat structure by reducing sediment surface heterogeneity and shear strength (a measure of sediment stability) markedly throughout the enclosures. Both invertebrates had strong negative effects on a group of correlated sediment physicochemical characteristics, including nitrogen and organic matter concentrations and soil moisture. In addition, both invertebrates greatly reduced benthic chlorophyll a, a proxy for biomass of microphytobenthos. Compared to controls, macroalgal cover was up to sixfold lower with crabs present, while snails increased cover at low elevations of enclosures. Unexpectedly, macroalgal cover was eliminated with both species present, perhaps through P. crassipes consumption of larger thalli and C. californica reduction in cover of recruits. Neither species influenced the S. virginica canopy (quantified with an index of branch length and number); however, at the lower elevation of enclosures, the two species together negatively impacted the plant canopy. The two invertebrates' modifications to our experimental marshes led to distinct suites of biotic and physicochemical features depending on their presence or co-occurrence, with the latter producing several unexpected results. We propose that the roles and interactions of habitat-modifying fauna deserve further attention, particularly in the context of efforts to conserve and restore the processes found in natural systems.","10.1007/s00442-005-0015-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331904","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23944472380&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-005-0015-6&partnerID=40&md5=cbb373f28714e0d0d7f44f7ff40e2137"

Microbial activity is important in providing wetland biogeochemical functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, but there is little known about sediment microbial communities in Phragmites marshes. Microbial populations associated with invasive Phragmites vegetation and with native salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, may differ in the relative abundance of microbial taxa (community structure) and in the ability of this biota to decompose organic substrates (community biogeochemical function). This study compares sediment microbial communities associated with Phragmites and Spartina vegetation in an undisturbed brackish marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey (MUL), and in a brackish marsh in the anthropogenically affected Hackensack Meadowlands (SMC). We use phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and enzymatic activity to profile sediment microbial communities associated with both plants in each site. Sediment analyses include bulk density, total organic matter, and root biomass. PLFA profiles indicate that the microbial communities differ between sites with the undisturbed site exhibiting greater fatty acid richness (62 PLFA recovered from MUL versus 38 from SMC). Activity of the 5 enzymes analyzed (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, chitobiase, and 2 oxidases) was higher in the undisturbed site. Differences between vegetation species as measured by Principal Components Analysis were significantly greater at the undisturbed MUL site than at SMC, and patterns of enzyme activity and PLFAs did not correspond to patterns of root biomass. We suggest that in natural wetland sediments, macrophyte rhizosphere effects influence the community composition of sediment microbial populations. Physical and chemical site disturbances may impose limits on these rhizosphere effects, decreasing sediment microbial diversity and potentially, microbial biogeochemical functions.","10.1007/BF02823723","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331905","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038383595&doi=10.1007%2fBF02823723&partnerID=40&md5=5a70ca19d67bfba1e1450e61913561de"

Annual emission rates varied widely, ranging from 3.10 mg/m(2)/hr (Bay of Bengal) to 21.56 mg/m(2)/hr (Adyar River), based on nature of the perturbance to each of the ecosystems studied. Distinct seasonality in methane emission was noticed in an unpolluted ecosystem (mangrove: 7.38 mg/m(2)/hr) and over a twofold increase was evident in the ecosystem that was disturbed by human activities (21.56 mg/m(2)/hr). The wide ranges in estimate suggest that methanogenesis occurs by both natural and anthropogenic activities in these coastal wetlands. Several physical and chemical factors such as salinity, sulfate, oxygen, and organic matter content influenced methanogenesis to a large degree in each of these ecosystems in addition to individual responses to human-induced stress. For example, there was a clear negative correlation between oxygen availability (0.99), sulfate (0.98), and salinity (0.98) with CH(4) emission in the Adyar river ecosystem. Although similar results were obtained for the other wetland ecosystems, CH(4) emission was largely influenced by tidal fluctuations, resulting in a concomitant increase in methanogenesis with high sulfate concentrations. This study demonstrates that coastal wetlands are potentially significant sources of atmospheric methane and could be a greater source if anthropogenic perturbations continue at the current rate.","10.1007/s002670010169","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331911",NA

Through sampling of dated sediment cores, we identified indicators of historical land use change (past 150 yr) in a microtidal northern Gulf of Mexico tidal creek system in the early stages of urbanization. We found that tidal creeks differed from open water sites, and urbanized sites differed from less altered sites, primarily due to changes in carbon sources indicated by differences in sediment stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values, and concentrations of fecal indicator bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Total organic carbon (%TOC) and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) increased twofold in tidal creeks during upstream urbanization in the early 20th century, which led to elevated mid-century sediment TOC accumulation rates (5-10 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)), followed by decreases in TOC accumulation in tidal creeks and open waters since the 1960s (0.4-1.8 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)). C. perfringens and nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) were, respectively, 1.8 and 1.5 times higher at wastewater-influenced sites than at other sites, increasing through time or remaining high at wastewater-influenced sites from approximately the 1950s-present, when human populations quadrupled. Hence, urbanization altered estuarine inputs from upland C sources and increased inputs from human-derived N and microbes. These findings suggest that tidal creeks are more sensitive archives of land-use change than open water systems due to their proximity and greater connectivity to the watershed.","10.1002/lno.10453","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331914",NA

The vegetation, many physical and chemical properties (e.g. pH, C-org, salinity, Fe-od, exchangeable cations, CEC) of the Spiekeroog Fluvisols are similar to those of the mainland. However, the Spiekeroog soil profiles extended over the marsh sediments, and the sand sediments below and they contained more silt and less clay and carbonate (0.3 - 34.5 g kg(-1)) than the soils of the mainland. A survey proved carbonate-free areas. The relatively moderate S dynamics showed a spatial and temporal stabile SO4-S-fraction (0.3 - 0.6 mg g(-1)), a fairly stabile HNO3-HCl-S fraction (1.5 - 2.9 mg g(-1)), but a variable HCI-S fraction. The vertical Cs-137 distribution showed peaks at 3 - 4 and 7 - 8 cm soil depth, indicating sedimentation rates of 0.2 - 0.5 cm a(-1). The results showed that moderate S dynamics lead to carbonate losses which are not compensated because of low sedimentation rates. Consequently, the Spiekeroog Salic Fluvisols will enter the terrestrial phase of soil development without carbonate. Thus, besides the usual pedogenesis of Eutric Fluvisols via Salic and Calcaric Fluvisols, the investigation proved a direct development from Salic to Eutric Fluvisols.","10.1002/jpln.200390057","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331918",NA

This study compared the diversity among three communities in a wetland to assess the impact of invasion by Phragmites and the associated impact on soil properties. Three diversity indices, species richness (S), evenness (E) and Shanon-Weiner index (H) had significantly higher values in uninvaded plots compared to invaded in all the communities. Invaded plots had the lowest diversity, with H = 0 and Simpson's index (D) = 1, (i.e. they were monospecific). These results support the idea that a reduction in diversity can be expected in wetlands colonized by Phragmites. Phragmites invasion significantly increased soil moisture, EC, phenolics, organic carbon, dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass (C, N, P) with reduction of pH and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi spore density compared with uninvaded zones.

The sediments were clayey silts in cores from the upper/lower estuary and sand-dominated in cores from the middle estuary/bay. Organic carbon (OC) content varied from 0.5 to 4%, with higher values in fine-grained sediments. The mean Fe and Mn contents of sediments from the upper/middle estuary were 3-5 times and 8-13 times, respectively higher than the reference sediment (RS) from the same estuary. The mean Fe and Mn contents of sediments from the lower estuary/bay were close to the RS. Strong inter-metal correlation among Ti, V, Cr and Zr in all the cores indicated their contribution from a common source, probably the laterites from hinterland. Trace metals were more enriched in fine-grained sediments than in sand dominated sediments. Early diagenetic control on the redistribution of metal is evident in core sediments from the middle estuary to Bay. The distribution of Mo, U and Pb followed that of Fe and Mn in the upper estuary and OC in the lower estuary/bay. Our results indicated strong anthropogenic contribution of metals from ore deposits in the upper/middle estuary. The Mn and Cr contents of sediment in the upper/middle estuary and Fe in the middle estuary were highly enriched suggestive of 'significant pollution signal'. More trace metals from the middle estuary were moderately enriched. Speciation studies showed Mn and Pb occurred abundantly in non-residual phases. High Mn content and its high percentage in exchangeable and reductive phases indicate that it was susceptible to be mobilized. However, Fe, Cu and Ni occurred abundantly in residual phases and less percentage of them were expected to be bio-available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In that case, it might be possible to reduce the salinity of the final effluent, which is a crucial parameter for wastewater reuse in agriculture. During this study three halophytes, Atriplex halimus, Juncus acutus and Sarcocornia perennis, were tested for phyto-desalination of domestic wastewater in a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and compared with common reeds (Phraglnites australis). In addition, the effect of this alternative vegetation on the overall performance of the system regarding organic matter, nutrients, boron and pathogen removal was monitored. The organic loading rate (OLR) was about 21 gCOD/m(2)/d and the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was 95 mm/d in both cases. Promising results were obtained for A. halimus, which shows high biomass productivity and significant capability to accumulate salts, mainly Na, in its tissues. A positive effect on pathogen removal efficiency Was also recorded. However, nitrogen concentration in the effluent of the VFCW planted with halophytes was found to be higher than in the effluent of the VFCW planted with reeds.

In this study, 300 surface sediments were collected from 15 stations in the Jiulong River Estuary, southeast China, across four different seasons, in order to reveal the spatiotemporal variability of biogenic elements and their influencing factors in the subtropical coastal mangrove wetland. The biogenic elements including carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (C, N, and S) were determined by an element analyzer, while the phosphorus (P) was determined by a flow injection analyzer. The concentrations of biogenic elements showed no significant differences among four seasons except total phosphorus (TP); however, our ANOVA analyses revealed a distinct spatial pattern which was closely related with the vegetation type and tidal level. Values of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface sediment of mangrove vegetation zones were higher than those in the cordgrass and mudflat zones. The concentrations of TC, TN, TP, and total sulfur (TS) in the high tidal zones were higher than those in the middle and low tidal zones. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that tidal level, vegetation type, and season had some significant influence on the distribution of biogenic elements in the Jiulong River Estuary, by explaining 18.2, 7.7, and 4.9 % of total variation in the four biogenic elements, respectively. In conclusion, S. alterniflora invasion had substantial effects on the distributions of biogenic elements in the subtropical coastal wetland. If regional changes in the Jiulong River Estuary are to persist and much of the mangrove vegetation was to be replaced by cordgrass, there would be significant decreases on the overall storage of C and N in this coastal zone. Therefore, the native mangrove reforestation and exotic cordgrass elimination should be a priority in mangrove sustainable management for coastal ecosystem health.","10.1007/s11356-014-3568-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331937",NA

The BSAFs were lowest during the local rainy season. During the dry season, BSAFs were lowest in the high intertidal zone closest to shore. Significant differences among species groups were also observed; BSAFs were lowest in polychaetes and highest in the asian clam (Potamocorbula amurensis), varying over almost three orders of magnitude (0.0069-5.4 g sediment organic C/g lipid). The BSAFs decreased with increasing percent fines in the sediments and with PAH concentrations on an organic carbon basis. We suggest that a determining variable is the content of highly aromatic soot particles, which increases during periods of surface runoff and which is expected in the dry season to be highest in the high intertidal zone where these finer particles preferentially accumulate. Correlations of BSAFs with the ratio of the logarithm of the activity coefficients in porewaters to those in sediments were generally stronger than with log K-ow indicating a limitation of octanol as a surrogate for sediment organic carbon or organism lipid. These observations qualify but also strengthen the concept of equilibrium partitioning as the determining factor in bioaccumulation by benthic organisms of nonpolar organic compounds from sediments; the assumption that ''organic carbon'' can be considered in generic terms without allowance for aromaticity and probably other factors as well, must, however, be reconsidered.","10.1897/1551-5028(1997)016<1087:TBOPAH>2.3.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331939","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030949084&doi=10.1897%2f1551-5028%281997%29016%3c1087%3aTBOPAH%3e2.3.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=4959e3cd9f34afee15e1dbc0a7a0595a"

Because the majority of anthropogenic contaminants are either directly or indirectly derived from fossil fuels that are devoid of C-14, radiocarbon can be used as a natural inverse tracer of contaminant carbon in the contemporary environment. Here, C-14 analysis of individual microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was used to characterize the carbon sources utilized by the active microbial community in salt marsh sediments contaminated by the Florida oil spill of 1969 in Wild Harbor, West Falmouth, MA. A specific goal was to determine whether this community is actively degrading petroleum residues that persist in these sediments. The Delta C-14 values of microbial PLFA in all sediment horizons (contaminated and noncontaminated) matched the Delta C-14 of the total sedimentary organic carbon after petroleum removal, indicating that no measurable metabolism of petroleum residues was occurring. This result agrees with ancillary data such as the delta C-13 content and distribution of PLFA, and the residual hydrocarbon composition determined by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) analysis. We hypothesize that microbes have chosen to respire the natural organic matter rather than the residual petroleum hydrocarbons because the former is more labile. Future efforts directed at determining indices of microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons should consider competition with natural organic matter.","10.1021/es048669j","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331941","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17644393210&doi=10.1021%2fes048669j&partnerID=40&md5=6681c0fc2008ab57b99b3bcd8c56cb7f"

Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well.","10.1007/s11356-012-0794-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331948","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871720925&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-0794-3&partnerID=40&md5=55d3c107edbc67444631ef58f9b689fe"

We studied effects of elevation, sediment characteristics, vegetation, and tidal cycles on waterfowl feeding and food organisms in Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada from September to March 1990-1992. Percent dry mass of esophageal contents was mainly Zostera japonica leaves (84%) for American wigeon (Anas americana Gmelin), and leaves of Z. japonica (57%) and Z. marina (41%) for brant (Branta bernicla L.). Northern pintails (A. acuta L.) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos L.) ate mostly the leaves, seeds, and rhizomes of Z. japonica (48 and 72%, respectively) and gastropods (12 and 28%). Green-winged teal (A. crecca L.) ate mainly amphipods (68%) and saltmarsh seeds (19%). The well-sorted fine sand (median 0.125 mm) to medium sand (0.25 mm), and the low organic carbon content (1.31 +/-0.12% dry mass), did not appear to vary sufficiently along 2.1- and 2.6-km transects to affect macroinvertebrate distributions. Three habitat zones were recognized: (1) upper intertidal (sandflats); (2) mid-intertidal (largely monotypic Z. japonica); and (3) lower intertidal (mixed Z. japonica and Z. marina). These zones, although related to elevation, had greater influence on amphipod distributions than did elevation alone or detrital biomass. Biomass and numbers of most invertebrate foods of waterfowl were greatest in the eelgrass zones, with the upper elevational limit of Z. japonicn occurring at about Mean Water Level (MWL). Accordingly, wigeon, pintails, and mallards fed mostly below MWL. Because of seasonal tidal cycles, daily accessibility of areas below MWL but within reach of surface-feeding waterfowl decreased from a mean of 10.8 h in October to 9.6 h in December. In October only 10 d had <12 h available feeding time, whereas in December and January every day had <12 h available feeding time. Seasonal effects of tides on accessibility might limit sufficient feeding by some waterfowl species in intertidal areas, increasing their reliance on alternative feeding sites.","10.1007/BF00350084","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331966","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028162888&doi=10.1007%2fBF00350084&partnerID=40&md5=6bca40d6bd4f6d929c915186d9713bfa"

To understand the intertidal ecosystem development, high-frequency bed-level change data are thus needed. However, such datasets are scarce due to the lack of suitable methods that do not involve excessive labour and/or instrument cost. By applying newly-developed Surface Elevation Dynamics sensors (SED-sensors), we obtained unique high-resolution daily bed-level change data sets in the period 2013-2017 from 10 saltmarsh sites situated in the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain in contrasting physical and biological settings. At each site, multiple sensors were deployed for 9-20 months to ensure sufficient spatial and temporal coverage of highly variable bed level change processes. The bed level change data are provided with synchronized hydrodynamic data, i.e. water level, wave height, tidal current velocity, and medium grain size (D50) as well as (for some sites) chlorophyll-a level and organic matter content of the surface sediment. This dataset has revealed diverse spatial morphodynamic patterns over daily to seasonal scales, which are valuable to theoretical and model development. On the daily scale, this dataset is particularly instructive as it includes a number of storm events, the response to which can be detected in the bed level change observations.

The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis.

Some environmental factors, including available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and organic matter of the sediment , were significantly different between invasive S. alterniflora and natural Phragmites australis zones (P<0.05). The variations of the composition and distribution of the benthic macroinvertebrate functional groups were determined by the combination of multiple environmental factors, while the main factors varied with groups. Nutrient content and salinity of the sediment were the most important factors driving the abundance and biomass of the functional groups, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the comprehensive effects of various environmental variables including hydrology, vegetation and sediment when we examine the distribution characteristics and underlying mechanism of functional groups of benthic macroinvertebrate.","10.13292/j.1000-4890.202003.008","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14331987",NA

In this paper we document the contrasting effects of ecosystem engineering by the cordgrass Spartina maritima and the burrowing sandprawn Callianassa kraussi on physico-chemical characteristics, microflora, macrofaunal community structure and morphological attributes in the high shore intertidal sandflats of Langebaan Lagoon, a marine-dominated system on the west coast of South Africa. Comparisons were made at six sites in the lagoon within Spartina and Callianassa beds, and in a ""bare zone"" of sandflat between these two habitats that lacks both sandprawns and cordgrass. Sediments in Spartina habitats were consolidated by the root-shoot systems of the cordgrass, leading to low sediment penetrability, while sediments in beds of C. kraussi were more penetrable, primarily due to the destabilising effects of sandprawn bioturbation. Sediments in the ""bare zone"" had intermediate to low values of penetrability. Sediment organic content was lowest in bare zones and greatest in Spartina beds, while sediment chl-a levels were greatest on bare sand, but were progressively reduced in the Spartina and Callianassa beds. These differences among habitats induced by ecosystem engineering in turn affected the macrofauna. Community structure was different between all three habitats sampled, with species richness being surprisingly greater in Callianassa beds than either the bare zone or Spartina beds. In general, the binding of surface sediments by the root systems of Spartina favoured rigid-bodied, surface-dwelling and tube-building species, while the destabilising effect of bioturbation by C kraussi favoured burrowing species. The contrasting effects of these ecosystem engineers suggest that they play important roles in increasing habitat heterogeneity. Importantly, the role of bioturbation by C. kraussi in enhancing macrofaunal richness was unexpected. By loosening sediments, reducing anoxia and enhancing organic content, C. kraussi may engineer these high shore habitats to ameliorate environmental stresses or increase food availability.

Using shallow water ponds rehabititated with a technique called marsh terracing, we examined the quality of nekton habitat created, using and comparing several metrics including nekton density and diversity, functional group composition, and weight-length relationships as indirect measures of habitat quality. We examined three paired terraced and unterraced marsh ponds in southwest Louisiana. Nekton, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and soil and water quality variables were sampled bimonthly from April 2004 through April 2005 at four subtidal habitat types: terraced nearshore, terraced open water, unterraced nearshore, and unterraced open water. Results indicate that terraced ponds had increased the habitat value of degrading unterraced ponds over open water areas for estuarine nekton; nekton density and richness were similar between terraced and unterraced nearshore habitat types, but greater at all nearshore as compared to open water sites. Analysis of the distribution of nekton functional groups and weight:length ratios indicates the terraced and unterraced pond habitats were not functioning similarly: distribution of nekton functional groups differed significantly between habitat types with greater percentages of benthic-oriented species at unterraced open water habitats and higher percentage of open water species in terraced ponds as compared to unterraced ponds, and two of the six numerically dominant fish species had greater weight-length relationships in unterraced ponds as compared to terraced ponds. This lack of functional equivalency may be attributed to environmental differences between terraced and unterraced ponds such as water depth or SAV biomass, or the relatively young age of the terraces studied, which may not have allowed for the development of some critical habitat variables, such as soil organic matter that was found to be significantly lower in terraced versus unterraced ponds (p < 0.05). To properly assess the ecological equivalency of restored or rehabilitated sites for nekton requires that we move beyond measures of nekton density, biomass, and diversity and incorporate measures of functional equivalency, including habitat measures.","10.1007/BF03036518","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332004",NA

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that the largest number of discriminating bacterial and archaeal taxa was found in TW. The Mantel test and Spearman correlation analysis showed that environmental variables (i.e. salinity, soil organic matter and soil texture) influenced the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure.

Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates. Based on both analyses, the coastal Louisiana total marsh area (1,433,700 ha) accumulates about 2.7 to 3.3 Tg C year(-1).

The sediment grain size and total organic carbon (TOC) content are strongly variable and the salinity and temperature ranges were 10-31 parts per thousand and 9-30 degrees C, respectively, at the time of sampling (July to October) but temperatures down to freezing occur during the winter. The species are divided into six environmental categories of which the first five comprise euryhaline and the sixth essentially stenohaline taxa: (I) species associated only with marsh plants, (2) species basically, but not entirely, associated with marsh plants, (3) species basically, but not entirely, restricted to non-marsh areas, (4) species solely recorded in non-marsh intertidal to subtidal environments, (5) species restricted to subtidal areas, (6) species basically living in the most open marine areas. in this region, marshes have a patchy distribution and they are small and compressed due to low tidal ranges (<40 cm). Balticammina pseudomacrescens (not reported here before) lives in the most elevated, landward, terrestrial parts of marshes and thus defines the uppermost limit of the influence of marine water. However, the marshes are generally dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca at the landward and seaward sides, respectively. Judammina macrescens is observed living epiphytically on decaying Carex leaf debris. The most widely distributed euryhaline species are Elphidium williamsoni, Miliammina fusca, Ammonia beccarii, and Haynesina germanica.

An assessment of free dissolved sulfide (Sigma S-II) concentration and pH in pore water and metals (Fe and Hg), fine grained (<63 mu m) and organic carbon (OC) contents in sediment allowed us to conclude that mercury distribution in SA is chiefly controlled by <63 mu m sediments and metal sulfide formation. Furthermore, redox conditions were relatively stable during both sampling periods. Nevertheless, bioturbation promotes oxygen penetration and subsequent acidification of pore water associated with upper sediment layers in SM, especially during the brackish water period. Most likely, such oxidizing conditions hamper sulfate reduction and, thereafter, Hg immobilization via the formation of metal sulfides.

However, few programs have addressed the functional ecological equivalence of man-made marshes and their natural counterparts. This study addresses structural and functional interactions in a man-made and two natural marshes. This was done by integrating substrate characteristics and marsh utilization by organisms of two trophic levels. Sediment properties, infaunal community composition, and Fundulus heteroclitus marsh utilization were compared for a man-made Spartina salt marsh (between ages 1 to 3 yr) in Dills Creek, North Carolina, and adjacent natural marshes to the east and west. East natural marsh and planted marsh sediment grain-size distributions were more similar to each other than to the west natural marsh due to shared drainage systems, but sediment organic content of the planted marsh was much lower than in either natural marsh. This difference was reflected in macrofaunal composition. Natural marsh sediments were inhabited primarily by subsurface, deposit-feeding oligochaetes whereas planted marsh sediments were dominated by the tube-building, surface-deposit feeding polychaetes Streblospio benedicti and Manayunkia aestuarina. Infaunal differences were mirrored in Fundulus diets. Natural marsh diets contained more detritus and insects because oligochaetes, though abundant, were relatively inaccessible. Polychaetes and algae were major constituents of the planted marsh Fundulus diet. Though natural-marsh fish may acquire a potentially less nutritive, detritus-based diet relative to the higher animal protein diet of the planted marsh fish, Fundulus abundances were markedly lower in the planted marsh than in the natural marshes, indicating fewer fish were being supported. Lower Spartina stem densities in the planted marsh may have provided inadequate protection from predation or insufficient spawning sites for the fundulids. After three years, the planted marsh remained functionally distinct from the adjacent natural marshes. Mitigation success at Dills Creek could have been improved by increasing tidal flushing, thereby enhancing access to marine organisms and by mulching with Spartina wrack to increase sediment organic-matter content and porosity. Results from this study indicate that salt marshes should not be treated as a replaceable resource in the short term. The extreme spatial and temporal variability inherent to salt marshes make it virtually impossible to exactly replace a marsh by planting one on another site.","10.2307/1351977","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026077003&doi=10.2307%2f1351977&partnerID=40&md5=058efaf904f10a5f88db731df0fe3162"

Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora. Conclusion The S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased SOC and TN contents and reduced the abundance of sulfur-oxidizing functional genes, which led to the accumulation of soil sulfide.","10.1007/s11104-021-05154-x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332055",NA

In the upper 10 km of the oligohaline zones, C:N ratios of sediment are characteristic of particulate terrestrial plant material ( > 15). The delta-C-13 values increase linearly with distance from freshwater tributaries to the mouths of the estuaries (approximately 20-parts per thousand salinity), > 40 km from the ocean. Observed gradients in isotopic and C:N ratios imply that conservative mixing of freshwater and marine OC occurs. Phytoplankton in the estuaries produce at least 10 times more particulate OC than is delivered in runoff, however, and its biomass is recycled at rates much faster than those of water exchange. The observed gradients are therefore largely attributed to recycling of a resident pool of estuarine C, atmospheric CO2, and an increasing marine bicarbonate fraction from the salt wedge downriver. Essentially lentic conditions in these estuaries ensure the dominance of in situ biological processes.","10.4319/lo.1990.35.6.1290","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332069",NA

Permit requests for piers have recently increased in the U.S. leading to concern by environmental regulatory agencies on potential impacts. In response, a project was conducted in Maryland to assess the impacts of long piers on plant communities, soils, and marsh surface characteristics. Twenty sites with piers and 20 control sites were assessed. Control sites and pier sites were similar with respect to soil types, marsh surface characteristics, and plant community composition. Shading consistently reduced vegetation density directly beneath piers and occasionally reduced vegetation density adjacent to piers. Shading favored Spartina alterniflora over Distichlis spicata, and Distichlis spicata over Spartina patens. Distribution of marsh surface components (high marsh, low marsh, mudflats, open water) was unaffected by proximity to piers. Direct evidence of pier effects on erosion or deposition was limited to the immediate vicinity of a few piers. In general, thickness of the organic horizons or that of the root mats was unaffected by proximity to a pier.

However, this temporal information is often difficult to interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C-14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C-14 age spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C-14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C-14 ages within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C-14 ages from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C-14 ages from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<<300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C-14 age of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C-14 ages also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise.","10.1002/2016GC006526","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332088","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010685610&doi=10.1002%2f2016GC006526&partnerID=40&md5=9a08e365e8bc57c0f2cd3d83a393a566"

Our results demonstrated that the changing trend of inorganic sulfur (IS) and total sulfur (TS) contents were consistent. TS and IS contents in SEW and SHW soils showed a decrease and then an increase in the whole sampling dates. TS and IS showed significant differences between the TFW and SEW soils (p < 0.05). Water-soluble sulfate (H2O-S) contents exhibited a ""decreasing then increasing"" trend after the regulation (from July to October) in the SHW (7.86-19.23 mg/kg) and SEW (8.12-16.27 mg/kg) soils, whereas the TFW (21.35-30.58 mg/kg) soils showed an opposite trend after the regulation. The dynamic variations in absorbed sulfate (Absorbed-S) in the SHW (1.52-2.64 mg/kg), SEW (1.27-1.93 mg/kg) and TFW (2.06-2.89 mg/kg) soils before and after the regulation were consistent with H2O-S. Hydrochloric acid-soluble sulfur (HCl-S) contents in the SEW (4.13-6.72 mg/kg) soils showed a ""double V"" tendency before and after the regulation. In the SHW (4.51-7.26 mg/kg) soils, HCl-S contents showed an increasing trend before the regulation and a ""decreasing then increasing"" trend after the regulation. Sulfide sulfur (Sulfide-S) contents increased significantly after the regulation in SHW, SEW and TFW soils. Compared to the SHWsoils, C-O-S showed a similar dynamic trend in the SEW and TFW soils. Dynamic variations in CeS contents in SHW, SEW and TFW soils were similar to that of TS. On the whole, the average contents of TS, IS and OS in the three flooding wetlands followed the order: TFW > SHW > SEW during the sampling period. Sulfur forms in the three wetlands followed the order: C-S > C-O-S > H2O-S > HCl-S > Absorbed-S > SulfideS. Compared with C-O-S, C-S was significantly correlated with TN and clay, explaining the prevalence of C-S over C-O-S in wetland soils in the Yellow River Delta.

Thus, stable carbon isotope values can provide valuable evidence of sea level fluctuations in these regions. Values of delta(13)C which depart from the predictive model could be caused by diagenetic processes (decomposition) and/or contribution from carbon sources not accounted for in the model.

The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.","10.1007/s11368-018-2177-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332125",NA

Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab76da","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332126","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082665177&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fab76da&partnerID=40&md5=4689963860f62d688a0eace0d72c943e"

We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2-16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most-but not all-living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades.

We conducted poisoned and non-poisoned incubations of leaf material from four different perennial wetland plants (Eleocharis spp., Cladium jamaicense, Rhizophora mangle and Spartina alterniflora) collected from different oligotrophic freshwater and estuarine wetland settings. Total phosphorus (TP) release from the P-limited Everglades plant species (Eleocharis spp., C. jamaicense and R. mangle) was much lower than TP release by the salt marsh plant S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet (SC). For most species and sampling times, total organic carbon (TOC) and TP leaching losses were much greater in poisoned than non-poisoned treatments, likely as a result of epiphytic microbial activity. Therefore, a substantial portion of the C and P leached from these wetland plant species was bio-available to microbial communities. Even the microbes associated with S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet showed indications of P-limitation early in the leaching process, as P was removed from the water column. Leaves of R. mangle released much more TOC per gram of litter than the other species, likely contributing to the greater waterborne [DOC] observed by others in the mangrove ecotone of Everglades National Park. Between the two freshwater Everglades plants, C. jamaicense leached nearly twice as much P than Eleocharis spp. In scaling this to the landscape level, our observed leaching losses combined with higher litter production of C. jamaicense compared to Eleocharis spp. resulted in a substantially greater P leaching from plant litter to the water column and epiphytic microbes. In conclusion, leaching of fresh plant litter can be an important autochthonous source of nutrients in freshwater and estuarine wetland ecosystems.","10.1007/s10750-006-0124-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332137","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33746768711&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-006-0124-1&partnerID=40&md5=e6f94493eb3a0439ccb59487b37bd385"

The foraminifera Ammonia tepida and some miliolids (Quinqueloculina and Varidentella) inhabit most estuaries during summer when salinities of 13-18 psu and temperatures of 26-34 degrees C occur. At the Naaman stream the agglutinated species Birsteiniolla macrostoma and Trichohyalus aguayoi dominate the assemblage during autumn and winter, respectively when salinities of 3-7 psu and temperature of 18-24 degrees C prevail. High abundance of the monospecific assemblage of the ostracod Cyprideis torosa was encountered at the Tanninim year round in oligohaline water. The gastropod Heleobia phaeniciaca prefers living at the Naaman and Tanninim streams while Pyrgophorus sp., an invasive and low salinity species, continue colonizing more stream reaches along the Israeli coast.The dead assemblages are composed of high numbers of local and transported species. It includes post storm surge sediments containing high numbers of inland fresh and brackish water species transported by the floods. Those are mixed with inner to mid-shelf benthic and planktonic foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs. Transportation of the marine organisms a few hundred of meters inland via the estuaries indicates that the coastal areas are prone to storm surge events that are preserved clearly on the coast. The present study demonstrates that the combined use of different multi-proxy faunal records enhances significantly the understanding of the dynamics of low-tide estuaries. This can be applied also to other low-tide estuaries worldwide and facilitate better management of these threatened environments. Additionally, it enables understanding of the post-mortem processes that control the transition from the living to the death assemblages and by that improve paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the lower reaches of low-tide estuaries.

The study was carried out in the Fina-Laterre Marsh Management Area and the Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in managed and unmanaged areas. Water and material flux was measured each two hours during twelve 48 h flux studies, and net fluxes per m(2) of drainage area were calculated for water, total suspended sediments, salinity, NO3+NO2, PO4, and NH4. Short-term sedimentation was measured as the weight of material deposited over 2-4 week intervals on petri dishes placed on the marsh surface. The managed sites experienced considerable reductions in total water exchange, leading to reductions in net material exchanges. when expressed on a per m(2) basis, the managed wetlands are much less tightly coupled to the surrounding estuary compared to unmanaged areas. Within the context of a general decrease of exchange, the two managed areas on average export materials to the estuary. In the managed areas, the results suggest that management can lead to reduced salinity and a loss of sediments and nutrients. Short-term sedimentation was less at the managed areas; expressed as g m(-2)d(-1), total sedimentation rates were 0.57 for Fina managed, 1.02 for Fina unmanaged, 1.68 for Rockefeller managed, and 3.82 for Rockefeller unmanaged. Soil P was lower and soil organic matter was higher at the managed areas. Organic matter in the soil was low compared with recently deposited material, suggesting that most organic matter deposited on the surface of the marsh is lost through decomposition. Reduction of flooding during storm events is the likely mechanism leading to reduced sedimentation on the marsh surface in the managed areas.","10.1007/BF03160631","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332145","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028313408&doi=10.1007%2fBF03160631&partnerID=40&md5=34c6924eec4d8c29685191a050e0582e"

The predominant sulfate-reducing bacteria were more numerous in the concretions than in host sediments, but varied greatly within the concretions. The biomarker i17:1 omega 7c for Desulfovibrio was enriched within the concretions, suggesting that these bacteria, which are capable of reducing iron directly, played an important role in concretion formation.

In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition. These changes were driven primarily by variations in soil nutrient substrates and physiochemical properties. Changes in soil microbial communities following coastal reclamation impacted the decomposition and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, with potential modification of carbon and nitrogen sinks in the ecosystems, with potential feedbacks in response to climate change.","10.1038/s41598-021-86758-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332149",NA

Although exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to the mangrove wetlands (including the associated unvegetated shoals) of China, its effects on the macrobenthic fauna in such wetlands is poorly understood. The macrobenthic faunal communities were compared in (1) an Avicennia marina monoculture vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded A. marina stand (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and in (2) an unvegetated shoal vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded shoal that had rapidly become an S. alterniflora monoculture in Zhanjiang, China. S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased plant density regardless of invaded habitat but significantly increased the contents of total carbon, organic matter, and total sulfur in the sediment only in the unvegetated shoal. The presence of S. alterniflora had little influence on indices of the macrobenthic faunal community in the A. marina monoculture, but significantly decreased the density and biomass of macrobenthic faunal community in the unvegetated shoal. These results indicate that the effects of S. alterniflora on the macrobenthic faunal community depend on which type of mangrove habitat is invaded. The composition of the macrobenthic faunal community was more similar between the invaded and non-invaded A. marina stand than between the invaded and non-invaded unvegetated shoal. Overall, the differences in the macrobenthic faunal community between invaded and non-invaded habitats were associated with increases in the sediment organic matter content and plant density.","10.1007/s11284-018-1624-y","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332153",NA

To investigate how geomorphic changes may have altered the Grand Bay estuary, sediment push cores were collected for foraminiferal, sedimentological (organic matter content, grain-size distribution), and radiochemical (Pb-210,Cs-137, and Be-7) analyses. Clay normalized geochronologies were determined with a constant rate of supply model. Based on downcore age-depth relationships, select intervals were analyzed for foraminifera in order to assess alterations in the microfossil assemblage in Grand Bay estuary over the 20th Century. All estuarine samples were low diversity (species richness: 1-10; Fisher's alpha diversity: 0.14-1.75); two species, Ammotium salsum and Paratrochammina simplissima, dominated all downcore assemblages. Paratrochammina simplissima increased in abundance up-core from a minor subsidiary species (median = 4.7% at 19-20 cm) to dominant or co-dominant with A. salsum over the 20th and early 21st Centuries in six cores, comprising up to 60.7% of a single sample. The emerging dominance of P. simplissima since similar to 1950 along with the reduction of brackish-estuarine taxa and introduction of calcareous species signifies increased salinity and less marsh organic matter preserved in the sediments. While seasonal dissolution limits our ability to chronologically constrain the introduction of calcareous species, P. simplissima, a species not referenced in taxonomic data from the northern Gulf of Mexico until 2012, is well constrained, following its first occurrence in the 1930s.","10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107312","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332155",NA

Samples were obtained in five locations and sediment characterised for grain size, total organic matter, total-recoverable metals (Al, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn and Mn), as well as acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM). In situ effects were evaluated by examining the macrobenthic community structure. An elutriate sediment toxicity test (ESTT) was used to estimate the amount of metals and nutrients that could be exchanged with the water column through resuspension, and its positive or negative effects on the growth of the micro-alga Emiliania huxleyi in a 10 day test. Anthropogenic metal contamination was identified at the north bank of the Douro estuary, with deleterious effects on the macrobenthic community, namely decrease in number of species and diversity. This contamination could possibly also be toxic for water column organisms, in case of resuspension, as shown by the ESTT. Sediments from the salt marsh at the south bank showed an impoverished macrobenthic community and elutriate toxicity, which appeared to be due to anaerobic conditions.

First, the characteristics of their distribution were investigated followed by their monitoring for 4 years focusing on the habitats in the lagoon. Also, their life traits were compared including production of hibernacles, fruits, and seeds by the soil fertilization and light intensities. Next, the information on the species was secured by germination experiment using the generated seeds from the cultivation experiment. The habitat of Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald in Korea was located in the rear edge of the worldwide distribution and its four habitats were isolated and distributed far away each other. Two of them were located in small salt-marsh and fine sand estuaries formed in the rocky area of the seashore, and the other two were inhabited with the sandy soil in the lagoon which was connected by river-mouth to the sea. Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald tends to be distributed in the sites where the establishment and growth of the competitor were inhibited by salinity, periodic flooding, and lower layer of the soil to extend a roots. It maintained its population by recruitments of hibernacles and seedling. The production of hibernacle was assumed to be affected by the particle consist of the sand together with organic matters in the soil. Seedling recruitment was observed only in the salt-marsh area located in the rear sites of sand ridge where was the shore of the lagoon. Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald was observed to have different threatening factors by each population. Its population in Pohang seemed the sedimentation of fine sand which affected the recruitment of hibernacles had been eroded due to the construction of the coastal road. The population in Ulsan appeared rapid expansion of competitor and reduction of its distribution area due to the interruption of eluted water supplied to the habitat. On the other hand, the habitat in the lagoon maintained the population relatively stable. Especially, the population in Songji-ho was determined to be the most stable one. To sustain the population of Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald distributed in the lagoon, it is suggested that the wide ranged scale of conservational activities is necessary to maintain the mechanisms including the entrance of seawater which belongs to the lagoon, and periodic flooding.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332157",NA

Several locations along the estuary salinity gradient were sampled during four different periods of contrasting river discharge and tidal ranee. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters ranged from 7 mg l(-1) in the lower bay stations closest to the ocean to 20 mg l(-1) in the river and upper bay samples. There was a general linear relationship between DOC concentrations and salinity in three of the four sampling periods. In contrast, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were significantly lower (0.1-3 mg l(-1)) and showed no relationship with salinity. The high molecular weight dissolved OM (HMW DOM) isolated from selected water samples collected along the bay displayed atomic carbon: nitrogen ratios ([C/N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic carbon (delta(13)C(OC)) that ranged from 10 to 30 and from -28 to -25parts per thousand, respectively. Combined, such compositions indicate that in most HMW DOM samples, the majority of the OM originates from terrigenous sources, with smaller contributions from riverine and estuarine phytoplankton. In contrast, the [C/N]a ratios of particulate OM (POM) samples varied significantly among the collection periods, ranging from low values of similar to5 to high values of >20. Overall, the trends in [C/N]a ratios indicated that algal sources of POM were most important during the early and late summer, whereas terrigenous sources dominated in the winter and early spring.In Winyah Bay bottom sediments, the concentrations of the mineral-associated OM were positively correlated with sediment surface area. The [C/N]a ratios and delta(13)C(OC) compositions of the bulk sedimentary OM ranged from 5 to 45 and from -28 to -23parts per thousand, respectively. These compositions were consistent with predominant contributions of terrigenous sources and lesser (but significant) inputs of freshwater, estuarine and marine phytoplankton. The highest terrigenous contents were found in sediments from the river and upper bay sites, with smaller contributions to the lower parts of the estuary. The yields of lignin-derived CuO oxidation products from Winyah Bay sediments indicated that the terrigenous OM in these samples was composed of variable mixtures of relatively fresh vascular plant detritus and moderately altered soil OM. Based on the lignin phenol compositions, most of this material appeared to be derived from angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular plant sources similar to those found in the upland coastal forests in this region. A few samples displayed lignin compositions that suggested a more significant contribution from marsh C-3 grasses. However, there was no evidence of inputs of Spartina alterniflora (a C-4 grass) remains from the salt marshes that surround the lower sections of Winyah Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface sediment samples were collected along the estuarine gradient and analyzed for diatoms, organic matter, water content and grain size. Water salinity, pH, turbidity and temperature were measured seasonally at every sampling site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied in order to recognize which environmental variables correlated most closely with the distributions of diatom taxa. Salinity and sediment properties were identified as the most important variables influencing diatom distribution in the studied estuaries. A two-component Weighted-Averaging Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) calibration model was developed to infer salinity based on diatom assemblages. The reliability of the model was evaluated by the error of prediction (RMSEPj(ack-knifed) = 4.42 parts per thousand) and the correlation (r(jack-knifed)(2) = 0.75) between observed and diatom-inferred values. The transfer function was applied to fossil diatom assemblages recovered from a Holocene sequence from the Argentinean coast.

However, less is known about the influence of ecosystem size on environmental characteristics; for example, do larger ecosystems have higher nutrient availability? The nature of this relationship is important for gaining a better understanding of whether the effects of ecosystem size on community functioning are direct or indirect. Indirect effects may exist when the environmental characteristics of larger ecosystems are different from those of smaller ones, and thus the different functioning of communities observed along the ecosystem-size gradient may respond to, for instance, different levels of nutrient availability, and not uniquely to different ecosystem sizes. Here, we tested whether the environmental characteristics (i.e., the physical, chemical and biological characteristics) of temporary ponds of various sizes differed. We chose temporary ponds because they are abiotic controlled systems in which abiotic factors have a strong influence on aquatic communities. However, temporary ponds are usually spatially clustered; consequently, pond locality might also be important in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond (i.e., ponds close to one another may share similar features). We therefore examined whether pond locality is a more important factor than size in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond. To do so, we sampled environmental characteristics (chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, macrophyte biomass, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and total organic and inorganic carbon) of ponds in 5 different localities. A cluster of ponds (10 to 12) was sampled in each locality. Ponds encompassing a wide range of sizes were selected for sampling within each locality. We also performed a meta-analysis (including data from 27 temporary pond localities) to investigate whether the environmental characteristics of the ponds sampled in this study were representative of Mediterranean temporary ponds, and thus if such characteristics could be used to distinguish between Mediterranean temporary ponds from temporary ponds located outside of the Mediterranean region. Our results showed that locality had a strong effect on the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds, whereas size had only a weak influence; only chlorophyll-a and pond depth showed a robust relationship with size, as both increased with pond size independently of locality. Moreover, our results suggest that the typology of the temporary pond (i.e., if they were mountain temporary ponds, salt marsh ponds or lowland ponds) had a larger influence on several environmental characteristics than did regional location (i.e., Mediterranean).",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332182",NA

We have investigated the relationships between stocks of different soil organic carbon (SOC) along the soil vertical profile and invasive plant success in a China wetland. In stands dominated by the exotic invasive species Spartina alterniflora and the native invasive Phragmites australis soil organic-carbon concentrations (SOC) were higher (12% and 9%, respectively) than in plots of a native species, Cyperus malaccensis, whereas SOC content (g m(-2) ) was 18% and 17% lower under P. australis than under S. alterniffolia and C. malaccensis, respectively. Soils under both invasive species had the concentrations and contents of light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC), light-fraction organic nitrogen (LFON) at 30-60 cm of soil depth and labile organic carbon (LOC) concentrations at 0-10 cm higher than soils under native species. The invasive species had higher total aboveground, total biomasses and lower shoot:root ratios than the native species. The success of both invasive species was associated with higher growth rates and accumulation of nutrients in biomass than in the native species and also accumulation of C in plant soil system. The stands currently dominated by the invasive species were recently occupied by monospecific stands of the native C. malaccensis, strongly suggesting that all or most of the current soil differences were due to the invasions. Higher sand fraction in C. malaccensis community and higher clay fraction in P. australis community relative to the native species, were correlated with higher soil N and P concentrations in invaded stands. The results suggest that different vegetation cover with distinct shoot/root ratio can change soil structure by favoring sedimentation of different particle size classes. Thus, despite both invasive species have some common traits, the results also showed that different invasive species with partially distinct impacts on soil and nutrient uses can succeed under the same conditions. The traits conferring invasive success are thus not necessarily species-specific.

P forms and phosphatase activities varied greatly from site to site even under the same vegetation cover. NH4Cl-P, bicarbonate/dithionite extracted P and NaOH-P were remarkably higher (p < 0.05) in soils With exotic invasive plants, Spartina alterniflora, than in soils with the native species Suaeda salsa, Scirpus mango etc and Phragmites australis. HCl-P and refractory P showed little variation. No significant differences were detected for either alkaline phosphatase (ALAP) or acid phosphatase (ACAP) among the soils. All of the above properties were much higher in soils with plant growth compared to bare flat soils. Regression analysis demonstrated that organic matter (OM), Al, Ca, Fe and total P (TP) were able to explain more than 70% of the variations in the P fractions (except 29% of NH4Cl-P), and OM was the most important contributing factor. ALAP and ACAP were irrelevant to P but were significantly related to TOC, suggesting that carbon was a limiting factor for P mineralization in this area. Owing to its huge biomass and densities, Spartina alterniflora displayed great potential for carbon input, thus facilitating P mineralization and cycling. The results enhance our understanding of P availability differences in this area covered by invasive and native vegetation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries. When dating is not provided by classic radiometric methods, historical pictures (< 100 years) may constitute a valuable alternative method to reconstruct recent environments.","10.1016/j.marmicro.2018.05.003","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332221","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048817154&doi=10.1016%2fj.marmicro.2018.05.003&partnerID=40&md5=b983d6fb5e7bca9ca440c44e4e4696f8"

This breach was subsequently filled with sediments dredged from the adjacent sound. The purpose of this study was to determine if the barrier island terrestrial plant communities were naturally re-establishing through primary succession. In 2006-2008, we compared plant communities, soil carbon and nitrogen, and Aeolian transport of sediments in undisturbed back-dunes, undisturbed shrub thickets, putative back-dunes, and putative shrub thickets. We found that species richness and evenness were low on the filled area relative to adjacent plant communities that had persisted through the storm. Plants on the filled area were almost entirely limited to a band of primarily Spartina patens found at the margin of the sound and there were no signs of establishing the typical zonation of back dune grasses, shrubs, and salt marsh. Evaluation of soil quality suggests that nutrients and organic material are not limiting recovery. Aeolian transport, however, was demonstrably higher across the filled area, where no dense stands of taller plants buffered the airflow. Plant re-establishment is suppressed by wind erosion inhibiting deposition of seeds. Recovery of the site will likely depend on the rhizomatous spread of S. patens from the sound shore. S. patens can then potentially facilitate the colonization of other species by buffering the wind and trapping seeds of other plants. Ironically, this slow recovery may benefit federally threatened bird species that require sparse vegetation for nesting success.","10.1007/s11852-013-0249-0","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332224","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883867212&doi=10.1007%2fs11852-013-0249-0&partnerID=40&md5=5c1d8e1a47cc1ec704f5cd624dc44dea"

Coastal wetlands with different plant cover types (including bare land, Phragmites australis, and Suaeda salsa wetlands) and groundwater table wetlands (including low groundwater table, medium groundwater table, and high groundwater table wetlands) were investigated in 2012-2013 to characterize the spatial and temporal changes and the effects of groundwater tables on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The results showed that SOCs in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 regardless of the groundwater tables, while TNs was higher in 2013 than in 2012 except in the BL soil with low groundwater tables and the PA wetlands with middle groundwater tables. The SOCc and TNc were mainly concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. SOC. and TNc were fitted very well with soil depth by the general linear fit (p < 0.01). The Lorentz models were ideal for the relationships among SOC, TN and electrical conductivity (EC), indicating that certain EC values could improve carbon and nitrogen accumulation. The theoretical threshold of EC for the maximum SOC and SOCs was 2.2 ms/cm, and the maximum TN and TNs highly depended on groundwater tables (0.9-1.0 ms/cm for LW, 1.6-1.8 ms/cm for MW and 3.0 ms/cm for HW). The general linear model results showed that SOC was positively correlated with TN at the same groundwater table (p < 0.01). Additionally, a positive linear relationship was also observed among SOC, TN and silt + clay contents for all groundwater tables (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that carbon and nitrogen stocks might be regulated by groundwater tables and salinity to improve carbon sinks in coastal wetlands.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106969","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332225",NA

Sulfur concentrations in the soil sediments were compared among wetlands dominated by the exotic Spartina alterniflora, the co-occurring native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. The results show that the soil sulfur concentrations in the Spartina alterniflora community showed significant spatiotemporal variability with the years since invasion. The S. alterniflora community contained the highest concentrations of sulfur in the soil sediment. Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths. In addition, the soil sulfur concentrations associated with S. alterniflora also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with depth, the soil sulfur concentrations in S. alterniflora soils were obviously higher than those in the S. mariqueter community and unvegetated mudflat, the maximum concentrations in S. alterniflora soils occurred at the depth of 40-60 cm. The findings of this study indicate that S. alterniflora increases wetland sulfur storage, which may explain the mechanism of expansion of S. alterniflora in the Jiuduansha Wetland.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.04.014","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332234",NA

Field observations of soil H-2 uptake are limited, and here we present the results from a series of measurements in forest, desert, and marsh ecosystems in southern California. We measured soil H-2 fluxes using flux chambers from September 2004 to July 2005. Mean H-2 flux rates and standard deviations were -7.9 + -4.2, -7.6 + -5.3 and -7.5 + -3.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for the forest, desert, and marsh, respectively ( corresponding to deposition velocities of 0.063 + -0.029, 0.051 + -0.036, 0.035 + -0.013 cm s(-1)). Soil profile measurements showed that H-2 mixing ratios were between 3% and 51% of atmospheric levels at 10 cm and that the penetration of H-2 into deeper soil layers increased with soil drying. Soil removal experiments in the forest demonstrated that the litter layer did not actively consume H-2, the removal of this layer increased uptake by deeper soil layers, and the exposure of subsurface soil layers to ambient atmospheric H-2 levels substantially increased their rate of uptake. Similar soil removal experiments at the desert site showed that extremely dry surface soils did not consume H-2 and that fluxes at the surface increased when these inactive layers were removed. We present a model of soil H-2 fluxes and show that the diffusivity of soils, along with the vertical distribution of layers that actively consume H-2 regulate surface fluxes. We found that soil organic matter, CO2 fluxes, and ecosystem type were not strong controllers of H-2 uptake. Our experiments highlight H-2 diffusion into soils as an important limit on fluxes and that minimum moisture level is needed to initiate microbial uptake.","10.1029/2008JG000701","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332240","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60249102130&doi=10.1029%2f2008JG000701&partnerID=40&md5=bd9833fec0f9bac136ab82e390185de6"

The Cores CB and ZR, collected from the upper middle estuarine environment, showed higher values of finer fractions and total organic carbon as well as metals (except of Ca) than Core ZA, which was sampled from the lower estuarine environment. The concentration of trace metals including Mn and Fe was found to be largely dependent on the proximity to mining areas, with Core ZR and Core CB representing the highest metal concentrations (Mn, Fe, Cr, and Zn). Absence of a significant early diagenetic remobilization might have preserved the metal loadings due to mining and industrial activities in Cores ZR and CB. In Core ZA, all the elements except Cu showed significant enrichment in the upper portion. Enrichment factor computed in all the cores was found to be above 2 for all the studied metals except Zn, which suggests a high degree of metal contamination.

This paper provides a description of the fauna and examines faunal succession in Salicornia-vegetated sediments of southern California. Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) and macrofaunal (animals greater than or equal to 0.3 mm) community structure were examined in sediments of five natural, southern California Salicornia spp. marshes (Tijuana Estuary, San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Anaheim Bay) and in created Salicornia marshes 16 months to 10 years in age, located within four of the bays. Oligochaetes and insects were the dominant taxa in both natural (71 to 98% of total fauna) and created (91 to 97%) marshes. In San Diego, Newport and Anaheim Bays, macrofaunal densities were generally higher in the created marshes (88 000 to 290 000 ind m(-2)) than in their natural counterparts (26 000 to 50 000 ind m(-2)). In the youngest system, Mission Bay, the reverse was true (natural: 113 000 vs created: 28 000 ind m-2). Similar species numbers were recorded from the created and adjacent natural marshes. Insects, especially chironomids, dolichopodids, and heleids, as well as the naidid oligochaete, Paranais litoralis, characterize early successional stages. Enchytraeid and tubificid oligochaetes reflect later succession evident in natural and older created marshes. Sediment organic matter (both combustible and below-ground plant biomass) was the environmental variable most commonly associated with densities of various macrofaunal taxa. These relationships were generally negative in the natural marshes and positive in the created marshes. Within-bay comparisons of macrofauna from natural Salicornia- vs Spartina-vegetated habitat in San Diego and Mission Bays revealed lower macrofaunal density (San Diego Bay only), proportionally fewer oligochaetes and more insects, and no differences in species richness in the Salicornia habitat. The oldest created Salicornia marsh (San Diego Bay) exhibited an assemblage intermediate in composition between those of the natural Salicornia- and Spartina-vegetated marshes. These results suggest: (a) faunal recovery following Salicornia marsh creation can require 10 or more years, (b) high macrofaunal variability among bays requires marsh creation reference site selection from within the same bay, and (c) Spartina-based research should not be used for Salicornia marsh management decisions.

Fourteen sediment cores were collected along a transect extending 1230 m inland from the Gulf coast. Storm-surge-deposited sediment beds were identified by texture, organic content, carbonate content, the presence of marine microfossils and Cs-137 dating. The hurricane-derived sediment beds facilitate assessment of changes in marsh sedimentation from nearshore to inland locations and over decadal to annual timescales. Spatial variation along the transect reflects varying contributions"" from three prevailing sediment sources: flooding, overwash and organic sedimentation from marsh plants. Over about the last decade, hurricane overwash has been the predominant sediment source for nearshore locations because of large sediment inputs from Hurricanes Rita and Ike. Farther inland, hurricane inputs diminish and sedimentation is dominated by deposition from flood waters and a larger organic component. Temporal variations in sedimentation reflect hurricane activity, changes in marsh surface elevation and degree of compaction of marsh sediments, which is time-dependent. There was little to no marsh sedimentation in the period 2008-2014, firstly because no hurricanes impacted the study area and secondly because overwash sedimentation prior to 2008 had increased nearshore marsh surface elevations by up to 0.68 m, reducing subsequent inputs from flooding. Marsh sedimentation rates were relatively high in the period 2005-2008, averaging 2.13 cm/year and possibly reflecting sediment contributions from Hurricanes Humberto and Gustay. However, these marsh sediments are highly organic and largely uncompacted. Older, deeper marsh deposits formed between 1961 and 2005 are less organic rich, more compacted and have an average annual sedimentation rate of 0.38 cm/year, which is closely comparable to long-term sedimentation rates in similar marsh settings nearby. These results demonstrate the utility of using hurricane storm surge marker beds to investigate marsh sedimentation, provide insights into the sedimentary response of coastal marshes to hurricanes and provide useful guidance to public policy aimed at combating the effects of sea-level rise on coastal marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico.

Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic matter in the top 5 cm of sediment was 475 g C m(-2) lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1). It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates that the increase in soil respiration was largely due to an increase in primary production. Sediment respiration in laboratory incubations also demonstrated positive effects of nutrients. Thus, the results indicate that increased nutrient loading of oligotrophic wetlands can lead to an increased rate of sediment carbon turnover and a net loss of carbon from sediments.","10.4319/lo.1999.44.3.0699","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332266","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032937950&doi=10.4319%2flo.1999.44.3.0699&partnerID=40&md5=7da44c28189c5eaf785bbb95814aa06d"

The global morphological and chemical preservation of the organic matter attested by various sedimentary parameters, including the proportions of cellulose-bearing tissues, the TOC contents, the C/N ratios, the total sulphur contents and the delta(13)C compositions, reveals that the sedimentary organic matter is less degraded when it has been under the influence of the marine water table for a long time. This is indicated by a good correlation between the salinities of interstitial waters, the redox potentials measured in the wet sediments and the chemical composition of the organic matter.

The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of plant invasion on the soil microbial community in a coastal wetland of eastern China.We investigated the impact of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on the soil microbial community structure based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis and chloroform fumigation-extraction by comparing it to that of bare flat and native C-3 plants Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities.Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil microbial biomass C and the total and various types of PLFAs compared with bare flat, Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Increased concentrations of soil moisture, electrical conductivity, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total, labile and recalcitrant soil organic C and N, and decreased soil pH in Spartina alterniflora community explained 65.9 % of the total variability in the PLFAs. WSOC and soil labile organic N were strongly correlated with PLFAs, whereas soil pH was negatively related to PLFAs.A 10-year Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil microbial biomass and community structure by increasing available substrate.

This technique allows the detection of both direct and indirect relationships among AVS, SEM, and other soil variables, representing results in a graphical view. The dataset included 90 soil samples from 21 different sites belonging to 6 different saltmarshes and featured a wide range of soil chemicophysical properties. Variables included in the a priori model were hydroperiod, pH, soil redox potential, labile organic carbon, carbonates, total iron, and total amount of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The best optimized model pointed out the main soil properties that affect AVS accumulation and SEM speciation in these soils. Effect plots of AVS and SEM calculated with the partial linear mixed-effects models included in the piecewise structural equation modeling showed a significant and positive influence of pH and carbonates on AVS and a highly significant effect of carbonates and labile organic carbon on SEM. Single SEM components were also considered separately, to define the potential contributions of labile organic carbon or carbonates as alternative binding phases. Simultaneously extracted Cu, Ni, and Zn were preferentially bound to carbonates, followed by labile organic carbon, whereas Pb and Cd were easily bound to labile organic carbon.

Aboveground biomass was greater in the Phragmites and S. alterniflora marshes (706-809 g/m2) as compared to the S. patens/I. frutescens and impounded marshes (378-588 g/m2). Macro-organic matter (0-30 cm) was similar across all marshes (7452-9212 g/m2). The S. patens/Iva frutescens marsh had the lowest aboveground biomass, but contained more plant species (2.8 species/0.25 m2) and greater species diversity (H=1.33) than the other marshes (1.3-2.0 species/0.25 m2, H=0.16-0.78).

Concentration of branched (br) GDGTs ranged from < 1 to 15 mu g/g organic carbon (OC) and crenarchaeol ranged from 0.6 to 19 mu g/g OC. An overall decrease in brGDGTs was observed from the inner Thames (Brentford) to the outer Thames (Isle of Grain), suggesting a drop in soil OM input towards the sea. In contrast, crenarchaeol concentration was highest around east London rather than towards the open sea. Such elevated crenarchaeol concentration occurred in the section of the river most influenced by anthropogenic pollution, such as discharge points for London's major sewage treatment plants, docks and power plants. The non-systematic spatial distribution of crenarchaeol was also reflected in the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The highest BIT values occurred upstream and in close proximity to salt marshes (0.8-1), whereas the lowest values (0.3-0.5) were towards the sea. However, unusually low values (0.4) were observed in the river section that had high crenarchaeol concentration. In contrast, bulk delta C-13 values were insensitive to London's anthropogenic influence. This suggests that the natural systematic decrease in BIT index in the estuary is overprinted by London's anthropogenic activity between Deptford Creek and Tilbury. We therefore advise caution when interpreting the BIT index for sediments in close proximity to megacities discharging industrial and municipal waste that can become incorporated into the near surface sedimentary record.

Short-term sedimentation was measured as sediment accumulation on paper filters which had been placed on the soil surface for several weeks. Total sedimentation and material lost on ignition was significantly related to individual sampling periods, reflecting the importance of short-term processes. High sedimentation at riverine sites (up to 22 g m(-2) d(-1)) was related to a combination of river stage and wind events. Marine and impounded wetlands of the Rhone Delta experienced low sedimentation throughout the period of study. Sedimen tation rates averaged over the study period were 0.8 g m(-2) d(-1), 1.8 g m(-2) d(-1), and 5.4g m(-2) d(-1) for marine, impounded, and riverine sites, respectively. Percent material lost on ignition was low in all habitats (average 15%) and followed a seasonal trend with a minimum in late fall and winter (1%). Soil percent organic matter was also low in the top several centimeters (13%), suggesting that inorganic sedimentation is very important for accretion on these wetland surfaces. Coastal flooding was not a significant mechanism for sedimentation in the marine sites during the period of study. Sedimentation is an important factor in elevation change, and this study shows that impounded habitats, the most common ""natural environment"" left in the delta, may become vulnerable to sea-level rise in the future if management practices continue to isolate these wetlands from riverine sources of sediment.","10.2307/1352546","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332320",NA

The biota will be spatially distributed according to its response to environmental parameters such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon content, grain size, and intensity of currents and tidal flow, whereas the presence of anthropogenic and volcanic constituents will reflect proximity to source areas and whether they are fluvially- or aerially-transported. Because each of these constituents have a unique environmental signature, they are a more precise proxy for that source area than the conventional sedimentary process indicators.This San Francisco Bay Coastal System study demonstrates that by applying a multi-proxy approach, the primary sites of sediment transport can be identified. Many of these sites are far from where the constituents originated, showing that sediment transport is widespread in the region. Although not often used, identifying and interpreting the distribution of naturally-occurring and allochthonous biologic, anthropogenic, and volcanic sediment constituents is a powerful tool to aid in the investigation of sediment transport pathways in other coastal systems.

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105275","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332324","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103244945&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105275&partnerID=40&md5=b9dd6a3562f60f8b6afc9b4eeb48c8e5"

Monthly samples were collected during the period from February 1998 to February 1999 in both parts of the lagoon. Ventrosia maritima displayed an annual life cycle. Recruitment occurred in summer and autumn at the outer part of the lagoon and additionally in late winter at the innermost part. A positive correlation was found between the percentages of small individuals and salinity or sediment organic matter at the outer part. Growth practically ceased in winter. The mudsnail displayed remarkable densities and an increase in growth in spring at < 1 psu indicating that it is highly tolerant to extremely low salinities. Population density showed a significant seasonal variation; it increased from early summer to autumn (30,000-40,000 individuals m(-2)) following the summer and autumn recruitment. No significant correlation between the density of V. maritima and several examined physicochemical variables was found; a negative correlation was observed between the density of the mudisnail and that of the co-occurring polychaete Streblospio shrubsolii. Secondary production calculated by the size-frequency method gave a mean annual density (N) of 9740 ind m(-2), a mean biomass (B) of 1.66 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m(-2) y(-1), a production (P) of 4.51 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 2.72 at the outer part of the lagoon and a N of 14,570 ind m(-2), a B of 3.2 g AFDW m(-2) y(-1), a P of 9.9 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 3.09 at the innermost part.

Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis. Furthermore, the constructed wetlands accumulated soil RP-C from 2.33 to 0.08 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the constructed wetlands 1 to 30 years old, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Such a morphological investigation of estuarine change following Spartina introduction has not been attempted elsewhere before. A difference was found between marshes in upper and lower estuary. Surface topography of Type-1 marshes of the upper estuary was found to be independent of the pre-Spartina surface morphology, with deeper vertical development and exhibiting a flat to slightly concave upper marsh, a convex ridge in the outer mid marsh, and a relatively steeply graded convex lower marsh. Type-2 marshes of the lower estuary were thinner in vertical development, and with surface topography dictated by the underlying pre-Spartina surface. The difference was found to be due to variations in environmental conditions in sediment supply and wave/current exposure between the two regions rather being an indication of relative maturity. The seaward edge of marshes was found to be 0.5 m lower at the seaward end of the Tamar relative to the landward, reflecting tidal amplification up this confined estuary. While Spartina marshes are accretionary, surveys demonstrated retreat of the seaward margins throughout the estuary over the past 17 years, and the development of erosional scarps in Type-1 marshes. Spatial mapping identified 374 ha of S. anglica infestation within the Tamar Estuary, with Type-1 marshes occupying 240 ha and Type-2 marshes occupying 134 ha. Topographic profiles and stratigraphic data were used to estimate total sediment volumes trapped by Spartina in the Tamar Estuary, finding approximately 1,193,441 m(3) of material to have been trapped beneath Spartina since its introduction in 1947, of which between 14 and 28% has been Spartina-derived organic matter.

The results showed that the average TOC content of the vegetated saltmarsh sediments, bare tidal flat areas near vegetation (BF1), and bare tidal flat areas far from vegetation (BF2) were 4.05, 2.72, and 1.22 mg/g, respectively. The mean delta C-13 value within the vegetated saltmarsh area was -22.37 parts per thousand, and the C/N ratio was 9.3; the corresponding values in the BF1 area were -23.27 parts per thousand and 7.95, respectively; and in the BF2 area, the corresponding values were -21.91 parts per thousand and 5.36, respectively. These C/N ratios reflect an increasing marine contribution with distance from the vegetated zone. Combined with the two-terminal mixing model, the organic carbon in the vegetated saltmarsh sediments was dominated by terrestrial sources, while the bare tidal flat sediments were more influenced by marine sources, and the bare tidal flat sediments nearer to the vegetated zone (BF1) were influenced by a combination of vegetation, marine sources, and other terrestrial factors.","10.3390/jmse9090992","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332388","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115255989&doi=10.3390%2fjmse9090992&partnerID=40&md5=46bc9e8992c08a9d76f70865be91ecd5"

Dimethylselenoniopropionate, a possible precursor of dimethylselenide, is the selenium analogue of the common marine osmoprotectant, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Dimethylselenoniopropionate was organically synthesized from dimethylselenide and acrylate and used in a comparative study with dimethylsulfoniopropionate as a growth substrate, an inducer and substrate for dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in two marine bacterial isolates, Alcaligenes sp. strain M3A and Pseudomonas doudoroffii, and in salt marsh sediments and estuarine creek water samples. In P. doudoroffii, the rate of dimethylselenoniopropionate transport into cells was about half that observed with dimethylsulfoniopropionate; Alcaligenes does not take up these molecules. The rate and extent of induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in P. doudoroffii at low concentrations of dimethylselenoniopropionate were similar to that of dimethylsulfoniopropionate. In Alcaligenes the low constitutive level of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase cleaved dimethylselenoniopropionate into dimethylselenide and acrylate, but induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase by dimethylselenoniopropionate did not follow. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyases from both strains, when induced by dimethylsulfoniopropionate, utilized dimethylselenoniopropionate as a substrate with emission of dimethylselenide. Rates of partially purified dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity with dimethylselenoniopropionate were half those with dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Anoxic salt marsh sediments catalyzed dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylselenoniopropionate degradation at equal rates. In sediments containing high organic matter, both dimethylsulfide and dimethylselenide served as substrates for methanogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that organic selenium molecules can be volatilized by the same biochemical pathways as organic sulfur molecules.","10.1016/S0168-6496(97)00039-1","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332406","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030746270&doi=10.1016%2fS0168-6496%2897%2900039-1&partnerID=40&md5=6c519de0dab5450bcab8240c9aed3f5a"

Total assemblages from the surface 2 cm of 30 sites across the marsh and mangrove environments of south-west Florida were investigated. Eight environmental variables, including average salinity, salinity range, pH, total phosphorus, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, and total organic carbon and total inorganic carbon measured on bulk sediments, as well as the elevation and distance from the coastline were determined for each of the 30 sampling locations.In total, 82 species were identified, the majority of which were calcareous. Diversity decreases, dominance increases, and agglutinated taxa increase from the coastline inland. Rotaliina are equally abundant across the intertidal environment, whereas Miliolina are common near the coast and in lagoons or inland lakes. The most important factor control-ling foraminiferal distribution is total organic carbon, followed by total inorganic carbon, distance from coastline, total phosphorus, and salinity. Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca indicate lower salinities (<15 psu). Good indicators for higher salinities are Haplophragmoides wilberti (10-20 psu) and Arenoparrella mexicana (10-20 psu and 28-30 psu). Ammonia spp. prefer salinities >15 psu and Elphidium spp. >20 psu. Ammonia tepida, Helenina anderseni, Trochammina in-flata, and A. mexicana prefer organic-rich sediments. Thus, the benthic foraminifera from Everglades sediments are excel-lent salinity proxies and can be used to determine the history of habitat change in this area as well as to assess past trends in the rate of sea level rise.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332409",NA

Trace element geochemistry","Sequential sediment extractions are used to assess the partitioning of Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb, as a function of depth, in the sediments of two pairs of saltmarsh sites, chosen to represent a gradient of macrophyte and macrofaunal density. One pair is located adjacent to a large tidal creek, and includes a nearly unvegetated site and a site densely vegetated by tall-form Spartina alterniflora. The other two sites, located higher in the marsh, are densely vegetated by Juncus roemarianus and sparsely vegetated by short-form S. alternifora. At each site, trace element distributions among four operationally-defined solid fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, reducible and oxidizable) were measured at 4-5 cm intervals from the sediment water interface to a depth of up to 50 cm. The operationally-defined extractions suggest that in suboxic sediments, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co and Zn occur in association with Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides. In sulfidic sediments, Fe, Co and Ni probably occur mostly in pyrite. Mn is likely pyritized and may also form rhodochrosite at two of the sites, Cr is likely bound mostly to organic matter, and Zn, Cu and Pb are inferred to occur in association with both sulfides and organic matter. The depth- and site-dependent trace element distributions are in surprisingly good agreement with variations in redox geochemistry inferred from pore water data in a companion study [Koretsky, C.M., Haveman, M., Cuellar, A., Beuving, L., Shattuck, T., Wagner, M., 2008. Influence of Spartina and Juncus on saltmarsh sediments. I. Pore water geochemistry. Chemical Geology]. This demonstrates that, in spite of their inherently operational nature, sequential sediment extractions can yield useful insights into metal speciation, especially when measured in conjunction with pore water geochemistry. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that lateral and vertical variations in saltmarsh pore water chemistry lead to distinct variability in solid phase trace metal distributions.

The surface sediments of the lagoon were investigated for their benthic foraminiferal content in order to correlate, in general, with environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, pH, sediment grain size, organic matter and, in particular, with tidal elevations to develop a training set for predicting sea-level changes in the lagoon. Hierarchical cluster analysis divided the benthic foraminifera in the Shuaiba Lagoon into four distinct faunal assemblages. Quinqueloculina cf. Q. limbata (Assemblage 1) and Monalysidium acicularis (Assemblage 2) assemblages dominated the intertidal-high subtidal areas (0.3 to -0.5 m, LAT). The Peneroplis planatus-Sorites orbiculus Assemblage 3 occurred abundantly at all subtidal elevations (0 to -1 m, LAT), whereas the Quinqueloculina costata-Spiroloculina communis-Elphidium striatopunctatum Assemblage 4 dominated the lowest elevations (<-1.5 m, LAT) in the lagoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the intertidal-high subtidal assemblages were positively correlated with tidal elevations in the Shuaiba Lagoon, consequently, their training set yielded a model predicting sea-level changes with a precision of +/- 0.16 m, but when they were incorporated with the lowest-elevation (low subtidal and below subtidal) assemblages, a wide error (+/- 0.33 m) was produced. Abundance distributions of all assemblages were also affected by the other environmental factors such as salinity, organic matter and temperature, but pH was an important controlling factor on many assemblages due, likely, to high algal photosynthesis in algal-dense substrates. The effect of these factors on the predictability of the intertidal-high subtidal training set is unavoidable and it could be compromised by making a model from the different niches of the intertidal-high subtidal area.

Human modifications of the coastal zone, in combination with climate induced environmental changes, have had a major effect on the natural ecological systems. GIS analysis of remote sensed data, combined with fieldwork and laboratory tests, can be used to determine the resultant eco-geomorphic changes that need to be managed sustainably on a worldwide scale. Modelling the eco-geomorphic dynamics between 1949 and 2016 on the Wandandian Creek delta (southeastern NSW, Australia) provides a case study of management options for such coastal resources. Results from the Wandandian Creek delta show that sand/silt sediment derived from the partially (22%) modified terrestrial catchment has prograded into the wave-dominated St. Georges Basin where it is impacted by nearshore processes. Clear spatio-temporal growth of the areal extent and elevation of the deltaic levees and sandspits, with their associated mangroves and saltmarshes, has occurred over the past 65 years. Although the growth rate has fluctuated during the study period, due to flood events in 1974, 1990s and 2010, the overall subaerial and subaqueous delta area has had an average growth of 4168 m(2) annually with the shoreline extending 1.451 m/year on average. This geomorphic growth has stabilised the estuarine deltaic habitats with high proportions of nutrients and organic matter, particularly within saltmarsh, mangrove, Casuarina/Juncus and other mixed native plant areas. This research shows the importance of analysing morphological changes observed on the delta that can be related to both anthropogenic modifications and natural processes to the catchment and thus should be used in the development of catchment and coastal management plans.","10.3390/jmse5040055","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332417","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036671273&doi=10.3390%2fjmse5040055&partnerID=40&md5=2983375dfd2b6938dc2ad7f5ad28dd69"

Three plant communities dominate the outer coastal zone, the lowest in elevation being Carex subspathacea grazing lawns, the next being C. ramenskii meadows, and the highest being a slough levee community. We flooded each of these communities in the field with tidal waters (mean total dissolved salts 28.3 +/- 0.7 g L-1) at different frequencies for two growing seasons. Relative to controls, treatments that were flooded weekly had soils that had two-, three-, and six-fold increases in salinity in the C. subspathacea, C. ramenskii, and slough levee communities, respectively. We detected no effect of flooding on either soil carbon or nitrogen mineralization, nor any effect on live plant standing biomass and net aboveground primary productivity in the most coastal communities, those dominated by C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii. Biomass in the slough levee community was lower in plots that had soil salinities six times higher than the ambient soil salinity. This effect resulted from an 83% decline in woody vegetation. Grass biomass, predominately Poa arctica and Deschampsia caespitosa, increased in these plots, however, and maintained the productivity of this community relative to controls. Geese reduced the biomass of a preferred forage species (Triglochin palustris) by 50% over two growing seasons within the slough levee community. Carex subspathacea compensated for the loss of over 95% of its production by geese, even in soils that had twice the ambient salinity. The C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii communities are resistant to short-term tidal inundation and elevated soil salinities, and grazing by geese is responsible for maintaining their community boundaries. Elevated soil salinity and tidal inundation restricts the development of woody vegetation in the slough levee community, but graminoids compensate for the reduction in woody biomass and maintain the overall productivity of this community.","10.1080/11956860.2003.11682784","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332419","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0346934910&doi=10.1080%2f11956860.2003.11682784&partnerID=40&md5=313d42c80b75a6d97e67bf2a95a8659f"

Forty-four superficial sediment samples were collected along distance-to-sea and elevation gradients in the winter and summer of 2010. Fifty-three foraminifera species were identified along the intertidal margins of the estuary. Foraminiferal distribution reflected seasonal variation of environmental factors, whose relative importance varied according to species tolerances. Elevation in relation to mean sea level appeared to be the most important parameter controlling foraminiferal distribution, probably because it combines the effects of a series of other variables (i.e. organic matter, sediment texture, pH and temperature). In the highest marsh areas, where environmental conditions approach survival thresholds, only some agglutinated species are able to survive. In the lower intertidal zone, where subaerial exposure is diminished and environmental conditions are generally less variable, more diverse faunas, mainly composed of calcareous species, prevail. During winter, when fluvial discharge peaks, agglutinated species represent more than 80% of the total individuals. In summer, when marine conditions prevail, calcareous species become more competitive, increase their densities and expand into higher marsh zones and estuarine upper reaches. In the estuary, three different foraminiferal assemblages are distinguished: i) Miliammina fusca assemblage, which dominates in unvegetated areas of the lower marsh and tidal flats of the mid-upper estuary; ii)Jadammina macrescens assemblage, which dominates in the highest marsh areas in the lower estuary; and iii) Ammonia aberdoveyensis assemblage, which dominates the areas of low marsh and tidal flats of the lower estuary.

This study examined trophic links of macrobenthic food web with primary production in diverse wetland habitats along the riverine-estuarine-coastal marine continuum. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of macrobenthic assemblages collected along the salinity gradient of the main channel and their putative sources of organic matter (i.e., riverine particulate organic matter (RPOM), Phragmites australis, microphytobenthos (MPB), phytoplankton, and Zostera marina) were determined. A permutational analysis of variance test showed seasonal uniformity in the isotopic niches of the macrobenthic community within different channel locations. In contrast, isotopic nestedness calculated for the microbenthic community emphasized clearly different trends in its isotopic niches among locations. The delta C-13 values of phytoplankton, suspended and sedimentary organic matter, and macrobenthic community displayed a consistently positive relationship with salinity, characterizing an important contribution of local phytoplankton to the nutrition of macrobenthic community. The isotope mixing model revealed that Phragmites-derived organic matter contributed considerably to the nutrition in the estuarine channel, whereas MPB and Zostera provided trophic subsidies to the deep bay and offshore communities. The nutritional importance of RPOM was minimal at all sites. Overall results suggest that phytoplankton production is a major nutritional contributor to the macrobenthic community in the main channel and that trapping POM originated from neighboring wetlands leads to a longitudinal isotopic niche shift in the macrobenthic community.","10.1007/s12237-019-00543-z","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332437",NA

The ancient Maritime Maya inhabitants of Vista Alegre in the northeastern Yucatan were active seafaring peoples. However, the past coastal landscape environmental history is unknown. Previous research concentrated on the fully terrestrial component of the site, and did not approach the issue from an earth sciences, sedimentological perspective. In this study, a sediment core campaign in the shallow offshore of Vista Alegre aimed to reconstruct the coastal and environmental changes that occurred over the past 3000 years, and specifically identify the changes in sea-level. Nine cores were analyzed using a multi-proxy approach including a range of sedimentological parameters such as granulometry, micropaleontology (foraminifera), radiocarbon dating, and loss on ignition. The sediment cores provided an archive of environmental changes related to sea-level change, anthropogenic influence, and shifting microenvironments which can be associated with cultural time periods. The environmental phases and shifts show some linkage to the archaeological chronology, suggesting an association between the environmental conditions and human activities. Sea-level changes and shifting shorelines have always been, and still are, a challenge for coastal settlements, and ancient sites can be a harbinger of what to anticipate in the future. In addition to this, current natural and anthropogenic pressures on coastlines are placing archaeological sites at increasing risk and thereby threatening this important scientific and cultural archive.

Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2-S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S-0, reactive iron (Fe-HCl), C-ORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1-11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (Sigma H2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong Sigma H2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.","10.1016/0016-7037(95)00163-T","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332441",NA

However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.","10.1029/2019JG005459","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332449",NA

The benthic fauna and clam samples were collected in the intertidal sediment in October 2010 from five sites of the Rio San Pedro (RSP) creek, following a gradient of contamination from the aquaculture effluent to the control site. Numbers of species, abundance, richness and Shannon diversity were the biodiversity indicators measured in benthic fauna. Morphological and reproduction status of clams were assessed using the condition factor and gonado-somatic index, respectively. Phase I and Phase II detoxification enzymatic activities (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST)), antioxidant enzymatic activities (glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR)) and oxidative stress parameters (Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) and DNA strand breaks) were measured in clams' digestive gland tissues. In parallel, temperature and salinity in the adjacent water, redox potential, pH and organic matter in sediment, and dissolved oxygen in the interstitial water were measured. The results suggested that RSP showed a spatial gradient characterised by hypoxia/anoxia, reduced potential, acidic conditions and high organic enrichment in sediments at the most contaminated sites. Significant (p<0.05) decrease of biodiversity indicators were observed in the areas impacted by the aquaculture discharges. Biomarkers did not show a clear pattern and of all biochemical responses tested, GPX, DNA damage and LPO were the most sensitive ones and showed significant (p<0.05) increase in the polluted sites. Benthic biodiversity indicators were significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with pH, redox potential and dissolved oxygen and negatively correlated with organic matter. On the contrary, antioxidant enzymatic responses (GPX) and oxidative stress parameters were significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with those physico-chemical parameters. It has been demonstrated that effluents from fish aquaculture activities in Rio San Pedro creek may produce an alteration of physicochemical characteristics of seabed and induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in soft-sediment species which may lead to changes of the benthic population structure and health status of the exposed organisms.

Benthic DOC fluxes were seasonal with the highest rates generally observed during summer. Most habitats displayed uptake of DOC during the dark and efflux during the light, and were a net source of DOC to the overlying waters over the diel cycle. Macrophyte habitats (seagrass and macroalgae) had the highest benthic fluxes of DOC (up to similar to 50 mmol C m (2) d (1)). Organic matter supply to the sediment was dominated by in situ production, and both quantity and source exerted control over benthic DOC fluxes. DOC flux was tightly coupled to bacteria and algal PLFA concentrations during summer, and algal PLFA concentrations during winter, indicating a strong influence of microbial interactions on benthic DOC flux and a temperature-related decoupling of algae and bacteria under cooler conditions. Estimates of the global estuarine benthic DOC flux indicate that these areas are a significant source of DOC to the ocean (1-41 Tg C yr(-1)). Inclusion of macrophyte, salt marsh, mangrove, and intertidal benthic DOC flux estimates resulted in a higher global continental margin benthic DOC flux (106-416 Tg C yr(-1)) than the previous estimate (90 Tg C yr(-1)).","10.1029/2010JG001433","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332468","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650589670&doi=10.1029%2f2010JG001433&partnerID=40&md5=5e19d440c95bf8947d6bdf3e46633c31"

Sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) samples were collected along the river, from upstream (draining predominantly pine-oak forests) in the Pinelands to the Great Bay Estuary (bordered by salt marshes) under normal and high flow conditions. During base river flow, terrestrial biomarkers (e.g., diterpenoids - conifer biomarkers) were detected predominantly upstream and sharply decreased downstream. From mid to down river sites, a mixture of higher plants (primarily from the salt marsh vegetation) and microbial biomarkers (e.g., mycose, cholesterol) predominated. delta C-13 abundances of individual fatty acids presented a consistent pattern, with depleted values (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -30.9 parts per thousand on average) upstream, becoming heavier toward the Great Bay (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -23.1 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -22.8 parts per thousand). During the high discharge event, significant amounts of upland biomarkers (e.g., pimaric acid, ferruginol, ursolic acid) and depleted delta C-13 values were observed from the Pinelands (delta C-13(sed) = -34.6 parts per thousand) to mid river (delta C-13(sed) = -32.0 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -30.8 parts per thousand), clearly demonstrating the transport of terrestrial material farther down river. However, downstream of this point, the occurrence of the terrestrial material strongly decreased, demonstrating that terrestrial plant biomarkers were not transported in significant amounts to the estuarine region, even at high river discharge. Since the mid river site is situated in the upper limit of salt water intrusions, it is likely that flocculation and sedimentation provide a depositional sink for terrestrial OC in the mid Mullica River, thereby depleting the terrigenous signature in downstream OC.

Organic carbon determinations were carried out by a wet oxidation technique, and 'organic fraction' metals were separated by sequential leaching. Results demonstrated that organic phase metals are quantitatively significant in Severn Estuary sediments, particularly Cu and Zn (Cu > Zn), and that metals are probably released from this fraction during early diagenesis.

Palynological data reveal a development from Betula carr to saltmarsh via an intermediate environment with pollen and spores derived from both seaward and landward facies.

The evidence suggest the existence of a previously unrecorded successional environment between coastal reedswamp and saltmarsh facies. This environment occurred in broad, shallow gradient coastal settings during periods of rapid saltmarsh growth.

The study was carried out during a period of neap and spring tides over 14 consecutive days. Bacteria, microphyloplankton and zooplankton direct counts were made, along with fractionated respiratory activity. Nutrient, C/N ratio, total organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, carbon, seston, dissolved oxygen, particulate silica and chlorophyll a determinations were also made. Phytoplankton biomass was low (9.5-mu-g C l-1) and was exceeded by bacterial biomass (89.4-mu-g C l-1) at both spring and neap tides. Bacterial abundance was independent of tidal height and increased with intense water movement at spring tides. Autotrophic production was limited by light penetration and nutrient availability. Most of the respiratory activity in the water column (> 50 %) occurred in the less-than-or-equal-to 0.8-mu-m size fraction. Bacterial standing stocks sustained carbon production in the water column. Significant negative correlation between bacteria and nanoplankton suggests a trophic structure dependent on dissolved organic carbon inputs from marsh flora, followed by a trophic chain composed of bacteria, nanoplankton, microzooplankton and Acartia sp. It is suggested that food chains stemming from dissolved organic carbon instead of phytoplankton may play a major role in the system since tidal dynamics enhanced bacterial standing stocks during spring and neap tides.","10.3354/meps078229","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332492",NA

Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C-org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C-org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrass-saltmarsh habitats. Age-depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C-org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C-org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C-org sequestration in coastal habitats.","10.1111/gcb.14558","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332503","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060585065&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14558&partnerID=40&md5=4f1dbe875fdc59c2daebe287f5d8d87c"

Such a model should follow classic patterns of soil nutrient pools described for alluvial ecosystems that are dominated by mineral matter high in phosphorus and low in carbon and nitrogen. A contrast with classic models of soil development is the anthropogenically enriched high nitrate conditions due to agricultural fertilization in upstream watersheds. Here we determine if short-term patterns of soil chemistry and dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes along the emerging Wax Lake delta (WLD) chronosequence are consistent with conceptual models of long-term nutrient availability described for other ecosystems. We add a low nitrate treatment more typical of historic delta development to evaluate the role of nitrate enrichment in determining the net dinitrogen (N-2) flux. Throughout the 35-year chronosequence, soil nitrogen and organic matter content significantly increased by an order of magnitude, whereas phosphorus exhibited a less pronounced increase. Under ambient nitrate concentrations (> 60 mu M), mean net N-2 fluxes (157.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) indicated greater rates of gross denitrification than gross nitrogen fixation; however, under low nitrate concentrations (< 2 mu M), soils switched from net denitrification to net nitrogen fixation (-74.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). As soils in the WLD aged, the subsequent increase in organic matter stimulated net N-2, oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite fluxes producing greater fluxes in more mature soils. In conclusion, soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation along an emerging delta chronosequence largely coincide with classic patterns of soil development described for alluvial floodplains, and substrate age together with ambient nitrogen availability can be used to predict net N-2 fluxes during early delta evolution.","10.1007/s10021-013-9727-3","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332505",NA

We determined the elemental and C- and N-isotopic compositions of organic material (OM) in surface sediments and sediment cores from the Gulf of Trieste (N Adriatic), an area characterized by relatively high riverine input. This multiple tracer approach permits evaluation of how sensitive each tracer is for constraining the terrestrial component of OM. Using the relevant terrestrial and marine OM end-members, we estimate that the terrestrial contribution ranges from about 90% at the mouth of the Isonzo River and decreases to <= 10% in the center of the Gulf. In the southern part of the Gulf, 32-44% of terrestrial OC is contributed from smaller rivers, while the delta(15)N values of OM reflect more effective nutrient utilization. Analyses of different size fractions show that smaller particles are consistently more organic-rich and tend to be transported further from the river mouth, depending on river discharge. In the size fraction 2-16 mu m, elemental ratios and delta(13)C(org) and delta(15)N isotopic signatures are consistent with a sedimentary OM pool dominated by bacterially derived biomass. Radiocarbon analyses of sedimentary OC yield depleted Delta(14)C values (-338.7 parts per thousand to -429.4 parts per thousand), indicating a significant fraction of relatively old OC. The natural abundance of C-13 and C-14 tracers suggests a two-component mixture of ancient and modem C in the sediments down to approximately 60 cm sub-bottom, with an estimated similar to 45% of sedimentary OC probably being derived from ancient sedimentary OC (kerogen). In addition, there is a significant change in the source of organic material downcore in these sediments which, along with geological evidence, indicate contributions from freshwater swamps typical of coastal lakes with intermittent connections to the sea (brackish) prior to similar to 9000 BP. Depth variations in a core from a salt marsh further indicate temporal variability of OM deposition and transformations in a changing brackish-marine environment in the past. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the individual- and population-level traits of ecosystem engineers can affect their ability to reduce environmental stress. On the Patagonian shores of Argentina (SW Atlantic, 41 degrees S), the intertidal community is exposed to harsh conditions. We predicted that in this severe environment, variation in the above-ground structure of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora should buffer the physical stress on the substrate through shading and reduction of wind and water flow energy, ultimately affecting the sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated cordgrass density at the edge and inner marsh of a S. alterniflora meadow during both summer and winter. In summer, evaporation and temperature were higher in clipped plots, while in winter, evaporation varied across densities and location treatments, with higher sediment water content in the inner marsh. No effect of S. alterniflora density or location were observed on sediment organic matter or chl a concentration, and mean sediment grain size was always smaller inside the marsh. In summer, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content was higher in clipped plots inside the marsh, however this did not differ from the other density treatments at this location. Overall, shading had weak effects on sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass, and most observed differences were attributable to grain size. We speculate that the harsh conditions of this system overwhelm the ecosystem engineering effects of S. alterniflora, probably because of its relatively small above-ground biomass.","10.3354/meps11726","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332514","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971246238&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11726&partnerID=40&md5=b79109b413f82e2137bfa4c3e270b6e4"

The width of the beds varied from approximately 5 in to 1000 in, depending upon the topography and tidal influence. The most extensive and healthy stands occurred in the regularly (20-50 tides month(-1)) inundated intertidal zones. The width of Salicornia beds in the Gulf of Kutchchh was greater than those along the Tamilnadu coast due to greater (0.83-7.2 in) tidal amplitude and flat topography. The sediments from beds of the Gulf of Kutchchh were rich (4.9-16.9% dry weight) in organic matter. The salt content in the sediments from Tamilnadu was relatively very low (0.08-0.1% dry weight) compared to sediments from the Gulf of Kutchchh (0.48-0.78% dry weight). Plant biomass, density, height, and frequency of occurrence in the more frequently inundated regions were greater than in the poorly or less frequently inundated intertidal regions. The average total biomass varied from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) and was mostly comprised of aboveground components. Peak biomass values of Salicornia were observed during September to February in the Gulf of Kutchchh, while along the southeast coast, they were observed during December to March. The growth of the S. brachiata seemed to be influenced primarily by the frequency of inundation, duration of atmospheric exposure at ebb tide, rainfall, and salinity and salt content of the ambient water and sediments, respectively. Average carbon and nitrogen content in the plants were estimated to be 21.7 +/- 1.9% and 0.8 +/- 0.17% (dry weight), respectively. The carbon content increased with increasing age of the plant, while protein content decreased. Constantly increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal wetlands warrant immediate protection of S. brachiata and other obligate halophytes, which are either threatened/vulnerable or endangered.","10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022[0443:EOOMSB]2.0.CO;2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332526",NA

Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) also play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively. The abundance of both methanogens and SRB in the sediment of the P. australis marsh with the highest sediment organic carbon content was higher than in the C. malaccensis and S. alterniflora marshes. Mean pore water DMS concentrations over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile under the S. alterniflora marsh were higher than those in the C. malaccensis marsh and P. australis marsh. Methane production rate correlated weakly with the abundance of methanogens across the three marsh zones together, but did not correlate with the concentrations of pore water acetate and DMS. Our results suggest that the abundance of methanogens is controlled by sediment organic carbon supply, and further, methane production is affected by the abundance of methanogens in the subtropical estuarine brackish marshes.","10.1007/s12237-014-9930-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332532","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943350835&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-014-9930-2&partnerID=40&md5=bab2330041b343b09fc85c646fff054c"

Chemical and physical analysis included moisture and ash contents, maceral groups, vitrinite reflectance, total carbon, bitumen and its fractions, as well as characterization of saturated hydrocarbons by gas chromatography (n-alkane distributions and pristane/phytane ratios). A production sample, representative of the Seam 4, was further analyzed for S, Cl, C, H, O and its calorific value determined. The data collected allowed us to classify these samples as high-volatile bituminous coals, types B and C, according to ASTM classification.The results of the analysis showed little vertical or lateral variation in the properties studied. A gradual increase in ash content in the westward direction, together with a thinning of the coal seam, suggest a greater proximity of the basin border in this direction. High values in pristane/phytane ratio (4-7), predominance of heavy alkanes and high contents in vitrinites clearly indicates that primigenic organic matter was essentially continental in character. However, the bimodal n-alkane distribution, together with a high sulfur (2.7%) and chlorine (0.12%) contents suggest a marine-influenced environment. In consequence, it is proposed that these coals were formed in a transitional environment, as salt-marshs in coastal lagoons or in low deltaic plains. These results are in agreement with the stratigraphic analysis of the sedimentary unit.","10.1016/0895-9811(95)00006-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332533",NA

Different geochemical fractions of sedimentary P were separated and quantified using the sequential extraction (SEDEX) method to evaluate the abundance, sources, distribution, bioavailability and ecological risk of P in surface sediments of the Cross River estuary system (CRES) and adjacent shelf. Sediment grain size composition and bulk organic carbon were also determined. Total P (TP) ranged from 9.21-18.2 mu mol/g (average, 13.30 +/- 2.08 mu mol/g), and comprised mostly of inorganic P (IP) (IP/TP = similar to 87%). Generally, authigenic P (Ca-P) was the dominant IP fraction (Ca-P/IP = similar to 37 +/- 11.1%), representing an important long-term P reservoir. The range of organic carbon (OC) to organic P (OP) ratio (OC/OP) indicated the predominance of terrestrial OC, and that leachable OP (Le-OP) may be the major OP form in surface sediments of the study area. The partitioning and distribution of different sedimentary P fractions were controlled by the biogeo- and physicochemical conditions favorable for P transformation, sediment grain size composition and sources of sedimentary organic matter. The ratio (Fe/P) of the extractable Fe in citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate solution (Fe-CDB) to ferric oxide-bound P(Fe-P) revealed the presence of reactive Fe- matrices having strong sorption capacity for P. The contents of potential bioavailable P (BAP) (similar to 34-60% of TP) indicated that P amount in the overlying water column may increase substantially if released from surface sediments. The Fe-P was the major component of BAP, and the relationship between BAP and extractable Fe-CDB highlighted the significant impact of Fe(III) (oxyhdr)oxides on P mobility and bioavailability. The estimated P enrichment index (PEI) indicated that surface sediment is less impacted by anthropogenic P and poses less ecological risk with respect to sedimentary TP load in the study area.","10.1016/j.jmarsys.2019.103244","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332535",NA

We quantified total C and N pools, and mobile fractions including extractable mineral N, extractable organic C and N, and active (aerobically mineralizable) C and N, in surface soils (top 7.6 cm) of adjacent mangrove (primarily Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh (Juncus roemerianus) vegetation zones in tidal wetlands of west-central Florida (USA). We tested whether surface-soil accumulations of C, N, and their potentially mobile fractions are greater in mangrove than in saltmarsh owing to greater accumulations in the mangrove zone of soil organic matter (SOM) and fine mineral particles (C- and N-retaining soil constituents). Extractable organic fractions were 39-45% more concentrated in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soil, and they scaled steeply and positively with SOM and fine mineral particle (silt + clay) concentrations, which themselves were likewise greater in mangrove soil. Elevation may drive this linkage. Mangrove locations were generally at lower elevations, which tended to have greater fine particle content in the surface soil. Active C and extractable mineral N were marginally (p < 0.1) greater in mangrove soil, while active N, total N, and total C showed no statistical differences between zones. Extractable organic C and N fractions composed greater shares of total C and N pools in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soils, which is meaningful for ecosystem function, as persistent leaching of this fraction can perpetuate nutrient limitation. The active (mineralizable) C and N fractions we observed constituted a relatively small component of total C and N pools, suggesting that mangrove surface soils may export less C and N than would be expected from their large total C and N pools.

J.; Alvarez-Rogel, J.","2015","Contribution of soil properties to the assessment of a seawater irrigation programme as a management strategy for abandoned solar saltworks","The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, it's not clear how hydrochemical characteristics affect the wetland's source or sink function or how they affect C, N, and P cycling in arid regions. To clarify these relationships, we conducted field measurement in arid northern China. We simulated the variations of hydrochemical characteristics and the storage and stoichiometry of C, N, and P using the process-based DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Hydrus-1D models. The meteorological and hydrological processes had obvious characteristics of seasonal and interannual changes. The measured evapotranspiration averaged 660.23 and 587.94 mm year(-1)in the saltmarsh and riparian wetlands, respectively. The soil showed a clear trend with higher SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl(-)fractions in comparison with lower Mg2+, K+, and HCO(3)(-)fractions, with the major ion and nutrient concentrations gradually decreasing with increasing depth in the soil. The major ion types had characteristics of Na+-Ca2+-SO42--Cl(-)in the saltmarsh wetland and riparian wetland.

PCB concentrations were relatively low, although the penta- and hexachlorobiphenyl detected in sediments and biota indicated that there had been direct inputs of PCBs into the ecosystem. Heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endosulfan sulphate, chlordane compounds, DDT and metabolites, and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were the major pesticides detected in sediment and biota samples. When lipid-normalized concentration data for all OC pesticides in crabs were summed together (Sigma OCC), there were higher concentrations in crabs from the cordgrass habitat in comparison to crabs from the mudflat. In sediment samples, there were no significant differences in percent organic matter of marsh and mudflat sediments, but the concentrations of Sigma OCC normalized to organic carbon were higher in the sediments collected in the cordgrass marsh. Samples of rhizomes and roots from the cordgrass contained high concentrations of OC compounds and it was estimated that 2.4 kg of heptachlor epoxide, the most abundant OC pesticide, may be present in the total cordgrass root biomass in Mar Chiquita lagoon. These data indicated that the cordgrass in coastal lagoon environments is an important factor in determining the distribution of persistent contaminants, and that a significant portion of the total burden of these hydrophobic compounds may be deposited in cordgrass biomass.","10.2307/1353148","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332612",NA

The field study was carried out along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay of Fundy in high and low zones at three marshes with different tidal ranges. We used a total of 16 benchmark pipes and controlled for daily variability in evapotranspiration (ET), as well as timing of tidal flooding, two factors that affect soil water storage, and consequently soil volume. In six of nine trials we detected significant elevation change over periods as short as 5 d. Marsh-wide averages ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 rum, greater than the yearly increase in relative sea level in many regions. Wood Point marsh had the highest tidal range, but lowest soil organic matter content, giving its soils the lowest compressibility and little sensitivity to ET during two of three trials; the average change in elevation in Wood Point high marsh stations was 4.0 mm during the last trial. Greater differences later in the growing season (while temperature changes were minor) at Wood Point and another site suggest that plant transpiration drove changes in water storage at those sites. Significantly greater differences in elevation with lower plant cover in the third marsh suggests that evaporation drove changes in water storage there. Surface elevation change due to ET should be of greatest concern to SET users in temperate regions where there are large changes in plant biomass and variable temperatures. Variation due to plant transpiration could be reduced if yearly monitoring is scheduled before the start of the growing season.","10.1007/BF02803562","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332613","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2142647475&doi=10.1007%2fBF02803562&partnerID=40&md5=6db438e995e58397e064da0f33e85746"

Major changes in taxa along the tidal gradient are similar except for the lowest elevations, where different taxa become dominant at different sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) shows that assemblage composition is also strongly related to other variables, independent of the tidal position. Salinity, particle size and organic matter content are particularly important, and there is a statistically significant geographical effect on assemblages. Relationships between sea-level and assemblage composition are often stronger for individual sites, suggesting that local data sets should be used for quantitative sea-level reconstructions. However, the combined data set would provide more robust estimates of past sea-level change from fossil data. Other environmental variables explain as much of the variability in species assemblages as tidal parameters and should be considered more often in sea-level reconstructions based on microfossil indicators.

In arid Baja California Sur, México","Due to its geographical situation, Baja California Sur is the most arid Mexican state, with the longest length of coast in the country. Hence, the study of halophytes for incorporation into rural agriculture is a priority for this region. In this research, the growth and development of a natural population of the oilseed halophyte Salicornia bigelovii Torr. as affected by environmental factors are analysed. Four transects were traced in the field, with sample sites of 1 m2 every 3 m along each transect from which samples of soil and plants for laboratory analysis were taken, starting at the lowest seashore tide line. Edaphic and environmental factors as well as biomass, plant density, size, and dry matter were analysed through multivariate statistical methods. Three edaphic factors showed correlation with growth and development of individuals: growth was positively correlated with soil organic matter, and negatively correlated with the percentage of sand as a component of texture and with the balance of sodium (SAR parameter) in the soil saturated paste. Part of the results are unexpected because most of the previous work had dealt only with the salinity factor. The results will enable us to determine the next steps to promote the economic use of this species in the study region.","10.1016/S0140-1963(05)80058-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332622","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028162118&doi=10.1016%2fS0140-1963%2805%2980058-8&partnerID=40&md5=63e925c043da5c07349eafb52ddc0e66"

The averaged aboveground to belowground ratio was 12.0. Aboveground and belowground biomass were negatively correlated with pH of soil, while positively with soil electrical conductivity. Further, there were positive relationships between organic carbon and belowground biomass; and available sodium and aboveground biomass. The nutrient pools in aboveground were always higher than to belowground biomass. Aboveground pools of carbon (543kgha(-1)), nitrogen (48kgha(-1)), phosphorus (4kgha(-1)), sodium (334kgha(-1)) and potassium (37kgha(-1)) were maximum in the month of March 2015.

Despite their abundance, very little baseline data is available from them and few studies have documented the ecosystems services that they provide. This information is important for conservation efforts as well as for an increased understanding of how fringing marshes function compared to larger marsh meadow systems. Benthic infaunal invertebrates were sampled from cores collected from Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh, Spartina patens-dominated high marsh, and Phragmites australis-invaded high marsh zones of nine fringing marsh ecosystems in Casco Bay, Maine, USA. Infaunal densities and biomass were generally higher in low marsh than high marsh or P. australis cores. Invertebrate community structure was significantly different between low marsh and high marsh and P. australis cores, which was attributed to significantly higher pore water salinity, lower organic matter, total plant percent cover, and S. patens cover in low marsh zones. There were no differences in invertebrate densities, biomass, or community structure when high marsh and P. australis cores were compared. Invertebrate densities and community structure were dominated by oligochaetes in all zones. Oligochaetes were also an important component of infaunal biomass, but the less abundant and larger invertebrates such as green crabs, tanaids, and bivalves were also large contributors to biomass in the low marsh zone. Low marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by significantly higher densities of nematodes, Nereis virens, an unidentified oligochaete, the bivalves Gemma gemma and Mya arenaria, and Leptochelia rapax. High marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by higher densities of insects, specifically Culicoides sp. ceratopogonid larvae and Anurida maritima, as well as an unidentified species of mite. Our results revealed a diverse and abundant infaunal invertebrate community that likely supports similar ecosystem services in fringing marshes as invertebrates in larger marsh meadows.","10.1007/s12237-015-9977-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332629","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931957648&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-015-9977-8&partnerID=40&md5=791cdfbd7204aa2df7583164d0dccca5"

Here we present the results of a comprehensive vegetation and sediment delta C-13 and C/N survey of Welwich Marsh (outer Humber Estuary, UK), together with high-resolution delta C-13 and C/N analyses of Holocene cores collected nine years previously from the Humber Estuary and the Lincolnshire Marshes, Eastern England, UK. The contemporary intertidal delta C-13 and C/N dataset shows a gradual increase in surface sediment delta C-13 with decreasing marsh height and suggests that delta C-13 is controlled by the degree of tidal inundation and thus reflects organic matter source. However, sediment C/N ratios are less sensitive to tidal changes and the recent introduction Of C-4 salt-marsh species complicates the contemporary analogue. The Holocene delta C-13 and C/N records are in general agreement with existing microfossil data and provide additional palacoenvironmental information. This includes support for an estuary-wide expansion of marine conditions from c. 3.3 ka cal. yr BP, followed by a contraction of marine conditions after c. 2.7 ka cal. yr BP, and evidence for an increase in delivery of terrigenous organic matter to the inner estuary in the late Holocene. Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis is shown to be a reliable and independent indicator of coastal environmental change and is therefore a complementary technique to the more commonly used microfossil approach. However, this study also shows that in some circumstances the technique may be compromised when applied to sediments from cores that have been stored for a period of time.

Total Hg ranged from 0.01 to 12.07 mg/kg, with a mean of 2.10 mg/kg (n = 351). Concentrations of the toxic metal decreased downstream from London to the outer estuary and were positively correlated to total organic carbon (TOC) content. Many Hg profiles showed a clear rise, peak and fall, reflecting changing anthropogenic input through time. Surface concentrations averaged 1.27 mg/kg, confirming the effectiveness of recent environmental legislation and improved river management. Sediments at > 40 cm depth from London reaches of the river (Waterloo Bridge, Cuckolds Point (Rotherhithe), Butlers Wharf (Tower Bridge), Millwall, Deptford and Millennium Dome) were highly contaminated, with levels of Hg of > 7 mg/kg. The outer Thames had lower Hg, with the exception of Rainham, Crossness and Cliffe. Benchmarking against UK guidelines for the disposal of dredged material revealed that 88 samples from 21 sites exceeded the 3 mg/kg criteria (unsuitable for disposal at sea); 173 fell between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg (further assessment required); and 90 were of no concern.

A characterization of a fringing ecosystem was conducted to provide initialization and calibration data for the development of a simulation model. The model simulates primary production and material exchange in the littoral zone of lower Chesapeake Bay. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) properties of water and sediments from sand, seagrass, intertidal silt-mud, and intertidal marsh habitats of the Goodwin Islands (located within the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Virginia, CBNERR-VA) were determined seasonally. Spatial and temporal differences in sediment microalgal biomass among the habitats were assessed along with annual variations in the distribution and abundance of Zostera marina L. and Spartina alterniflora Loisel. Phytoplankton biomass displayed some seasonality related to riverine discharge, but sediment microalgal biomass did not vary spatially or seasonally. Macrophytes in both subtidal and intertidal habitats: exhibited seasonal biomass patterns that were consistent with other Atlantic estuarine ecosystems. Marsh sediment organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen differed significantly from that of the sand, seagrass, and silt habitats. The only biogeochemical variable that exhibited seasonality was low marsh NH,I. The subtidal sediments were consistent temporally in their carbon and nitrogen content despite seasonal changes in seagrass abundance. Eelgrass has a comparatively low C:N ratio and is a potential N sink for the ecosystem. Changes in the composition or size of the vegetated habitats could have a dramatic influence over resource partitioning within the ecosystem. A spatial database (or geographic information system, GIS) of the Goodwin Islands site has been initiated to track long-term spatial habitat features and integrate model output and field data. This ecosystem characterization was conducted as part of efforts to link field data, geographic information, and the dynamic simulation of multiple habitats. The goal of these efforts is to examine ecological structure, function, and change in fringing environments of lower Chesapeake Bay.","10.2307/1353271","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332653",NA

We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation. Our study illustrates the challenges in moving from simple conceptual models of disturbance to empirical studies in which multiple variables are likely to be affected differently and follow different recovery trajectories.","10.1002/lno.11867","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332654","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108861787&doi=10.1002%2flno.11867&partnerID=40&md5=25ab67b2a55fb57495a2eeab0e9f99ec"

Mining waste deposits from an ancient metallurgical extraction of heavy metals were found near to the San Antonio marsh in Patagonia. The aim of this work was to determinate which mechanisms regulate the mobilization and retention of metals by acid drainage. A geological and geomorphological survey was carried out and samples from the mining waste deposits and the marsh were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe content, and soil mineralogical composition. Metals in marsh plants were determined in above-and below -ground structures. In the mining waste deposits polymetallic sulphides were recognized where the oxidation and formation of oxy-hydroxides and sulphates of Fe, Cu, Pb and Zn occurs. Then, by the alteration of those minerals, the metals enter in solution and are mobilized with the surface drainage towards the marsh where adsorption in the soils fine fraction and organic matter and/or by plants occurs. Locally, in the mining waste deposits, the precipitation/dissolution of Cu, Pb, and Zn sulphates take place in small centripetal drainage basins. In topographically lower portions of the marsh desorption and removal of metals by tidal flow could also be happen. The results allow to concluding that the marsh adjacent to the mining waste deposits is a geochemically active environment that naturally mitigates the contamination caused by acid drainage.

Two boreholes with total depths of 26 and 16.5 m were selected for a multi-proxy detailed laboratory analysis, including mean grain size distribution, organic matter (OM) content, color variation, shell identification, and benthic foraminifera assemblages. Selected cores are thought to be representative of the identified depositional sub-basins. Subsurface age data from 16 AMS C-14 dated samples were plotted against depth and resulted in a coherent age model of sedimentary infill. The system evolution was largely controlled by sediment availability, accommodation space, and Holocene sea level rise, first at a rapid rate of 7 mm/yr from 10 kcal yr BP to 7.25 kcal yr BP, followed by a slowdown to 1.1 mm/yr until present. A conceptual model for the origin and Holocene evolution of the Ria Formosa barrier island system implies three main steps, leading to the present system geomorphology: (1) marine flooding of incised palaeovalleys by the rapid transgression of palaeovalleys in the early Holocene; (2) development of a proto-barrier island chain perched on Pleistocene detritic headlands and steeper interfluve areas during the early to middle Holocene; and (3) full development of the barrier islands chain and enclosing of the coastal lagoon, followed by the maturation of the system with subsequent siltation and salt marsh expansion from the middle Holocene until present.

Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %). Most soil aggregates had residual Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and reducible Cd, Pb dominated in the total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates. Although mud soil showed low total concentrations of heavy metals, the relatively high concentrations of bioavailable Cd and Cu resulted from the relatively high Cd (F2) and Cu (F2) in the > 2 mm aggregates indicated contribution of carbonates to soil aggregation and metal adsorption in tidal mud flat.Soil type and aggregate distribution were important factors controlling heavy metal concentration and fractionation in YRD wetland soil. Compared with mud soil, normal soil contained increased concentrations of F5 and F3 of metals in the 0.053-0.25 mm aggregate, and sandy soil contained increased concentrations of bioavailable and total Cr, Ni, and Zn with great contribution of mass loadings in the < 0.053 mm aggregate.

This environment has been affected by severe Hg contamination from both industrial and long-term mining activities. In both saltmarshes, Hg content in sediments exceeded the estimated background value (0.13 mu g g(-1)), showing the highest concentrations (13.7 mu g g(-1)) in the eastern sector (Grado Lagoon), the most affected by cinnabar ore extraction. On the other hand, the saltmarsh, located in the Marano Lagoon, showed a higher degree of contamination for As, Cd and Pb, which can be related to industrial sources. The rhizo-sediments of both halophytes reflected the characteristics of the non-vegetated sediment, with higher organic carbon content and similar metal concentrations. Enrichment Factors (EF=[metal](root)/[metal](rhizo-sediment)) for each sediment layer were calculated for both halophytes, showing metal enrichments in the roots and the presence of preferential layers of metal accumulation. Hg showed accumulation (EF>1) in the roots below the 20 cm depth, with higher contents in S. Fruticosa. As and Cd were accumulated by both halophytes, more efficiently by S. Fruticosa, and the same species showed also accumulation of Pb and Zn. Translocation of metals from the roots to the aboveground biomass was investigated by measuring metal contents in shoots and leaves of the two species. With the exception of Cd and Hg, all metals were present in the aboveground biomass, most evidently for Cr in S. Fruticosa and Zn in L. Vulgare, although the presence of the latter in leaves could be due to plant physiology rather than translocation of the contaminant.","10.1051/e3sconf/20130106006","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332679","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016481201&doi=10.1051%2fe3sconf%2f20130106006&partnerID=40&md5=cb2edc9d5f7de6b45a39da7bfaa4c637"

Chesapeake Bay has low salinity, terrestrially-dominated sediments in the northern bay, seasonally anoxic mesohaline environments in the mid-bay region, and coarser-grained, bioturbated sediments in the more saline southern bay. High rates of sediment sulfur reoxidation and low inputs of labile organic matter limit the burial of authigenic sulfide minerals in northern bay sediments, while the activity of bioturbating organisms in south bay sediments enhances the reoxidation of sulfur. High iron sulfide delta(34)S values in the northern bay are consistent with low sulfate concentrations. A strong bay-wide relationship between organic carbon and iron sulfide concentrations was evident when refractory terrestrial organic matter was considered.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332681",NA

We measured total organic carbon (TOC) and total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS) in sulfate-rich wetland sediments at middle and low elevation saltmarshs along the Yancheng coast, China. Results show that the average TOC concentrations (5.01 +/- 2.31 kg C/m(3)) associated with Spartina sediments in mid elevation sites is much higher than that seen in low elevation mudflats (0.65 +/- 0.25 kg C/m(3)). TRIS concentrations in Spartina sediments ranged from 21.7 +/- 11.2 mu mol.cm(-3) to 3.0 +/- 2.0 mu mol.cm(-3). Within the TRIS pool, elemental sulfur (ES) constituted the lowest fraction (3.6% to 31.4%) and chromium reduced sulfur (CRS) and acid volatile sulfur (AVS) fractions were higher particularly at coasts characterized by siltation, ranging from 29.9% to 62.2% and from 28% to 59%, respectively. AVS or CRS contents correlated positively with dissolved iron/SO42- and pH, while no clear relationship was present between the TRIS fractions and the abundance of sulfate reduction genes or between the TRIS fractions and TOC. Massive pyrite was the dominant authigenic pyrite present at all sites. Our results suggest that with sea level rise, prolonged inundation and rapid siltation would increase TRIS (especially AVS) and TOC accumulation concurrently while coastal erosion and strong waves would reduce both TOC and TRIS accumulation but increase the ES proportion due to exposure to aerobic conditions.","10.1016/j.jmarsys.2020.103415","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332691","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088902668&doi=10.1016%2fj.jmarsys.2020.103415&partnerID=40&md5=0b2fd827ee80e51705887fa0acdf113b"

Two research sites viz., saltmarsh restoration site (SMRS) and impacted site (IP) were selected for this study. Amount of carbon assimilation by saltmarsh plant Porteresia coarctata at SMRS was increased from 165.17 +/- 68.35 to 198.18 +/- 41.32 g/m(2) during the study. The highest carbon assimilation (198.18 +/- 41.32 g/m(2)) was noticed during winter, while the highest biomass (10.47 +/- 0.25 kg/m(2)) was measured from SMRS. Soil compactness, organic matter, organic carbon, field water capacity, plant height, plant biomass and shoot density were found to be significantly (p < 0.05 to 0.01) higher in the SMRS than that of the IS. Seasonal variations of air temperature, water temperature, water pH, water salinity, water transparency, tidal height, inundation period, wave velocity, soil temperature, soil pH, pore water salinity, sedimentation, soil texture particle density, plant height, biomass and shoot density at different significance levels (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01) were noticed throughout the study. Correlation matrix showed that the plant height, biomass and shoot density were positively correlated with sedimentation, and negatively correlated with wave velocity at different significant levels (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01). From the present study, it is evident that SMRS, which was controlled and managed with some artificial inputs not only showed the elevated levels of plant height, biomass, shoot density, sedimentation and carbon assimilation but also exhibited remarkable changes in some of the factors studied rather than impacted site (IS), the findings of which could be helpful for the protection of coastal environment as well as mitigation of climate change impact that will ultimately save the local community from natural calamities in the long run.

We evaluated changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils in both a natural area and a reclaimed area along the coast of Rudong County, China, as well as the effects that these changes had on the OC content of the soils. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was used to determine which factors are most important for driving changes in soil OC at four sites from each area. According to dominant vegetation types, there were significant differences in soil physical and chemical properties and OC content between the reclaimed area and natural coastal area. The mean grain size and pH increased gradually with depth, and values were highest in reclaimed areas. Mean total N (TN), P, and S, salinity, water content, and soil OC were highest in natural areas and decreased with depth. The PLSR model determined that TN, silt content, and sand content were the most important factors affecting soil OC in the reclaimed area, whereas TN, clay content, and water content were important factors affecting soil OC dynamics in the natural coastal areas.

The major types of soils predominating in the soil cover were sampled. The concentrations of trace elements (mg kg(-1)) varied within the following ranges: 119-561 for Mn, 9.5-126 for Zn, 0.082-2.5 for Cd, <0.5-19.2 for Cu, <0.5-132 for Pb, 0.011-0.081 for Hg, <0.5-10.3 for Co, and 7.6-108 for Cr; the concentration of Fe varied from 3943 to 37,899 mg kg-1. The impact of particular soil properties (pH, carbon and nitrogen contents, particle-size distribution) on metal concentrations was analyzed by the methods of correlation, cluster, and factor analyses. The correlation analysis showed that metal concentrations are negatively correlated with the sand content and positively correlated with the contents of silt and clay fractions. The cluster analysis allowed separation of the soils into three clusters. Cluster I included the soils with the high organic matter content formed under conditions of poor drainage; cluster II, the low-humus sandy soils of the divides and slopes; and cluster III, saline soils of coastal marshes. It was concluded that the geomorphic position largely controls the soil properties. The obtained data were compared with data on metal concentrations in other regions of the Russian Arctic. In general, the concentrations of trace elements in the studied soils were within the ranges typical of the background Arctic territories.

In the context of saline conditions, long-term effect of cultivation after reclamation on soil chemical properties has not been well understood. We studied this issue using a case of approximately 60-years cultivation of a coastal saline marsh in Bohai Rim, northern China. The results showed that long-term reclamation significantly decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) (-42.2%) and total nitrogen (TN) (-25.8%) at surface layer (0-30 cm) as well as their stratification ratios (SRs) (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm and 5-10 cm: 50-70 cm). However, there was no significant change in total phosphorus (TP) as well as its SRs under cultivation. Cultivation markedly reduced ratios of SOC to TN, SOC to TP and TN to TP at surface layer (0-30 cm) and their SRs (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm). After cultivation, electrical conductivity and salinity significantly decreased by 60.1% and 55.3% at 0-100 cm layer, respectively, suggesting a great desalinization. In contrast, soil pH at 20-70 cm horizons notably increased as an effect of reclamation. Cultivation also changed compositions of cations at 0-10 cm layer and anions at 5-100 cm layer, mainly decreasing the proportion of Na+, Cl- and SO42-. Furthermore, cultivation significantly reduced the sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage in plow-layer (0-20 cm) but not residual sodium carbonate, suggesting a reduction in sodium harm.","10.1371/journal.pone.0093727","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332716",NA

As a correct species assignment is crucial for ecological studies, the data presented here are substantiated using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genome to verify the systematic status of the mudsnail taxon in question. A comparative molecular analysis involving almost all brackish-water taxa of Hydrobiinae indicates that the populations from the Evros Delta belong to the Pontic species Ventrosia maritima, a taxon that was not reported before from the Mediterranean. Moreover, it appears that in previous studies, the mudsnail populations from the Evros Delta were misidentified. Principal Component Analyses using environmental variables defined station groups among which V maritima showed a significant variation in density. Mudsnail specimens were absent at stations with an immediate access to the sea (salinity 32 - 34 PSU, very fine to fine sand, organic matter 0.3 -1.4 %), they showed intermediate densities (up to 3,000 ind./m(2)) in innermost lagoonal parts (34-35 PSU, very fine sand, organic matter 1.0-1.4 %) and relatively high densities (up to 7,000 ind./m(2)) only in isolated parts (15-17 PSU, fine sand, organic matter 0.5-0.8 %). Contact with the sea, which is strongly correlated with seawater renewal rate and hydrodynamism, was found to be the most important factor affecting mudsnail distributions. The data presented, being the first detailed ecological information available for V. maritima, are compared with the available information for other mudsnail taxa. The present study not only lays the foundation for future comparative eco-genetic works of mudsnail taxa, it also stresses the absolute need for the routine usage of molecular markers in ecological studies involving frequently utilized but systematically poorly understood invertebrate species.","10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0019","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332721",NA

The results indicated that SOC contents and. delta C-13 values were negatively correlated in the soil sections above the depth with maximum delta C-13 ( delta(13) C-max), and positively correlated below this depth. The negative correlation indicated that SOM reduction degree was low, and the rapid turnover compartments were in greater proportions of SOM which were fresh organic matters in the upper soil sections with SOM apparent (14) C ages less than 200 years. The positive correlation was in adverse, and the SOM apparent (14) C ages were usually over 300 years. The degradation rate of SOC was negatively correlated with pedogenesis ages, and remarkably lower below the soil depth with delta(13) C-max than above the depth. The greater the pedogenesis age, the less the decreasing rate of SOC content with time, suggesting that the SOM was mainly of slow turnover compartments. The temporal changes of delta(13) C values in different soil profiles showed similar tendency, 1. e., the VC values above the soil depth with delta C-13(max), increased with time, while those below this depth were in adverse, which correlated well with the temporal changes of SOC contents, due to the distribution of different SOM compartments with soil depth.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332730","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34848840999&partnerID=40&md5=ccf4fd9e7ac833e2214faedd03cdeac2"

The quantity, composition, and spatial distribution of terrigenous organic matter in sediments was determined by elemental (C and N), lignin, and stable carbon isotope analyses. Sediments in the upper Delaware Estuary had low organic carbon content and high lignin content. In contrast, sediments in the lower Delaware Estuary had high organic carbon content and low lignin content. There was a slight decrease in the proportion of syringyl and cinnamyl phenols relative to vanillyl phenols between the upper estuary and lower estuary. Differences in lignin and stable carbon isotope compositions between sediments of the Delaware Estuary and sediments of the Broadkill River estuary (an adjoining salt-marsh estuary) supported previous observations that marshes do not export substantial quantities of organic matter to estuaries. Additional results suggested that lignin-rich sediments were concentrated in the upper estuary, most likely in the zone of high turbidity. Furthermore, algal material diluted lignin-rich sediments, particularly in the lower estuary. The weaker algal signal in bottom sediments compared to that in suspended particulate matter suggested algal material was decomposed either in the water column or at the sediment-water interface. Physical sorting of sediments prior to deposition was also indicated by observations of compositional differences between the upper and lower estuary bottom sediments. Finally, seasonal variations in primary productivity strongly influenced the relative abundance of terrestrial organic matter. In fall, however, the proportion of lignin was greatest because of a combination of greater inputs of terrestrially-derived organic matter, lower river discharge, and a decrease in algal biomass.","10.2307/1352266","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332749","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026269701&doi=10.2307%2f1352266&partnerID=40&md5=bb13cc1ac184b27fd64f47ff67c44137"

Methyl mercury concentrations were not significantly correlated with organic carbon content in the wetland sediments, and mercury-in-biomass enrichment factors were lower (total mercury mean 1.5 +/- 1.9 and MeHg mean = 3.6 +/- 4.8) than published measurements from mercury polluted sites. Modelling estimates found on average 4.4 times more total mercury mass in the intertidal mudflat sediments relative to vegetated wetlands. A negative relationship was observed between MeHg concentrations (below 20 cm depth) and modelled tidal inundation. The mineral fraction within wetland sediments contained 96.2% of the total mercury mass; however, the highest concentrations of mercury species were in root biomass. This research confirms that vegetated coastal wetlands are key areas for formation of bioavailable methyl mercury, and mercury distribution is tied to organic carbon and sulphur speciation.","10.1007/s11270-011-0756-2","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332755","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052277002&doi=10.1007%2fs11270-011-0756-2&partnerID=40&md5=09ad4e2ef64fbd28bed9dec966f06e15"

The race of DMSP degradation and acrylate mineralization by sediment microbes was similar at all sites along this 25-km transect. However, sediments amended with acrylate (or DMSP) showed significantly higher rates of N-2 fixation (measured as acetylene reduction activity) (ARA) in the saline sediments downstream than brackish sediments. These results are consistent with the fact that acrylate stimulated the rates of both denitrification and CO2, production in the saline sediments at the mouth of the river more than tenfold over rates in brackish sediments. Enrichment experiments indicate that microbes capable of using DMSP or acrylate were not present in upstream sediments despite the fact that microbial biomass, percent organic matter, and both glucose-stimulated ARA and denitrification were highest upstream. It appears that acrylate utilizing, N-2 fixing, and denitrifying populations are insignificant in the lower salinity sediments of the estuary. These results may reflect the availability of DMSP, which averaged 10.3 nmol g wet wt(-1) of saline sediments and levels less than our detection limit (1 mu M) in brackish sediments.","10.1007/BF00171575","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332757",NA

(S. alterniflora) has reduced soil bulk density (BD), the mechanisms that underpin this response are still unclear. To explore this pattern, we used a space-for-time substitution approach and collected soil samples from the eastern coast of China, where S. alterniflora ecosystems were established a short period of time after initial invasion. We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on BD through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes. The model showed that these processes explain 82% of the BD variation in response to S. alterniflora invasion. We observed that SOC had the most direct influence on BD, followed by salinity and soil sand content. We also found that S. alterniflora invasion had an important direct influence on the measured variables. Although plant productivity was not directly related to BD, it was indirectly associated with the impacts of plant productivity on salinity. Our results highlight the occurrence of BD variability within an interacting system of soil and plants wherein S. alterniflora invasion leads to a decrease in BD. This work also highlights that identifying the mechanisms driving BD variability in response to S. alterniflora invasion would help to improve our understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.","10.1002/ldr.3859","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332759",NA

The natural and created sites differed in vascular plant cover and sediment grain size, organic content, salinity, and moisture content. Densities of C. californica in the created site changed little during the study period, and were often lower than those in the natural site. The influences of habitat suitability and dispersal limitation on C. californica colonization of the created site varied among snail age classes. Sediment moisture and organic content explained some of the variability in subadult (47%) and adult (55%) density and relative abundance, but none of the variability in juvenile abundance. Adult snail density was also strongly influenced by distance from the natural/created site transition zone. Juvenile and subadult snail densities were not related to distance from the natural site, possibly due to greater dispersal ability. Between-site differences in C. californica densities and size structure suggested that adult snails were affected by both habitat characteristics and dispersal ability, subadults were influenced to a lesser degree by habitat characteristics, and juveniles were not related to either factor. Accordingly, the influence of habitat characteristics and dispersal ability on created site colonization may change with snail age. Successful restoration of benthic invertebrate communities requires consideration of both habitat characteristics and dispersal ability of the target species, even in created sites in close proximity to natural areas.","10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00358.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332762",NA

Samples were collected from three sites in summer (May 1997) and winter (January 1998) along a transect from an unvegetated Creek Bank through a vegetated Tidal Levee to the vegetated midmarsh with evident lateral heterogeneity caused by hydrologic regime, macrophytes and microbial and macrofaunal activities. A suite of trace metals (As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) was analyzed to obtain their depth-distribution at the three sites. Spatially marked differences were observed, that were primarily related to hydraulic flushing of trace metals away from the sites in high-energy regimes, rapid downward mixing and reworking of sediment via bioturbation, and below-ground degradation and production of Spartina biomass. Although sulfate reduction and the formation of acid volatile sulfide and pyrite were dominant processes throughout the marsh, the trace metal scavenging role of sulfides was not apparent. However, possible sulfurization of organic matter, leading to enhanced trapping of trace metals with organic carbon, may have played an important role in sequestration of trace metals.No similarity was observed visually between the depth trends of trace metals and sediment properties (grain size, iron-oxyhydroxide content, acid volatile sulfides and pyrite content) that are known to play a major role in trace metal partitioning. Only organic carbon content closely followed the trace metal profiles at all the three sites. Minor variation in depth-integrated sediment trace metal content was observed seasonally at each of the three sites. Furthermore, the depth trend of profiles of individual trace metals also did not vary significantly over the seasons either. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms. Our results are helpful to better understand the mechanisms involved in the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on GHG emissions in coastal wetlands.","10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104168","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332774",NA

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

We conducted a field experiment in which we measured ecophysiological properties to explore the response of the ecosystem C stocks to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) in wetlands dominated by native Scirpus mariqueter (Scirpus) and Phragmites australis (Phragmites) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. We measured growing season length, leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), root biomass, net primary production (NPP), litter quality and litter decomposition, plant and soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks in ecosystems dominated by the three species. Our results showed that Spartina had a longer growing season, higher LAI, higher Pn, and greater root biomass than Scirpus and Phragmites. Net primary production (NPP) was 2.16 kg C m(-2) y(-1) in Spartina ecosystems, which was, on average, 1.44 and 0.47 kg C m(-2) y(-1) greater than that in Scirpus and Phragmites ecosystems, respectively. The litter decomposition rate, particularly the belowground decomposition rate, was lower for Spartina than Scirpus and Phragmites due to the lower litter quality of Spartina. The ecosystem C stock (20.94 kg m(-2)) for Spartina was greater than that for Scirpus (17.07 kg m(-2)), Phragmites (19.51 kg m(-2)) and the mudflats (15.12 kg m(-2)).

Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 10, 21, and 30 degrees C, using both flow-through reactors containing intact sediment slices and conventional sediment slurries. At the three sites, and for all depth intervals studied (0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 cm), the dependence of potential SRR on the sulfate concentration followed the Michaelis-Menten rate equation. Apparent sulfate half-saturation concentrations, K-m, measured in the flow-through reactor experiments were comparable at the freshwater and marine sites (0.1-0.3 mM), but somewhat higher at the brackish site (0.4-0.9 mM). Maximum potential SRR, R-max, in the 0-4 cm depth interval of the freshwater sediments were similar to those in the 0-6 cm interval of the marine sediments (1046 nmol cm(-3) h(-1) at 21 degrees C), despite much lower in situ sulfate availability and order- of-magnitude lower densities of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), at the freshwater site. Values of R-max in the brackish sediments were lower (3.7-7.6 nmol cm(-3) h(-1) at 21 degrees C), probably due to less labile organic matter, as inferred from higher C-org/N ratios. Inflow solutions supplemented with lactate enhanced potential SRR at all three sites. Slurry incubations systematically yielded higher R-max values than flow-through reactor experiments for the freshwater and brackish sediments, but similar values for the marine sediments. Transport limitation of potential SRR at the freshwater and brackish sites may be related to the lower sediment porosities and SRB densities compared to the marine site. Multiple rate controls, including sulfate availability, organic matter quality, temperature, and SRB abundance, modulate in situ sulfate-reducing activity along the estuarine salinity gradient.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.","10.1111/rec.13439","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332799","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109387688&doi=10.1111%2frec.13439&partnerID=40&md5=da2889eae978aa7bf1b3dfc16b9a0048"

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332805","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6"

We experimentally manipulated patch-scale (3 * 3 m) cover of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh plants (e.g., Spartina alterniflora, Batis maritima) in fringe and interior locations of ten plots (24 * 42 m) to create a gradient in mangrove cover in coastal Texas, USA. Hurricane Harvey made direct landfall over our site on 25 August 2017. To test how mangrove cover affected carbon retention after the storm, we measured litter breakdown rates (k) of A. germinans and S. alterniflora in surface soils and fast- and slow-decomposing standard litter substrates (green and red tea, respectively) in subsurface soils (15 cm depth). Soil temperatures were lower in mangrove than marsh patches, and prior microclimate measurements showed non-linear increases in air and soil temperatures with increasing mangrove cover (highest temperatures at intermediate % cover). Litter breakdown rates (k) were 2 higher in surface than in subsurface soils. Avicennia germinans litter k increased linearly in surface soils with plot-level mangrove cover, whereas slow-decomposing red tea had similar k in subsurface soils of all plots. Litter k of S. alterniflora in surface soils and fast-decomposing green tea in subsurface soils increased non-linearly with mangrove cover (highest k at intermediate % cover), explained largely by temperature. Microbial respiration rates (R) were highest in interior marsh patches for S. alterniflora litter and increased with plot-level mangrove cover, whereas R associated with A. germinans litter was similar among fringe and interior patches and highest at higher mangrove cover.

Recently, the isotopic (delta C-13) and elemental geochemistry [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratios] of saltmarsh sediments has showed potential for RSL reconstruction. This study presents the results of new delta C-13, TOC and TN measurements obtained on surface sediments of two marshes of the Brittany region (France). Overall, the distribution of delta C-13, TOC, TN and C/N values shows clear dependencies with elevation. Sediments from above and below the high tide level show contrasting TN contents. Clustering analyses identified three elevation-dependent groups, characterized by specific values of delta C-13, TOC and TN. The use of this geochemical reference for RSL reconstruction is tested on a core retrieved from one of the marshes. The sea-level index points obtained plot in good accordance with the microfauna-based RSL positions previously obtained in the region. Some diagenetic losses in TN are observed between modern and Holocene sediments. This does not appear to be harmful to the accuracy of the RSL reconstructions but suggests that C/N ratios may be unreliable palaeoenvironmental proxies in this specific context.

However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer. These field-experimental warming results suggested that in temperate P. australis wetlands without tidal impacts, climate warming might increase the soil organic C pools while exerting no effect on microbial C decomposition, whereas the N and P cycling that is mediated by soil microbes might be enhanced by moderate warming.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.06.010","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332829",NA

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332833","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4"

Several sources of variation can lead to spatial differences in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species including: biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg production and availability within an organism's home range; trophic positions of consumers and MeHg biomagnification efficiency in food webs; and individual prey preferences that influence diet composition. To better understand spatial variation in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species, we evaluated the effects of habitat biogeochemistry, food web structure, and diet composition in the wetland-obligate California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) at three wetlands along the Petaluma River in northern San Francisco Bay, California, USA. The concentration of MeHg in sediments differed significantly among wetlands. We identified three sediment and porewater measurements that contributed significantly to a discriminant function explaining differences in habitat biogeochemistry among wetlands: the porewater concentration of ferrous iron, the percent organic matter, and the sediment MeHg concentration. Food web structure and biomagnification efficiency were similar among wetlands, with trophic magnification factors for MeHg ranging from 1.84 to 2.59. In addition, regurgitation samples indicated that black rails were dietary generalists with similar diets among wetlands (percent similarity indices > 70%). Given the similarities in diet composition, food web structure, and MeHg biomagnification efficiency among wetlands, we concluded that variation in habitat biogeochemistry and associated sediment MeHg production was the primary driver of differences in MeHg concentrations among black rails from different wetlands.

To evaluate variations in meiofaunal communities in estuarine habitats, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of meiofaunal density, distribution and relationships with environmental parameters in a mangrove-dominated ecosystem at Mangawhai, Northern New Zealand, in summer (March) and winter (October), 2013. Five habitat types were studied including mangrove stands, pneumatophore zones, sandflats, mudflats and saltmarshes. In addition, data were recorded for sediment grain size, organic content, and primary benthic productivity (chlorophyll a). Twelve major taxa were identified, with meiofaunal densities ranging between 269 and 8090 ind. 10 cm(-2). Highest abundances were found in fine-grained organic-rich sediments compared to coarse-grained organically poor sediments; the former were generally associated with mangroves stands and pneumatophore zones. Nematodes dominated all observed habitats. Foraminifera ranked second in fine-grained organically rich sediments, whereas copepods ranked second in coarser-grained sediments. Results suggest that meiofaunal taxonomic abundance and distribution are highly sensitive to local physical and biological parameters (e.g. sediment grain size, organic content, benthic primary productivity). The findings revealed that environmental characteristics have an important influence within this temperate estuary.","10.1080/00288330.2020.1865415","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332842","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099394479&doi=10.1080%2f00288330.2020.1865415&partnerID=40&md5=2021ee486c617e8f54dca57a0eb59618"

Short cores were taken from each site from both the high and low marsh and were studied for texture, organic matter, pH, carbonates and geochemistry, including the heavy metals Cu, Pb and Zn. The marsh sediments are free of carbonate bioclasts and quite uniform in texture, consisting of acid to neutral clayey silt in addition to organic matter, which is higher in the top 20 cm.The vertical concentration profiles of heavy metals indicates enrichment in the top 30 cm of the sediment of the high marsh, in contrast with underlying high and low marsh sediment that has concentrations of metals at both studied sites similar to the Average Shale international reference/ continental crust sediments. The geochemical signal of anthropogenic influence in the marsh sediment was determined to have commenced from 1900-1920 using the sedimentation rates derived from Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses. Spatial contrast in contamination levels was found within the estuary, with sediments of the Faralhao marsh showing higher enrichment factors of all metals. The anthropogenic increase of the supply of metal to the Sado estuary resulted from extensive exploitation of pyrite ore in the drainage basin until the 1960's; since that time, the sediments record a break in metal input, which resulted from a decline of the mining industry. However, in the marsh located closer to the industrial area ( Faralhao) this break is followed by a local increase of heavy metal fluxes, which is interpreted as the result of intensification of anthropogenic influence.

Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh.

This is particularly true in urbanized parts of Australia. Approximately 85% of saltmarsh has been lost or severely damaged in the Tuggerah Lakes of the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. Wrack (rotting vegetation) can promote diversity of saltmarshes, by shading soil and reducing physical stress and/or by providing nutrients to nutrient-poor soil. In many parts of the world, wrack derives from the saltmarsh plants. On the shores of the Tuggerah Lakes, large amounts of seagrass wrack (with varying amounts of macro-algae), are stranded along the shoreline and in the remaining saltmarshes. This is perceived to reduce public amenity and have no ecological value. Thus, the local council is under pressure to remove wrack. This experimental study examined the influence of wrack on cover and diversity of saltmarsh and provided preliminary data on changes to organic matter and benthos in the sediment. On average, there was a rapid increase in biomass of the dominant plant, Sarcocornia quinqueflora, in experimental areas where wrack was added, although the response was patchy, but there was no change in diversity over 22 months. There were limited changes to benthos, but no changes to nutrients in the sediment in wracked compared to unwracked treatments. Nevertheless, increased biomass in dominant species may reduce physical stress for other smaller saltmarsh plants. This study is part of a programme examining the interaction between the persistence and growth of saltmarshes and recycling of wrack in the lakes. The ultimate aim is to develop ecologically and economically sound plans of management for an increasingly urbanized area of the NSW coast.","10.1111/j.1442-8903.2004.00207.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332890","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-9644258983&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-8903.2004.00207.x&partnerID=40&md5=2fdbab2a1e9e38a661bf8a64cb8a004f"

Soil hardness and percolation rates were higher outside the crab inhabited area than inside, and soil profiles showed 2 different strata in areas without crabs. Crabs were associated with low soil water content, a higher variability in pH, and a homogeneous distribution of organic matter. Meiofaunal abundance was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. The water content of aboveground structures of S. densiflora was lower inside the crab populated areas. Leaf survival was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. In areas with new shoots (after burning by a brush fire) crabs depleted the aboveground plant structures. A caging experiment showed that crabs decreased leaf survival by herbivory. During the experiment, substrata was covered by sediment displaced by crabs, and the area showed less soil hardness and lower percolation rates than controls. Crabs decreased water content and organic matter on upper sediment layers. Meiofaunal abundance (arachnids and insects) was higher in control plots (without crabs) than in treatment plots. A field selection experiment showed that crabs decreased survival of young stems, but did not affect old stems. All this evidence suggests that C, granulata affects cordgrass production by herbivory on new shoots, and can change the physical characteristics of the environment, which may also indirectly affect S. densiflora production.

Significant damage is defined as that level of degradation of the environment beyond which the system will not be able to return to its former healthy state. We inventoried plant species distribution in the marsh, determined some characteristics of the soils, and measured water salinity. We found many more species of plants in the marshes of the Suwannee delta than is common in tidal marshes distant from fresh water. Some of these plants are highly salt tolerant such as Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene (saltgrass) and Juncus roemerianus Scheele (needlerush). Some have less salt tolerance i.e. Sagittaria lancifolia L. (arrowhead) and Scirpus americanus Pers. (three-square). The soils are high organic mineral soils or organic soils (> 30% organic matter), anoxic, and contain high amounts of sulfur. Soil salinity, measured by electrical conductivity (EC) is higher near the Gulf and decreases as one goes upriver. There is little significant correlation between soil EC and the distribution of most plants. Although saltgrass and needlerush are very common in the areas of highest EC, the generally low salinity levels permit the growth of a variety of plants. Another phenomenon resulting in erratic distribution of plants is wrack, plant debris deposited by storms over existing vegetation, resulting in the death of the original plants and the invasion or expansion by opportunistic species. Low rainfall and low river flow in June, 2000 resulted in an increase in soil water EC of 17% to 142% and damage to several plant species in the Delta.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332916",NA

To assess the effect of groundwater discharge on marsh nitrogen cycling, we measured N-cycling in sediments from a fringing mesohaline marsh in Virginia which receives a seasonal groundwater input. Mineralization, nitrification, potential denitrification (DNF), and potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates were estimated along with porewater concentrations of oxygen, sulfide, and conductivity during high (May 1997) and low (October 1997) groundwater discharge. All N-cycling processes were confined to the upper 1 to 1.5 m of marsh, where organic matter and ammonium were most abundant. Depth-integrated rates for mineralization, nitrification, DNRA, and DNF ranged between 1.0-11.2, 0.0-2.2, 0.9-6.1, and 1.8-17.6 mmol N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. During spring discharge (May), porewater conductivity, and dissolved sulfide decreased by approximately 50%, and a groundwater-driven O-2 flux of 27 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) into the marsh subsurface was estimated, Although mineralization, nitrification, and DNRA rates were up to 12x, 6x, and 7.5x greater in May. respectively, than during low discharge (October), DNF was 10x higher in October. The largest difference in seasonal rates was observed nearest the upland border, where groundwater discharge had the greatest effect on sediment geochemistry. We suggest that a synergy between an increased flux of electron accepters, porewater mixing, and flushing of salt and sulfide was responsible for the elevated mineralization and nitrification rates in May. Natural-abundance delta N-15 measurements of the NH4+, NO3-, and N-2 pools showed that nitrification is important in mediating N export by linking mineralization and denitrification in this marsh. However, despite accelerated mineralization and nitrification in May, there was not an equivalently large export of N via coupled nitrification-denitrification. The DNF:DNRA ratio in May (0.6) was 25-fold lower than that seen at low discharge, indicating that during spring discharge, a greater proportion of nitrified N was recycled internally rather than exported via denitrification.","10.3354/meps210025","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332933",NA

The results indicate the following: (1) Soil factors varied significantly with different settlement ages of S. alterniflora that expanded toward the land and sea. Soil bulk density decreased with settlement age and was lowest for growth period IV (10 - 16 year old sites) whereas an opposite trend was shown for soil moisture. Soil salinity and soil nutrients were highest for growth period III (6 - 10 year old sites) (2) Principal component analysis demonstrated that soil bulk density, moisture and salinity are the main soil factors that drive landscape evolution in S. alterniflora marshes. (3) There was a significant positive correlation between S. alterniflora biomass and the organic matter and bulk density of soil (p < 0.05). Results showed that the invasion and settlement of S. alterniflora in the coastal wetland of Yancheng are changing the physical and chemical properties of the coastal wetland soil.

Leptuca uruguayensis is a fiddler crab that breeds year round in tropical estuaries but only in summer months in temperate salt marshes. In this study, we examined several reproductive attributes of the southernmost population of L. uruguayensis, including the proportion of ovigerous females, the proportion of surface-active crabs, the developmental status of the gonads and hepatopancreas, and the fullness of seminal receptacles, and related them to environmental factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and sediment organic matter content. We found that temperature was the environmental factor that was most correlated with the reproductive process of the southernmost fiddler crab, since this environmental factor was related to ovarian development, to the fullness of seminal receptacles, and to the hepatosomatic index. At the southern edge of its distribution, the low temperatures of winter restricted reproduction in L. uruguayensis.

The total organic carbon, stable carbon isotope, total nitrogen, lignin phenols in suspended particulate matter, and three sediment cores collected from the Changjiang LDE were analyzed to study the effects of river damming and delta erosion on the redistribution and burial of organic carbon (OC) in the coastal margin. The OC budgets that include the delta erosion process were established to better constrain the burial fluxes of OC in the Changjiang River system before and after river damming. We used a three-end-member mixing model with Monte Carlo simulation and found that the ratio of deltaic OC to riverine OC significantly increased in estuarine SPM and sediment cores in the Changjiang LDE after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), reflective of reduced sediment load and enhanced delta erosion. Our budget showed that, compared with the pre-dam period (1953-1985), the burial of terrestrial OC in the Changjiang LDE sediments had been reduced by similar to 97.3%, on the basis of 72.7% and 82.7% reductions in sediment load and particulate OC flux, respectively. Although trapping of terrestrial OC in reservoirs is the key driver in these reductions, re exposure and decomposition of OC from eroding delta sediments also contribute significantly to OC losses in coastal sediments. On the contrary, the ratio of marine OC to riverine OC increased in sediment cores after TGD building, due in part to more inputs of marine OC because of serious eutrophication in recent decades. As continued dam construction and sea-level rise change the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon sequestration in the coastal zones of LDEs, further consideration of alterations in these carbon burial ""hotspots"" is needed in global carbon models.

Moisture, organic matter, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, carbohydrates (CH), proteins (PRT), and abundance and structure of microphytobenthic community were evaluated in surface sediments. Higher moisture was observed at S2 and was related to the proximity of this site to the subtidal zone and the effect of the environmental variables temperature and rain. No significant differences were found in organic matter content between sites; however, at S1, a higher concentration was registered during winter and early spring associated to the period of higher microphytobenthic biomass. Chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were higher at S1, attributed to the higher microphytobenthos abundance at this site. Differences in microphytobenthos were observed not only in quantity but also in community structure since at S1 filamentous cyanobacteria dominated the community, whereas at S2, higher abundance of centric diatoms and the absence of cyanobacteria were observed during most of the study. S1 showed higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates which could be attributed to the higher production of fresh organic matter by microphytobenthos.

Intertidal biostabilization has been well studied in temperate and subtropical environments, but little is known for subarctic conditions with strong seasonal changes in vegetation cover and sea ice presence in winter because of the difficulty in studying the sediments under ice cover. The present project investigated the role of biofilms and their seasonal as well as spatial variations for sediment biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal area near Rimouski (Quebec, Canada). Grain size distribution reflected a seaward increasing trend in sand content and mean grain size. The poor sorting of sediments results from the contribution of sediment transport by ice rafting in addition to the hydrodynamic transport processes in this subarctic intertidal area. A Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) was used to measure the erosion threshold (tau(crit)) across the entire intertidal area. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and extra polymeric substances (EPS) were measured in the top 3 mm. The high marsh had a far higher tau(crit) than the low marsh, but there was much less variation between low marsh, mudflat and sandflat. tau(crit )was significantly correlated with Chl a, elevation, and organic matter content. EPS was not a good indicator for tau(crit), except for the low marsh/high marsh difference. The results showed a seasonal cycle in intertidal bed emdibility. Lower intertidal areas had highest tau(crit) in autumn during the storm season, followed by lowest tau(crit) in winter under sea-ice cover, and no major difference between summer and spring. This study highlights the characteristics of cold climate intertidal areas, where low temperatures in autumn and land-fast ice cover during winter severely affect biofilms and intertidal vegetation, and ultimately their capacity to shield sediments from erosion.","10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106935","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332962","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090549253&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106935&partnerID=40&md5=b28fe22f40bd05e63fd6a1389976dc91"

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.","10.3390/ijerph16112043","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332968",NA

This study explores the Hemudu people's survival strategy using sedimentological and chronological records, and organic and acetic-acid-leachable alkaline-earth (Ca, Sr, and Ba) chemistry on a well-dated profile from the coastal Wuguishan site in the Ningbo Plain. Analyses of alkaline-earth elements in surficial sediments collected from present-day alluvial plain, tidal river, and saltmarsh/tidal flat environments in the Ningbo Plain were also undertaken to explain sedimentary environmental changes and their linkage to Hemudu activity at the Wuguishan site. Results indicate high sediment acetic-acid-leachable Ca and Sr contents with high Sr/Ba ratios, and high sediment total inorganic carbon contents at the site during 6300-6000 cal. year BP, which coincided with a marine incursion at the nearby Neolithic Yushan site. However, the increasing sediment total organic carbon contents and decreasing delta C-13 values suggest that the Wuguishan site evolved from an upper tidal flat to a saltmarsh environment, attracting settlement by the prehistoric Hemudu people after similar to 6200 cal. year BP. Sr and Ca contents and Sr/Ba ratios decreased after similar to 6000 cal. year BP, indicating that the site developed into a low-salinity marsh in the supratidal environment after rapid accumulation caused by a storm event at similar to 6020 cal. year BP. Furthermore, the high Sr and Ba contents in the layers of Hemudu Culture Period III indicate the Hemudu people's consumption of seafood and their adaption strategy for living in the vulnerable coastal wetland.","10.1177/0959683620941070","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332974","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087984573&doi=10.1177%2f0959683620941070&partnerID=40&md5=49483f4d229f497494f6f81f82b94700"

Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02582.x","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14332977","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857137924&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2486.2011.02582.x&partnerID=40&md5=cfd1e9fdd645bf9256f6b61fc8bb3138"

Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption.

Traditional techniques for quantifying macrofaunal communities were combined with emerging stable isotopic approaches for evaluation of trophic recovery, making comparisons with a nearby natural Spartina foliosa habitat. Life history-based predictions successfully identified major colonization modes, although most taxa employed a variety of tactics for colonizing the restored marsh. The presence of S.foliosa did not seem to affect macrofaunal colonization or succession at the scale of this study. However, soil organic matter content in the restored marsh was positively correlated with insect densities, and high initial salinities may have limited the success of early colonists. Total macrofaunal densities recovered to natural marsh levels after 14 months and diversity, measured as species richness and the Shannon index (H'), was comparable to the natural marsh by 19 months. Some compositional disparities between the natural and created communities persisted after 19 months, including lower percentages of surface-feeding polychaetes (Polydora spp.) and higher percentages of dipteran insects and turbellarians in the Friendship marsh. As surficial structural similarity of infaunal communities between the Friendship and natural habitat was achieved, isotopic analyses revealed a simultaneous trajectory towards recovery of trophic structure. Enriched delta(13)C signatures of benthic microalgae and infauna, observed in the restored marsh shortly after establishment compared to natural Spartina habitat, recovered after 19 months. However, the depletion in delta(15)N signatures of macrofauna in the Friendship marsh indicated consumption of microalgae, particularly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, while macroalgae and Spartina made a larger contribution to macrofaunal diets in the natural habitat.

The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise (ESLR) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, TX. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1 -2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. Pb-210 and Cs-137 accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed pH over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we measured CH4 production potential, methanogen community structure and biogeochemical factors along a coastal wetland transect comprised of five habitat regions: open water, bare tidal flat, invasive S. alterniflora marsh and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis marshes. CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively. S. alterniflora invasion elevated concentration of non-competitive trimethylamine, and shifted methanogen community from acetotrophic to facultative methanogens, which together facilitated increased CH4 production potential.","10.1038/srep18777","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953238219&doi=10.1038%2fsrep18777&partnerID=40&md5=ccffa77a5b3b4f8791e4bf91261837eb"

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, shellfish reefs contain significant pools of carbon and are globally endangered, yet considerable uncertainty remains regarding shellfish reefs' role as sources (+) or sinks () of atmospheric CO2. While CO2 release is a by-product of carbonate shell production (then burial), shellfish also facilitate atmospheric-CO2 drawdown via filtration and rapid biodeposition of carbon-fixing primary producers. We provide a framework to account for the dual burial of inorganic and organic carbon, and demonstrate that decade-old experimental reefs on intertidal sandflats were net sources of CO2 (7.1 1.2 MgC ha1 yr1 ( s.e.)) resulting from predominantly carbonate deposition, whereas shallow subtidal reefs (1.0 0.4 MgC ha1 yr1) and saltmarsh-fringing reefs (1.3 0.4 MgC ha1 yr1) were dominated by organic-carbon-rich sediments and functioned as net carbon sinks (on par with vegetated coastal habitats). These landscape-level differences reflect gradients in shellfish growth, survivorship and shell bioerosion. Notably, down-core carbon concentrations in 100- to 4000-year-old reefs mirrored experimental-reef data, suggesting our results are relevant over centennial to millennial scales, although we note that these natural reefs appeared to function as slight carbon sources (0.5 0.3 MgC ha1 yr1). Globally, the historical mining of the top metre of shellfish reefs may have reintroduced more than 400 000 000 Mg of organic carbon into estuaries. Importantly, reef formation and destruction do not have reciprocal, counterbalancing impacts on atmospheric CO2 since excavated organic material may be remineralized while shell may experience continued preservation through reburial. Thus, protection of existing reefs could be considered as one component of climate mitigation programmes focused on the coastal zone. reef_carbon_sequestration_publication 20170425all raw data and calculations Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333016",NA

Sample locations were chosen based on a gradient of the primary contaminants of concern, total mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), primarily Aroclor 1268. Sediment concentrations of Aroclor 1268 ranged from 2.3 to 150 mg/kg dry weight, while mercury concentrations ranged from 15 to 170 mg/kg dry weight in the study area. Mercury and PCBs were determined to be co-located in the sediments. Total organic carbon composition of the sediments was negatively associated with PCB and mercury concentrations. A total of 29 benthic taxa was identified in 49 samples; replicate samples were taken at each of five sampling locations. Mean infaunal density across all sampling locations was estimated at approximately 61,000 to 234,000 organisms m(-2) Overall, polychaetes comprised 57% of the infaunal community with Manayunkia aestuarina as the dominant species. Oligochaetes, nematodes, crustacea, insects, and gastropods comprised 23.0, 18.0, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.2% of the overall benthic community, respectively Density estimates of individual species between sampling locations showed no consistent patterns in response to pollutants. However, an analysis of higher taxonomic levels revealed some general trends. In uncontaminated areas, the benthic community was dominated by nematodes and oligochaetes, whereas moderate to highly contaminated areas were dominated by polychaetes and a smaller percentage of oligochaetes and nematodes. A trophic analysis of the same data set revealed that the community shifted from an evenly distributed percentage of surface and subsurface feeders in the uncontaminated areas to a community dominated by surface feeders in the more contaminated locations. Carnivores comprised from 0.13 to 0.90% of the trophic structure, with the percentage of carnivores generally decreasing with increasing contamination. Mercury and PCBs were bioaccumulating in representative marsh benthic invertebrates, presenting a potential source of contaminants to marsh consumers. Tissue PCB and tissue mercury concentrations were positively related to sediment PCB and mercury concentrations, respectively. A standard 14-day toxicity test using the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus showed no acute toxicity across the sampling locations.","10.1007/s002449900520","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333031","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032871910&doi=10.1007%2fs002449900520&partnerID=40&md5=52f7264bf8410cecea9272b5b5610e48"

Bacterial cell-size distributions were also significantly different between the seaside and bayside creeks, with a larger proportion of smaller cells dominating samples from the seaside creeks. Bayside and seaside concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were similar (approximately 49 mg l-1 TSS and 3.5 mg l-1 DOC). The amount of organic matter (OM) and chlorophyll a was higher in the bayside creeks, while inorganic N and P concentrations were higher in the seaside creeks (OM: 9.0 and 3.4 mg l-1; chlorophyll a: 6.0 and 4.1 g l-1; PO43-: 0.2 and 1.2 muM; NH4+: 0.6 and 1.2 muM; bayside and seaside respectively). The high inorganic nutrient pools combined with the low levels of bacterial productivity suggest that bacterial production is not limited by N or P in the seaside creeks and that the amount of carbon moving through the bacterial loop is much less than on the bayside. In fact, DOC turnover times were much longer for the seaside (22 d) than for the bayside (6 d). Reasons for the observed differences in bacterial dynamics for the bay and seasides are not known specifically, but may be related to differences in the source of the DOC (marsh grass vs phytoplankton), grazing on the bacterial cells, or bacterial community structure.","10.3354/meps086111","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333038","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027073497&doi=10.3354%2fmeps086111&partnerID=40&md5=5786ad063cd6aaef1a65c9cecd37e8bf"

Sediment properties and macroinfaunal community structure were compared in patches invaded by Spartina hybrid and adjacent uninvaded patches at 3 sites in San Francisco Bay (2 tidal flats and 1 Salicornia marsh). We hypothesized that (1) sediments vegetated by Spartina hybrid would have reduced sediment grain size, higher organic matter content, lower redox potential, lower salinity and reduced microalgal biomass relative to adjacent unvegetated tidal flat sediments, and (2) that differences in the sediment environment would correspond to changes in the infaunal invertebrate community structure and feeding modes. We observed 75 % lower total macro-faunal density and lower species richness in Spartina-vegetated sediments at Elsie Roemer (30 yr old invasion) than in an adjacent unvegetated tidal flat. This was due to lower densities of surface-feeding amphipods, bivalves, cirratulid and spionid polychaetes. The proportional representation of subsurface-deposit feeders was greater in Spartina patches than in unvegetated sediments. At a more recently invaded site (Roberts Landing; 15 yr invasion), Spartina patches differed from tidal flat sediments in composition, but not in abundance. Native (Salicornia) and Spartina patches exhibited similar sediment properties at San Mateo, where the Spartina hybrid invaded 8 to 10 yr earlier. No differences were detected in densities or proportions of surface- or subsurface-deposit feeders, but the proportion of carnivores/omnivores and grazers increased in the hybrid-invaded patches.

The number of habitats on each island was counted. There was a positive correlation between island area and number of habitat types. Island area was significantly positively correlated with various measures of floristic diversity, including the total number of species present, and the numbers of annual, herbaceous, and shrublet species. Perennial and shrub species numbers did not differ significantly with island area. In addition to island area, elevation and soil salinity, as well as distance to the Mediterranean Sea, all contributed significantly to variation in species composition in the terrestrial habitats. Water salinity and transparency accounted for 69% of the variation in aquatic species numbers. There was a weak effect of isolation on similarity of species composition on islands. Eight vegetation types, represented by 13 indicator species identified after TWINSPAN analysis, were distinguished by soil characteristics.

On many sites, restoration of ecological attributes such as secondary production, habitat/species diversity, and wetland soil characteristics do not occur within the first decade, and no long-term studies exist to document the length of time required to achieve complete restoration of wetland dependent functions and values. Characteristics of community structure (macrophyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15-25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12-24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7-12 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) than in natural marshes (2-5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems. Different ecological attributes develop at different rates, with primary producers achieving equivalence during the first 5 yr, followed by the benthic infauna community 5-10 yr later.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

The study was conducted in four localities of southern Santa Cruz (Argentina): Bahia San Julian (49 degrees 18'S, 67 degrees 41'W) and the lower reaches of the estuaries of Rio Santa Cruz (50 degrees 05'S, 68 degrees 29'W), Rio Coyle (50 degrees 58'S, 69 degrees 16'W) and Rio Gallegos (51 degrees 37'S, 69 degrees 02'W). Surveys were performed in spring 2015 and summer 2016 at the upper, middle and lower intertidal levels. Four sediment samples were collected per intertidal level at each locality in each sampling period with a corer (0.00785 m(2)) up to 20 cm in depth. The organisms were separated using a 0.5 mm mesh sieve for subsequent identification and quantification. To explore possible spatial variations in the community, environmental and abundance data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Intertidal level, substrate grain size and organic matter content were determinant factors of distribution of benthic assemblages. The Darina solenoides-Scolecolepides uncinatus-Eteone sculpta assemblage was characteristic of sand-mud substrates with dominance of silt-clay and greatest organic matter content of upper and middle intertidal. The D. solenoides-Ampelisca sp. assemblage was characteristic of the lower intertidal, with dominance of fine sand. The presence of saltmarshes was also a factor determining benthic assemblages at the upper intertidal of the estuarine localities. This work provides useful information to implement adequate management actions to protect the lower reaches of the Rio Santa Cruz estuary.","10.1007/s41208-019-00133-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333100","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073069915&doi=10.1007%2fs41208-019-00133-7&partnerID=40&md5=72857df62721938eaae758321ec1a5cf"

Field analysis of sediment gouge cores established discrete lithostratigraphic units extend across the wetland. Detailed sediment analyses reveal abrupt changes in lithology, percent total organic matter, grain size, and magnetic susceptibility. Microfossil analyses indicate that predominantly freshwater deposits bury relic intertidal deposits at three distinct depths. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the three burial events occurred in the last 2000 calendar years. Two of the three events are contemporaneous with large-magnitude paleoearthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon fault system. From these data, we infer that during large magnitude earthquakes a step-over along the fault zone results in the vertical displacement of an approximately 5-km(2) area that is consistent with the footprint of an estuary identified in pre-development maps. These findings provide insight on the evolution of the saltmarsh, coseismic deformation and earthquake recurrence in a wide area of southern California, and sensitive habitat already threatened by eustatic sea level rise.","10.1038/srep44615","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333106","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015979583&doi=10.1038%2fsrep44615&partnerID=40&md5=a235e6d5c94fd5a9c96bd9ce264eb511"

The island marsh lost 7.2% of its area in 8 years by overwash. The lagoon marsh lost 10.6% of its area over 41 years by recession of marsh edges. The mainland marsh area increased by 8.2% over 50 years, primarily by upland encroachment. Surface sediment was collected monthly at the mainland and lagoon marshes for 1 year to identify changes in the mean grain size, organic content and mass of sediment deposited on sampling plates. Short-term variability in these characteristics obscured seasonal differences. Grain size and monthly sediment accumulation decreased towards the interior of both marshes, while the organic matter content increased. On the lagoon marsh, coarse sediment at creekside stations, as well as grain size contrasts between surface and subsurface sediment, are consistent with erosion evident in GIS analysis. On the mainland marsh, sediment does not vary as much with location or depth, and topography appears stable. Tidal currents appear to be competent to resuspend most particle sizes represented in surface sediment samples, including aggregates, except at the edge of the lagoon site. Decreasing rates of marsh edge change reflect moderation of oceanic processes, while the interior of both lagoon and mainland marshes remained stable throughout the study. Both lagoon marsh losses to recession and mainland marsh gains from upland reflect the submergence which this shoreline experiences.

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

Principal components analysis and Pearson product moment correlation analyses were used to examine the relationships between ten land cover categories and selected measures of nutrient or bacterial enrichment in the water column and contaminant enrichment in sediments. These analyses indicated strong relationships between land cover categories representing upland development and a composite measure of 24 inorganic and organic contaminants using the Effect Range Median-Quotient (ERM-Q). Similar relationships also were observed for the summed concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, and metals. Data obtained from tidal creeks generally showed stronger correlations between urban/ suburban land use and pesticides and metals compared to data obtained from larger open water habitats. Correlations between PAH concentrations and the urban/suburban land cover categories were similar between creek and open water habitats. PCB concentrations generally showed very little relationship to any of the land cover categories. Measures of nutrient enrichment, which included total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate-nitrite, phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, and total organic carbon, were generally not significantly correlated with any land cover categories, whereas fecal coliform bacteria were significantly and positively correlated with the urban/suburban land cover categories and negatively correlated with the non-urban land cover categories. Fecal coliform correlations were stronger using data from the open water sites than from the tidal creek sites. Both ERM-Q and fecal coliform concentrations were much greater and more pervasive in watersheds with relatively high (> 50%) urban/suburban cover compared to watersheds with low (< 30%) urban/suburban cover. These analyses support the hypotheses that estuarine habitat quality reflects upland development patterns at large spatial scales, and that upland urbanization can result in increased risk of biological degradation and reduced safe human use of South Carolina's coastal resources.

M.","2013","Carbon sequestration and biogeochemical cycling in a saltmarsh Subject to coastal managed realignment","Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of C-14-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).

Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

These intertidal soils of India are dominated with Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides, and Suaeda maritima halophytes, which play a significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and improving microenvironment. However, the relative contribution of edaphic factors, halophytes, rhizosphere, and bulk sediments on microbial community composition is poorly understood in the intertidal sediments. Here, we sampled rhizosphere and bulk sediments of three dominant halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus, and Suaeda) from five geographical locations of intertidal region of Gujarat, India. Sediment microbial community structure was characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Microbial biomass was significantly influenced by the pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, and sodium and potassium concentrations. Multivariate analysis of PLFA profiles had significantly separated the sediment microbial community composition of regional sampling sites, halophytes, rhizosphere, and bulk sediments. Sediments from Suaeda plants were characterized by higher abundance of PLFA biomarkers of Gram-negative, total bacteria, and actinomycetes than other halophytes. Significantly highest abundance of Gram-positive and fungal PLFAs was observed in sediments of Aeluropus and Salicornia, respectively than in those of Suaeda. The rhizospheric sediment had significantly higher abundance of Gram-negative and fungal PLFAs biomarkers compared to bulk sediment. The results of the present study contribute to our understanding of the relative importance of different edaphic and spatial factors and halophyte vegetation on sediment microbial community of intertidal sediments of coastal ecosystem.","10.1080/15226514.2016.1244168","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333169",NA

During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period.

Spatial patterns in sediment contamination were governed by the high affinity of Hg for total organic carbon (TOC). Sediment MeHg and percent MeHg were also inversely related to summer bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, presumably due to the increased activity of methylating bacteria. For biota, Hg accumulation was influenced by inter-specific habitat preferences and trophic structure, and sediments with high TOC and percent silt-clay composition limited mercury bioavailability. Moreover, hypoxic bottom water limited Hg bioaccumulation, which is possibly mediated by a reduction in biotic foraging, and thus, dietary uptake of mercury. Finally, most biota demonstrated a significant positive relationship between tissue and TOC-normalized sediment Hg, but relationships were much weaker or absent for sediment MeHg. These results have important implications for the utility of estuarine biota as subjects for mercury monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Variations of the environmental parameters strongly influence the structure of the macrobenthic communities in the marshes and since macrobenthos is the most important food item for marsh-visiting fish species in the Schelde, the variation in food resources can have a strong effect on the higher trophic level. The present study deals with the variation in macrobenthic communities in different habitats of intertidal marshes along the salinity gradient and the differences between the marsh creeks and the intertidal part of the estuary. The study measured density and species richness together with the biomass, and sampled a large intertidal channel and a smaller creek within five marshes along the salinity gradient of the Schelde estuary every six weeks between May and October in 2000.The small creeks had a smaller grain size and higher organic matter content than those in the large channel although the differences in the environmental parameters did not explain the different communities in the two habitats. Marshes had distinct macrobenthic communities but the abundance of macrofauna fluctuated along the estuary without an identifiable spatial trend. In contrast, the total biomass increased towards the euhaline area due to the domination of Nereis diversicolor. Diversity showed a significant positive correlation with the salinity.Comparison of the macrofaunal communities in the marsh with those on the intertidal flats of the estuary indicated similar trends in density, biomass and diversity along the salinity gradient. The density was similar in both habitats whereas biomass was much higher in the intertidal habitats of the estuary, partly due to the higher biomass of molluscs and annelids. Diversity indices were higher in the marsh, and the freshwater area had more species than in the estuary. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

Hurricane Katrina altered elevation dynamics of two subsiding brackish marshes in the Mississippi River deltaic plain by adding I to 8 cm of sediment to the soil surface in August 2005. Soil elevations at both Sites subsequently declined due to continued Subsidence, but net elevation gain was Still positive at both Pearl River (+1.7 cm) and Big Branch (+0.7 cm) marshes two years after the hurricane.

This study investigated and characterised CASS and sulfidic material at four sites (wetland (WE), swamp scrub (SS), woodland (WO) and coastal tussock saltmarsh (CTS)) on the estuarine floodplain of the Anglesea River in southern Australia. Shell material and seawater buffered acidity generated and provided acid-neutralising capacity (up to 10.65% CaCO3-equivalent) at the sites located on the lower estuarine floodplain (WO and CTS). The SS site, located on the upper estuarine floodplain, can potentially acidify soil and water due to high positive net acidity (>200 molH(+)t(-1)) and a limited acid-neutralising capacity. High titratable actual acidity in the SS and WO profiles (>270 molH(+)t(-1)) were the result of high organic matter in peat-like layers that can potentially contribute organic acids in addition to acidity formed from oxidation of sulfidic sediments. The results of the present study suggest that the environments and chemistry of acid sulfate soils in southern Australia are distinct from those located in eastern Australia; this may be related to differences in estuarine processes that affect formation of acid sulfate soils, as well as the geomorphology and geology of the catchment.","10.1071/SR15174","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333186","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991515564&doi=10.1071%2fSR15174&partnerID=40&md5=64cb3716a7d057308d41ba75c9aab997"

A.; Turchetto, M.; Miserocchi, S.; Boldrin, A.","2008","Source and composition of organic matter in the Bari canyon (Italy): Dense water cascading versus particulate export from the upper ocean","Recent studies in the southern Adriatic Sea have shown that dense water cascading is an effective off-shelf transport mechanism. In order to evaluate the relative importance of different processes affecting the down-slope transfer of organic matter (OM), a multi-proxy biogeochemical study was carried out in the southern Adriatic. Three sediment traps were deployed on the southern slope in March 2004 for 1 year at 35 m above the seabed. Surficial sediments were collected on the shelf and slope along a shore-normal transect. Suspended material in the water column at different water depths was collected along nine shore-normal transects. Organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) and CuO reaction products were used to identify the OM sources and to asses the relative importance of vertical and lateral particulate fluxes. Both sinking particulates from the euphotic zone and advected material from the seafloor were collected by the moored instrumentations. During low-mass fluxes, the trapped material exhibited the highest Delta C-14 values (from -162.0 parts per thousand to +42.3 parts per thousand) and OC contents (from 1.13% to 2.17%) while the lignin displayed the lowest content (from 0.160 to 0.285 mg 100 mg(-1) OC). However, during dense water cascading events, the down-slope particulate flux showed different compositional features. In this period the trapped material displayed the most depleted Delta C-14 values (from -275.3 parts per thousand to -171.3 parts per thousand.), the lowest OC content (from 0.87% to 1.31%), and the highest lignin content (from 0.230 to 379 mg 100 mg(-1) OC). Holocene sea-level rise has drastically reduced sediment availability to the Bari canyon, and this in turn has affected the OC composition of the material funneled toward the deep Adriatic Sea. Parameters based on lignin CuO products suggest that the terrestrial material exported down the slope is very different from riverine inputs and inner shelf sediments. This indicates that neither river floods nor sediment resuspension from the inner shelf contributes directly to the down-slope flux. Rather, the material collected in the sediment traps exhibits an OM composition comparable to the surface sediments collected in the southern outer shelf. This correspondence suggests that resuspension of sediments by bottom currents in the southern outer shelf significantly contribute to down-slope OM transfer. Finally, the presence of lignin phenols in all cups indicates that lateral fluxes were constantly active on the slope throughout the deployment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediments were collected from McGuill Lake, a small freshwater lake, and two salt marsh sites in Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, and size-fractioned by wet sieving. Physical forcing or energy, indicated by tides, tidal current, and wind and wind fetch area, is weakest in the lake, intermediate strength at the Nueces Delta, and strongest at Copano Bay. Results from total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) and n-alkane analysis, and C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) showed that the SOM from all three sites became more degraded towards finer size fractions, from > 300 mu m, 300-125 mu m, 125-63 mu m, 63-32 mu m to < 32 mu m. Relative to the coarse fractions, the fine fractions were enriched in the degradation indicator gamma-aminobutyric acid, and in aliphatic and proteinaceous components, as shown from NMR spectra and lower C/N ratio values. This degradation pattern of SOM with size is typical for sediments from coastal and lacustrine environments. However, the contents of organic carbon (OC), THAAs and n-alkanes were higher in sandy fractions than in silt and clay fractions from McGuill Lake sediment, suggesting that the SOM was relatively undegraded in coarse fractions. The size distribution of OM in the lake could be explained by the weak physical forcing, which may not easily break down coarser plant detritus into smaller pieces. The trend contrasted with degradation patterns for sediments from Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, where SOM was concentrated in the < 32 mu m fraction, which may be due to the strong physical forcing. The physical forcing effects could also explain the attachment of clay minerals to sand grains in both the lake and Nueces Delta because of the relatively weak physical forcing effects, while no clay attachment to sand grains was found at the Copano Bay site because of the strong physical forcing effects. Physical forcing may be an important mechanism in the processing and transport of OM from vascular plants and other organic sources in estuaries and bays before the SOM is exported to coastal oceans.

However, alteration in nutrient levels caused by invasion of non-native plant species is poorly understood, and the effects of invasive plants on sediment nutrients found in previous studies are contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that an exotic plant species invasion will change the chemical characteristics of an ecosystem over time. To test this hypothesis, the spatial distribution of S. alternifiora in 2006, 2010 and 2014 was analyzed by aerial images, Google Earth satellite images and field investigations. Furthermore, according to the space time reciprocal principle, a primary field survey with three locations (S1, S2 and S4) was conducted in 2014, and sediment nutrient levels, including total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alternifiora. We also investigated six locations (S1 S6) in 2016 in the same manner to compare the changes in sediment nutrients between the two years. The area infested with S. alternifiora increased from 10.8 ha in 2006, to 26.2 ha in 2010, and 37.5 ha in 2014, with a 35.6% annual expansion rate between 2006 and 2010, and a 10.8% annual expansion rate between 2010 and 2014, respectively. Considering the two field survey results, we found that S. alternifiora invasion increased sediment nutrient levels in the early-term (i.e., S1-S4 period, approximately 10 years), and then significantly decreased TC, TN and TP content to levels even lower than bare beach. Analyses of stoichiometry characteristics of the sediment nutrients also verified these two apparent stages. The results showed that early-term invasion of S. alternifiora and subsequent invasion alter sediment nutrients differently, and these results may explain the seemingly contradictory increases and decreases in nutrient levels reported in previous studies. Our results provide important information that furthers our understanding of the impact of S. alterniflora invasion.","10.1016/j.catena.2019.04.016","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333222",NA

Dominant halophytes such as Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides and Suaeda maritima play significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient mineralization, nutrient cycling and improving micro-environment. There are scanty reports on the rhizosphere microbial communities of halophytes. Whether the rhizosphere of halophytes harbors unique microbial communities or has species specificity is yet to be established. In the present study, we have determined microbial community structure and functional genes abundance as well as major nutrients and three key enzyme activities in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of three halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus and Suaeda) growing on salty marsh of coastal Gujarat, India. The NH4-N and available K were significantly higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil in all the cases. The rhizosphere of Suaeda was characterized by significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon, total N, NH4-N and available P as compared to other two halophytes. The rhizopsheric soil had significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve and total bacterial PLFA biomarkers compared to the bulk soil. Among halophytes, significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs were recorded in Suaeda and Aeluropus in comparison to Salicornia. The NMS analysis of PLFA profiles revealed a significant difference in microbial community structure in Salicornia compared to Aeluropus and Suaeda. Similarly, rhizosphere microbial community structure of Salicornia was significantly different from Suaeda and Aeluropus. In rhizosphere soils, significantly higher abundance (molar%) of GM-ve, GM +ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs were observed in Aeluropus and Suaeda compared to Salicornia. Activities of beta-glucosidase and urease were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. The abundance of 16S rRNA, cbbL and nifH genes, detected by the quantitative RT-PCR was significantly varied among soils and halophytes. The results exhibited high bacterial diversity, abundance of CO2 and N-fixing bacteria, which can be explored further for their role in C and N cycling for sustainable agriculture and environment management.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of potential interactive effects between plant traits and tidal disturbances in regulating biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon sequestration, in coastal saltmarsh systems.","10.1002/ecs2.2642","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333239","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080983518&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2642&partnerID=40&md5=e9c2726d6dbd6cd5b6a0aecda5bc7c82"

Formation of iron sulfides in the Odiel River estuary is produced under different crystallization habits in the various subenvironments. There are: (1) octahedral bipyramidal crystals, (2) concentrated crystals in the tests of foraminifers, and (3) framboidal aggregates. Sediments display higher organic carbon/sulfur ratios in the subtidal channel subenvironment than in the intertidal channel-margin sectors. This is because the channel is always submerged under water, thereby producing the sulfur available for bacterial activity. In contrast, the channel-margin sectors are only periodically submerged. Sediments of the salt marsh sectors show C/S ratio values near to those observed in fresh-water environments, since the organic carbon content is highest with only minor sulfur content because the flood water enters it only periodically. The sterile marsh sectors show a higher C/S ratio than those from the marine environments because they are reached only by astronomic tides, occurring every 60 or 183 days. The water introduced there remains for a sufficient time to allow for the sulfur to be completely comsumed.

Sediment was incubated in jars (20-ml glass vials) and changes in porewater solutes were followed in a time series of 3 weeks. Furthermore, the short-term fate (days) of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) added to Bangrong mangrove sediment was evaluated from phosphorus fractionation. Although the organic matter at both study sites had relatively high C:N and C:P ratios, the anoxic sediment decomposition was not affected by nutrient enrichments at the level applied in this study. The sediment metabolism (TCO2 and DOC production, and sulfate consumption) was 5-10 times higher in Wadden Sea sediment than in Bangrong mangrove sediment, probably due to the higher content of structural carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose) as indicated by higher C:N and C:P ratios in mangrove organic matter. This is substantiated by a lower nutrient release from Bangrong mangrove sediments and suggests a faster turnover of N and P by nutrient deficient bacteria in the mangrove sediment. DIP was released during anoxic decomposition in Wadden Sea sediment, but was retained in Bangrong mangrove sediment. Analysis of phosphor-us fractions in Bangrong mangrove sediment revealed that added excess DIP was efficiently taken up by the sediment particles and primarily retrieved in the easily exchangeable and iron bound fractions.

Vertical accretion resulting from the hurricane was 4-11 times greater than the long-term (30 year) annual rate. The hurricane sediments will be within the root zone of emergent vegetation for 35-50 years, depending on the local marsh vertical accretion rate. Element concentration, organic matter content, and texture of hurricane sediments varied over a wide area, which suggested that hurricane sediments did not originate from a common sediment pool. The concentration of most elements analysed did not differ between hurricane sediments and pre-existing sediments, which suggested that hurricane sediments originated primarily from the same local bays and lakes that provide material for other sedimentation events. Hurricane sediments were thicker in Juncus roemerianus stands than in surrounding Spartina alterniflora stands. Greater hurricane sedimentation in J. roemerianus stands was attributed to greater stem density there and may help maintain plant community heterogeneity if J. roemerianus is less flood-tolerant than S. alterniflora, as previous work suggests.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts. Increases in salinity and inundation were linked to mangrove encroachment.","10.1007/s10021-019-00411-8","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333274","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068828759&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-019-00411-8&partnerID=40&md5=37d6ad39867c91e27be5cf1d66514445"

Conclusions that were reached included (a) mean grain-size M z (Phi) is between 3.0 and 8.5 under fair-weather conditions and can be as low as 2.5 in storm events, the grain-size composition is similar to the composition of the Yangtze River sediment; (b) a trend that the finer half of the sediment samples covers a wider grain-size range than the coarse half is shown by the fact that M z (Phi) >Phi(50) for 96% of the samples and SKr>0 for 97% of the samples; (c) positive correlation between M z and sigma(1) supports the observation that sediment sorting is functionally related to grain-size with the best sorting occurring at a median grain-size of 2.5 Phi-3.0 Phi. This fact corresponds to the theory that less energy is needed for the transport of fine sands (compared with both coarser and finer grains); (d) the organic content in surficial sediments is less than 1.5%. This low content of organic matter largely results from a high accretion rate of mineral grains from the river; (e) the grain-size of surficial sediment varies both temporally and spatially. The finest sediments occur in the centre of the marsh, becoming coarser peripherally. Around the island, the coarsest grain-size occurs on the seaside because of a higher water energy there. Grain-size in the main marsh is also influenced by seasonal changes in the plant community while the water energy especially during the storms has a large effect on the grain-size of the bare flats as well as on the outer area of the marsh; (f) accretion rates in marsh areas can be up to several decimeters. In this type of environment, the trapping effects of plants, as well as the biodeposition by benthic fauna, contribute very little to the total sedimentation.

The semi-terrestrial soil of the intertidal area is a complex environment where hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, and atomosphere interact. Surface morphology and the semi-diurnal tide may significantly modify this interaction pattern. Organic matter and constituents of the clay-size fraction are the most reactive compounds in the soil. The pathway and rate of organic matter decomposition determines the nature of many biogeochemical processes. Sulfur transformation are dominant processes in the sulfidic grey-black coloured horizons underneath the generally thin yellow-brown surface layer. The sulfur geochemistry also affects the sorption-behaviour of metals. Oxygen intrusion by diffusion, burrowing fauna and plant roots cause a local and sometimes temporary oxidation of reduced inorganic compounds. Thus, in the surface layers, and in and around tubes and roots at greater depth in the soil, a dynamic cycling occurs of redox active compounds, which affects the sorption mechanism of e.g. metals-ions.","10.1007/BF02256778","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333283",NA

The majority of isolates were assigned to the Photobacterium or Vibrio genera on the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics. One isolate was further assigned to the species Vibrio diazotrophicus. Carbohydrate utilization by each diazotrophic isolate was examined. Abilities of the isolates to utilize a range of mono-, di-, and polysaccharides largely reflected the predicted availability of organic carbon and energy in the lagoon, except that chitin was not utilized. Biochemical tests on the utilization of combined nitrogen showed that one isolate could utilize nitrate, and that this strain was susceptible to full repression of nitrogenase activity by 10 mM nitrate. Urease activity was not detected in any of the isolates. In the absence of molybdenum two of the isolates, a Photobacterium spp. and V. diazotrophicus, reduced acetylene to ethylene and ethane, a property frequently associated with the activity of alternative nitrogenases. Addition of 25 mu M molybdenum inhibited ethane production by V. diazotrophicus, but stimulated ethylene and ethane production by the Photobacterium isolate. Addition of 28 mu M vanadium did not appear to regulate ethane production by either strain.

The contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes), and different plant tissues (roots, rhizomes, leaves, and stems). Metal fractionation in sediments through sequential extraction was carried out and used for interpretation of sediment/J. maritimus interactions. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied: site I displayed sandy sediment with lower organic matter and metals more weakly bound to it than site II sediment, which was muddy. At both sites, higher metal contents were observed in rhizosediments than in the surrounding sediment, but metals were more weakly bound to rhizosediment. Therefore, J. maritimus markedly influenced the sediments among its roots and rhizomes, changing metal distribution and speciation. Different patterns of both metal uptake and metal distribution among J. maritimus tissues were observed at the two sites. Plant bioaccumulation was only observed for Cd, Cu, and Zn, being similar for Cd at the two sites and significantly higher for Cu and Zn (9 and 4 times higher, respectively) at site I. In conclusion, J. maritimus was shown to have potential for phytoextraction (or phytostabilization) of Cd, Cu, and Zn in estuarine environment. However, an eventual application of J. maritimus for this purpose will require a periodic removal of the plants together with their own rhizosediment.","10.1021/es049932j","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333299",NA

While most studies have focused on C input, little attention has been paid to plant invasion effects on soil respiration, especially in wetland ecosystems. Our study examined the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil respiration and C dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. The estuary was originally occupied by two native plant species: Phragmites australis in the high tide zone and Scirpus mariqueter in the low tide zone. Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH. Our results indicated that enhanced ANPP by S. alterniflora exceeded invasion-induced C loss through soil respiration. This suggests that S. alterniflora invasion into the Yangtze River estuary could strengthen the net C sink of wetlands in the context of global climate change.","10.1371/journal.pone.0121571","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333308",NA

As the main local halophytes Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Tamarix chinensis communities play an important role in the improvement of the soil microenvironment. Therefore, we investigated the effect of these three salt-tolerant plant communities on soil enzyme activity in the Yellow River Delta in China. Halophyte plant communities influence the soil micro-ecosystem in the wetland by exerting effects on the physicochemical properties of the soil, and on enzymes andmicrobial community. In the soil these enzymes affect the redox potential (catalase) and cycling of carbon (dehydrogenase), nitrogen (protease, urease), and phosphorus (acid phosphatase). We analyzed enzyme activity and the relations between the activity of different enzymes, the physicochemical properties of the soil, and the microbial composition. The activity of five enzymes differed significantly between the plant communities. Soil salinity and microbial community composition all influenced enzyme activity. Catalase, protease and urease activity in the soil of the T. chinensis community was significantly higher than in the other two plant communities. Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity were significantly higher in the soil of the P. australis community than in the other two communities. In the succession of the plant community from herbs to woody plants with different salt tolerance mechanisms, a large aboveground biomassmay support the growth of soil enzyme activity and soilmicroorganism diversity.

Extensive data, collected on this estuary, were used to calculate the energetics of each of the 27 compartments identified in this system. The model consists of three non-living and 24 living compartments. The non-living compartments were dissolved organic carbon (DOG), suspended and sediment particulate organic carbon (POC), while the living compartments consisted of four plant groups, three bacterial groups and 17 animal groups. The animals range from meiofauna to macrofauna and fish. Biomass of all compartments were estimated in mg C m(-2) and exchanges in mg C m(-2) day(-1). It was found that the main primary producers are the marsh halophytes and macrophytes. It seems that although the salt marshes cover only 38% of the Kromme estuary, the marsh halophytes contribute 78% of the total primary production, making it the most important producer in this estuary. Less than 10% of the halophyte production enters the grazing food-chain, with the remainder being broken down to sediment detritus. This indicates that the sediment detritus, as well as the animals that feed on it, forms the most important part of this food-web.

In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

Multiple linear regressions of 203 samples of marsh surface sediments show that grain size gets finer and organic matter content increases with distance from the lagoon inlet, the sandy peninsula, the closest creek, and the lagoon. The vegetation parameters and surface microtopography have only a minor influence. Locally, grain size can get finer with elevation, while organic matter content increases. However, across the entire marsh, grain size exhibits the opposite trend with elevation, a consequence of aeolian transport and ice rafting. The 94 samples covering the lagoon show a trend of finer grain size with distance from the lagoon inlet and with sea grass cover. Penouille marsh has been relatively stable from 1975 to 2008: analysis of five georeferenced aerial photographs shows that only 3% of the marsh area was lost due to outer marsh edge retreat. Ten sediment cores collected in the marsh show a thickness of 0.14-0.72 m of marsh sediments overlying a sandy substrate. Radiocarbon dates suggest that marsh establishment occurred in the north side of the lagoon around 1000-1200 cal BP. Accretion rates based on radiocarbon dates are 0.4-1 mm/y for several centuries, whereas Cs-137 dating indicates rates of 1-3 mm/y since 1963, and accretion plates indicate 2.9 0.9 mm/y between 2010 and 2012. Accretion rates since 1963 are similar to the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) of 1.5 mm/y at Penouille for the 1969-2014 period.

We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

Counts of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were two orders of magnitude higher in BVL sediments (10(7) cells g(-1)) in comparison to NUC sediments (10(5) cells g(-1)). Fe(III) respiration comprised up to 100% of carbon oxidation in BVL sediments, whereas sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process (greater than or equal to70% of C oxidation) at NUC.

On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved. The results of this study should be considered in the development of strategies for the management and conservation of these tropical ecosystems, as a means to achieve sustainable livestock farming in wetlands.","10.1071/SR13037","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333360","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883588860&doi=10.1071%2fSR13037&partnerID=40&md5=427694db7749368a5c1b623c01c320c7"

The biomass production of P. pectinatus was found to increase with increasing sediment organic matter content up to 26 mg C g-1. Biomass production was low on some sediments with a high organic matter content. Further experiments showed that the increase in biomass production was probably owing to increased availability of nitrogen which is released during the mineralization of organic matter. Modification of the water content and/or structure of the sediments by the addition of sand had no influence on biomass production. The relatively low biomass production observed on some sediments rich in organic matter could not be explained by a lack of available nitrogen, but presumably by anoxic conditions caused by the high quantities of organic matter present. The addition of iron and sulphide had a negative effect on biomass production, presumably owing to the presence of Fe2+ and S2- in the interstitial water. Concentrations of Fe2+ and S2- in the interstitial water of the sediments of some marshes in the Camargue were found to be sufficiently high to be of ecological importance to submerged macrophytes.","10.1016/0304-3770(92)90079-X","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333368",NA

In the greenhouse, south Louisiana crude oil was applied to natural marsh sods at rates of 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 l m(-2), The photosynthetic rate of S. patens significantly decreased with increasing oil dosage after 1 month of oil application, while the photosynthetic rate of S. alterniflora was not significantly reduced by oil application until 3 months. The photosynthetic rate of S. lancifolia was not detrimentally affected by the oil treatments. Four months after oil application, Live above-ground biomass production was significantly reduced at higher oil dosages for S. patens, was not affected in S, alterniflora, while S, lancifolia exhibited significantly higher total biomass at 24 l m(-2) compared to the controls. The year following oil application, no regrowth of S. patens and S. alterniflora occurred at oil levels above 8 l m(-2), In contrast, the regrowth of above-ground biomass of S. lancifolia increased with dosage and resulted increasing oil monospecific communities at Furthermore, the residual oil in the soil greatly differed among the three marsh-types, with the highest concentrations in the S. patens soil sods and the lowest concentrations in S, alterniflora soil sods. This difference in oil residue among the marsh-types was mainly due to differences in soil organic content, The sensitivity of these marsh-types to south Louisiana crude oil increased in the following order: S. lancifolia, S. alterniflora and S. patens.","10.1016/0025-326X(95)00118-7","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333370",NA

Prior to measurement of bulk density all soil samples were dried at 105°C for 72 hours. A sub-sample was then taken and dried at 375°C for 16 hours to determine the percentage organic matter of dry soil. Sampling was conducted at six salt marsh sites at four spatial scales: 1 metre (the minimal sampling unit) nested within a hierarchy of increasing scales of 1-10 metres, 10-100 metres and 100-1000 metres. Three of the sites were in Morecambe Bay, North West England and three of the sites were in Essex, South East England. The Morecambe Bay samples were taken during the winter and summer of 2013. The Essex samples were taken during the winter, early spring and summer of 2013. This data was collected as part of Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS): NE/J015644/1. The project was funded with support from the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (BESS) programme. BESS is a six-year programme (2011-2017) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as part of the UK's living with Environmental Change (LWEC) programme. Field soil organic matter was measured from bulk density samples taken at roughly 0-10cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depth zones with a 3.1 cm height, and 7.5 cm diameter bulk density ring for each quadrat. Prior to measurement of bulk density all soil samples were dried at 105°C for 72 hours. A sub-sample was then taken and dried at 375°C for 16 hours to determine the percentage organic matter of dry soil. Results were recorded onto field sheets. These data were transferred into an Excel file and calculations carried out. Results were exported as comma separated value files for ingestion into the EIDC. The location of the sample sites was determined by randomly allocated quadrats. Each site consisted of a rectangular area of saltmarsh between 400 x 500 metres (m) to 1000 x 1000 m in size, dependent upon saltmarsh length (parallel to shore) and width (perpendicular to shore), including part of the low, mid and high marsh zones. Twenty two 1 x 1 m quadrats were randomly allocated to each site rectangle using R (R Development Core Team, 2014) to specify four different spatial scales (A = 1 quadrat only, B = 3 quadrats at 1 m to 10 m apart, C = 6 quadrats at 10 m to 100 m apart, D = 12 quadrats at 100 m to 1000 m or site maximum).

W.; Van Colen, Carl; Airoldi, Laura","2015","Nutrient levels modify saltmarsh responses to increased inundation in different soil types","Saltmarshes have been depleted historically, and cumulative stressors threaten their future persistence. We examined experimentally how nutrient availability (high vs. low) affects the responses of Spartina maritima to increased inundation in two mineral soil types (low vs. medium organic). Increased inundation, one of the effects of accelerated sea level rise, had negative effects on most plant growth parameters, but the magnitude varied with soil and nutrient levels, and between plants from different locations. Average differences between inundation treatments were largest at high nutrient conditions in low organic matter soils. We conclude that saltmarsh vegetation would be more drastically affected by increased inundation in low than in medium organic matter soils, and especially in estuaries already under high nutrient availability. This knowledge enhances the prediction of changes at the foreshore of saltmarshes related to sea level rise, and the development of site-specific conservation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Description of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic constituents of coastal wetland systems is a prerequisite for the establishment of long-term monitoring programs and a first step in elucidating their functional role in the landscape; both of particular significance to management. Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment. Gasteropoda, bivalvia and schaphopoda were found in higher abundances at sea and sea-influenced stations, which gradually decreased towards the land. On the other hand, insecta appeared at stations further away from the shore and their abundance progressively increased towards land. Gasteropoda and insecta were the taxa responsible for the identification of at least three clusters of stations across all five coastal systems studied. Two clusters contained clearly ""terrestrially-influenced"" or ""sea-influenced"" stations while intermediate clusters contained stations with varying degree of salt influence.4 - Distribution and abundance of gasteropoda and insecta, however, were found to be directly related to nutrient status and not to electrical conductivity of substratum.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333383",NA

The contents of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes) and different tissues of J. maritimus. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied, one a sandy sediment with relatively low organic matter content, the other a muddy site. The role of the plant seemed to be markedly dependent on the sediment composition. At the sandy site, significant variations throughout the year (a decrease from winter to summer and an increase in autumn) either in rhizosediment and sediment or in J. maritimus roots were only observed in Cd and Cu levels. These variations were the same in both compartments, probably caused by tidal water movements and the activity of the plant. At the muddy site, variations throughout the year were observed for all studied elements but Pb. Changes in the Cd and Zn contents of roots were opposite to those in the rhizosediment (uptake of Cd and Zn by J maritimus roots in summer may have caused a decrease in rhizosediment levels). Fe and Mn showed similar patterns of variation in both roots and rhizosediment (contents significantly increasing in summer). Higher contents of Fe and Mn in roots in summer could be related to changes in mass, higher availability of the elements, or accumulation at the surface of the root in (hydr)oxides forms. For the remaining elements no significant correlations between rhizosediment and roots variations were observed, indicating that their uptake and release by roots were not based on single exchanges with the sediment. J. maritimus showed capacity to accumulate Cu, Zn and particularly Cd, thus appearing to be useful for the phytostabilization of these metals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine species-level responses to 12 sea-level rise scenarios. Both hydrologic regime (-10, +5, and +20 cm flooding depth) and salinity level (fresh, 2%o, 4%o, and 6%o) were interactively manipulated. Within these various sea-level rise scenarios, we sought to determine the effects of hydrologic regime, salinity level, and the interaction of these two stresses on the productivity of Panicum hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Spartina patens, which are dominant macrophytes of fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh types, respectively, in coastal Louisiana and the southeastern coastal plain. We found that altered hydrologic regimes and increased salinity levels differentially affected edaphic conditions and species-level productivity. Increases in flooding depth were most detrimental to S. patens. Salinity levels greater than 4%o resulted in mortality of P. hemitomon, and salinity levels of 6%o resulted in reduced growth and eventual death of S. lancifolia. The effects of elevated salinity levels on P. hemitomon and S. lancifolia were exacerbated when coupled with increased flooding levels. Although soil organic matter was shown to increase in all vegetative conditions, increases were dependent upon the productivity of the species under the different hydrologic regimes and salinity levels with P. hemitomon displaying tremendous potential to increase soil organic matter under fresh conditions, especially when coupled with moderate flooding. The results of this study indicate that as plant communities are subjected to long-term changes in hydrology and salinity levels, community productivity and sustainability ultimately will be determined by species-level tolerances in conjunction with species interactions.","10.1007/BF02700165","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333417",NA

We characterized spatial and temporal variations in the structure of macrobenthic communities on an Amazonian macrotidal sandy beach (Farol Beach, Algodoal-Maiandeua Island, Brazil). Samples (macrobenthos and sediments) were collected during the rainy (March 2012 and 2013) and dry seasons (September 2011 and 2012) at six equidistant sites (50 m apart) from the high tide water mark to the swash zone. The physical gradients influenced the faunal distribution, with significant seasonal variations. Density and diversity increased seaward, while increasing moisture, organic matter content, and fine grains in sediments. Two faunal zonation schemes were observed. In the dry season, three faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal, mid-intertidal, and low-intertidal, whereas in the rainy season, only two faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal and low-intertidal. In the rainy season, the physical gradients along the intertidal appeared to be smooth, allowing the expansion of the upper-tidal zone.

One way ANOVA analysis revealed that both iron bound phosphorus (Fe-P) (p < 0.05, n = 360) and calcium bound phosphorus (Ca-P) (p < 0.05, n = 360) showed a significant variation on a spatio-temporal scale which may be attributed to pH and salinity of overlying water column. Pearson's correlation matrix revealed that sediment texture played a major role in the quantification of phosphorus species. The relationship between Ca-P and Ca was not established for the sediments of the lake Chilika, which suggested its authigenic origin. The concentration of bio-available phosphorus (BAP) in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of northern sector (45.64%) > central sector (42.22%) > outer channel (36.63%) > southern sector (29.27%) of total phosphorus (TP). This is supported by the fact that bioavailable P is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a good relationship between dissolved phosphate concentrations of water column with benthic population density. It showed that TP availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with Al, Fe and organic matter (OM). Positive association of total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and OM with negatively loading of Eh indicates towards the fact that, deposition of TN and TC is largely governed by OM availability in sediment.

These polychaetes are major component of the Macoma balthica community in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada). We compared spatial distribution between differently oriented shores in a small geographic area. Our results revealed an interpopulation variability that appears to be dependent on hydrodynamical processes, edaphic parameters and biological interactions. In north and northeast oriented flats, the higher densities of young individuals of Nereis virens are found in the higher tidal levels where we observed larval recruitment and the highest organic matter contents. On the other hand, the lower densities of adult worms are found in the lowermost part of the intertidal zone, in which we observed the lowest organic matter contents and sandy sediment. As for the southwest facing tidal flats, the highest densities of immature individuals were observed in gravelly sediment of the lowermost tidal level. Also, mature individuals of Nereis are found on the uppermost part. Larval recruitment occurs in the central area of these bays. For the other species, Nephtys caeca, intertidal populations were dominated by juvenile individuals. Nevertheless, we remarked some bigger worms on the lower tidal level. The densities of Nephtys are higher in the sandy sediment and lower in the rich organic sediment. Interpopulation variability of Nereis appears to be dependent on many hydrodynamical effects (larval spatial patterns, hypsometric segregation of sediment organic matter, etc.) and the thickness of the colonizable sediment layer. Our results suggest that adult-juvenile interactions play an important role in population regulation of this polychaete.

Largescale reclamation and artificial restoration of coastal wetlands significantly affect the greenhouse gas methane emissions of coastal ecosystems. To comprehensively understand the difference in methane emissions between natural and reclamation-restored wetlands, the natural bare mudflat (BM - bare mudflat) in Hangzhou Bay, three types of natural vegetation wetlands (SM - Scirpus mariqueter, PA - Phragmites australis, and SA - Spartina alterniflora), and four types of reclamation-restored P. australis wetlands with different water levels (RW0 - Water level at 0 cm; RW10 - Water level at 10 cm; RW20 - Water level at 20 cm; RW30 - Water level at 30 cm) were selected to analyze the relationship between methane emissions and environmental factors through field observations and laboratory experiments. The results showed that the methane emission flux and methane production potential (MPP) of reclamation-restored wetlands were notably higher than those of natural wetlands, and the monthly dynamics in the different types of wetlands were consistent with temperature. The methane emission flux increased rapidly from April to July (summer), and reached a monotonic peak in July. Among the natural wetlands, the methane emission flux and MPP of SA were significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the soil organic carbon (SOC). In the reclamation-restored wetlands, the methane emission fluxes did not significantly differ between RW10, RW20, and RW30, but were remarkably higher than those of RW0 and natural wetlands, which was mainly driven by the water level and salinity. The differences in the MPP of the different soil layers were mainly affected by the SOC and water levels. Especially in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer of the reclamation-restored wetlands, the MPP was significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the SOC. Therefore, during the later stages of artificial reclamation-restored wetlands, appropriate water level and salinity management and other effective engineering measures should be explored to manage methane emissions during wetland restoration.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106473","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333470",NA

They are similar in size and in several life history traits which promote competition. Neohelice granulata is the dominant species in intertidal soft-sediment and salt-marsh areas from southern Brazil to northern Patagonia Argentina, where it forms extensive burrowing beds. Its burrowing activity affects sediment characteristics as well as the infaunal community. When both species coexist N. granulata constrains the distribution and modifies some population characteristics and burrowing behaviour of C. angulatus. However, C. angulatus live in burrows forming dense burrowing beds in soft-bottom intertidal areas where N. granulata is absent. Where both species coexist, C. angulatus rarely constructs burrows and N. granulata clearly dominate soft-sediment areas forming conspicuous burrowing beds. This suggests that these crab species could have similar ecological roles in some effects on sediments related to burrowing activities. In this study, we experimentally compare their effects on sediment characteristics and infaunal community. The results of the experiment showed that C. angulatus modify sediment water and organic matter contents and grain size-frequency distributions similarly to N. granulata. Neither N. granulata nor C. angulatus affected the mean abundance of infaunal organisms during the experiment but their variances showed the same patterns in many cases, indicating similar effects. These results indicate that C. angulatus can modify sediment characteristics similarly to N. granulata, and has similar interactions with infaunal species.","10.1017/S0025315411000075","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333479","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864283902&doi=10.1017%2fS0025315411000075&partnerID=40&md5=a53e030af941d0d774978c61114a0e87"

We performed a field study following a plot sampling survey. The analyses of soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon contents, etc.), total metal and As concentrations and their phytoavailability assessed with EDTA were related to each microenvironment and the corresponding plant species uptake. The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. However the highest metal and As shoot concentrations occurred in species from the Sand Dunes: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As similar to 270 mg kg(-1) Pb for Dittrichia viscosa: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 390 mg kg(-1) Zn for Crucianella maritima. The occurrence of edaphic gradients including salinity and texture determined the vegetation distribution. However, it cannot be concluded that there was a disturbance due to metal(loid)s soil concentrations in terms of vegetation composition except in the Degraded Dunes and Dry River. The higher EDTA-extractable concentrations were coincidental with the most saline soils but this did not result in higher metal(loid)s plant accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using nekton as an indicator of habitat quality, nekton community assemblages were compared between terraced, coconut-matted, unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), and open water (pre-restoration) habitats. Using a throw trap and a 3 m x 2 m straight seine, 192 nekton samples were collected over four dates in 2001 and 2002 at all habitats. Nekton abundance was similar at unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), coconut mat, and terrace edge, and significantly higher than at open water (pre-restoration) sites (P < 0.05). Coconut-matted habitat and unmanaged marsh edges had significantly higher numbers of benthic dependent species than terrace edges (P < 0.05), potentially because of differences in substrate. Terraced sites had lower organic matter and siltier substrate as compared to unmanaged marsh sites. At Sabine NWR, terracing increased nekton use as compared to pre-restoration conditions (open water samples) by providing marsh edge habitat, but failed to support a nekton community similar to unmanaged marsh (restoration goals) or coconut-matted sites. Future restoration projects may evaluate the combined use of coconut mats with terracing projects in order to enhance habitat for benthic dependent nekton.

Dark N-2-N fluxes were strongly controlled by sediment oxygen demand (SOD) across the 3 estuaries, 4 seasons, and 12 benthic habitats (r(2)=0.743; p<0.001; n=142; slope=0.0170). However, some of the slopes differed significantly between seasons and among estuaries and habitats, and all of the slopes were correlated with the C-13 values and C:N ratios of sediment organic matter. Ternary mixing diagrams with the contribution of algal, seagrass, and terrestrial/mangrove material to sediment organic matter showed that habitats, seasons, and estuaries dominated by a mixture of seagrass and algal material had the lowest slopes, and slopes increase as habitats, seasons, and estuaries have an increasing contribution from terrestrial/ mangrove material. Overall, the slopes of dark N-2 fluxes versus SOD were low compared to previous studies, most likely due to either, or a combination of, the C:N ratio of the organic matter, the mixture of C:N ratios making up the organic matter, the structure of the organic matter, and/or the SOD rates. This study demonstrated that it is not only the quantity but also the type (quality), and maybe the mixture, of organic matter that is an important control on denitrification. As such, rapid global changes to detrital sources to coastal systems due to losses of mangrove, seagrasses, and saltmarshes, and associated increases in algae and macrophytes, are also expected to impact system level losses of nitrogen via denitrification.","10.1002/2013GB004631","https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333511","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887264017&doi=10.1002%2f2013GB004631&partnerID=40&md5=5ddf12df2d8a863a8ec24bea9855b087"

Sediment samples were collected synoptically at seven stations in two littoral ecosystems of the Gulf of Cadiz (five in the Bay of Cadiz and two in the salt marsh of the Barbate River), and subjected to six separate, replicated sediment toxicity tests and comprehensive sediment chemistry analyses. The toxic effects of sediments were tested using three operational sediment phases: whole sediment, using the estuarine amphipod Microdeutopus gryllotalpa (10 d static: survival) and the estuarine clam Ruditapes philippinarum (48 h static: reburial); sediment elutriates, using larvae of the estuarine bivalve Crassostrea angulata (48 h static: survival) and of the marine fish Sparus aurata (48 h static: survival); and interstitial water, using populations of the estuarine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (7 d static: population decline) and of the marine bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum (Microtox(R)). To evaluate the levels of contamination, the concentrations in the sediments of organic carbon, 14 trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Hg, As, Sn, V, Ni, Co and Cr) and the surfactant linear alkylbenzenesulphonate (LAS) were measured. The results of the toxicity tests were compared in a dose-response relationship between sites, demonstrating a general agreement between the toxicity values determined by all the tests, except in the case of interstitial water toxicity (principally due to toxic mixtures of trace metals). Data derived from sediment chemistry and bioassays were assembled by multivariate statistical techniques (PCA and factor analysis), showing that the two data types could be represented by only five factors corresponding to five overlapping chemical-biological effect relations. Positive prevalence of these factors in the cases studied was used to establish those ranges in chemical concentrations associated with adverse effects, The sediment quality guidelines. in terms of concentrations at or below which biological effects have been shown to be minimal (mg kg(-1) dry sediment), are: Hg, 0.25; Ag, 0.78; Pb, 66.80; Cr, 101.2; LAS, 2.6.",NA,"https://sysrev.com/p/117521/article/14333526",NA
