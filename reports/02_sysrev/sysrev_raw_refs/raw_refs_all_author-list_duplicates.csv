This environment has been affected by severe Hg contamination from both industrial and long-term mining activities. In both saltmarshes, Hg content in sediments exceeded the estimated background value (0.13 mu g g(-1)), showing the highest concentrations (13.7 mu g g(-1)) in the eastern sector (Grado Lagoon), the most affected by cinnabar ore extraction. On the other hand, the saltmarsh, located in the Marano Lagoon, showed a higher degree of contamination for As, Cd and Pb, which can be related to industrial sources. The rhizo-sediments of both halophytes reflected the characteristics of the non-vegetated sediment, with higher organic carbon content and similar metal concentrations. Enrichment Factors (EF=[metal](root)/[metal](rhizo-sediment)) for each sediment layer were calculated for both halophytes, showing metal enrichments in the roots and the presence of preferential layers of metal accumulation. Hg showed accumulation (EF>1) in the roots below the 20 cm depth, with higher contents in S. Fruticosa. As and Cd were accumulated by both halophytes, more efficiently by S. Fruticosa, and the same species showed also accumulation of Pb and Zn. Translocation of metals from the roots to the aboveground biomass was investigated by measuring metal contents in shoots and leaves of the two species. With the exception of Cd and Hg, all metals were present in the aboveground biomass, most evidently for Cr in S. Fruticosa and Zn in L.

JOUR,90074479,2012, Europe," Acquavita, Alessandro",author_03,Historical flux of mercury associated with mining and industrial sources in the Marano and Grado Lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea),"The ""MIRACLE"" Project was established in order to assess the feasibility of clam farming and high levels of sediment mercury (Hg) contamination coexisting in the Marano and Grado Lagoon, Italy. This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the ""MIRACLE"" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some ""memory"" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg ""trapped"" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

JOUR,90075171,2017, Europe (rare)," Acquavita, Alessandro",author_05,Historical sedimentary trends of mercury and other trace elements from two saltmarshes of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea),"Purpose Previous research conducted in the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea) has shown that this environment has been affected by trace metal contamination, especially by mercury (Hg), from both industrial (the chlor-alkali plant) and mining activities (Idrija mine, Slovenia). Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg. Conservation and monitoring of saltmarshes should be taken into consideration also from this environmental point of view.",10.1007/s11368-016-1618-8,NA,Covelli_2017_90075171,"Covelli, Stefano; Petranich, Elisa; Langone, Leonardo; Emili, Andrea; Acquavita, Alessandro"

Ditching was largely abandoned by the mid-twentieth century; however, techniques that create permanent shallow water pools for mosquito control and bird habitat are increasingly being applied to marshes of the USA and elsewhere. Salt marshes in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were used to examine differences between areas that have been ditched and those altered to increase the density of shallow pools in water table dynamics, salinity, soil and porewater chemistry, as well as short-term sedimentation, accretion, and elevation change rates. We found that the area with plugged ditches, berms, and pools in Plum Island had less drainage, higher salinity and porewater sulfide and ammonium concentrations, and higher soil organic matter than the adjacent ditched area. Despite averaging 8 cm lower in elevation, the Plum Island ditched area had less sediment deposition and was composed of higher elevation plant species than the area with plugged ditches, berms, and shallow pools. Elevation increased in the ditched area at a rate of 3.2 +/- A 0.5 mm/year, but elevation change was variable in the area with pools. In Barnegat Bay, the marsh area with pools and ditches had less sediment deposition and surface accretion than the ditch-only area, associated, in part, with the higher elevation. An average elevation difference of 4.5 cm was associated with a sixfold difference in mineral sediment deposition. Temporal sediment deposition and surface accretion was important in the ditch-only area but was absent or muted in the area with numerous pools. Elevation increased in both marsh areas at an average rate of 1.8 +/- A 0.8 mm/year, less than half the long-term average local rate of sea-level rise.

Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0-60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9 kg C/m(2) compared to 16.2 kg C/m(2) in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152 g/m(2)/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.",10.1007/s00267-015-0568-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940962398&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-015-0568-z&partnerID=40&md5=cc17350aab3de7b3bdf365b2f89c9f99,Drake_2015_90075517,"Drake, Katherine; Halifax, Holly; Adamowicz, Susan C.; Craft, Christopher"

The salt marsh has been unable to recover over the last 20 years because of the persistently high soil and groundwater salinity. In 2006, a 1 in 5 year flood occurred that completely covered the desertified salt marsh and floodplain with freshwater. The flood was followed by an above average (>45 mm) winter rainfall. Soil and groundwater sampled in April and August 2004 were compared with 2006 data to quantify the impact of the flood and rainfall event. It was hypothesised that the two freshwater events would significantly reduce the soil and groundwater salinity. However, the results showed no significant difference in sediment electrical conductivity throughout the soil profile over the four sampling periods. Soil moisture and organic content however increased significantly after these events in the surface soil layer. The flood deposited silt and scoured sand from the surface layers in significant quantities. The depth to groundwater in the desertified marsh retained a similar pattern after the flood despite 15 cm changes in depth in places. In 2004 a clear groundwater electrical conductivity gradient was present extending from the less saline north part of the marsh (0-15 mS cm(-1)) to the central part (120-135 mS cm(-1)) and decreasing again towards the south (60-75 mS cm(-1)). The flood served to even out the groundwater salinity across the desertified marsh (60-90 mS cm(-1)). The flood and high rainfall had a limited impact on the soil and groundwater characteristics. The few significant changes that were recorded were mostly restricted to the surface soil layers and on a small spatial scale. The rainfall did however create numerous pools of low salinity (<60 mS cm(-1)) water on the marsh surface that provided a brief opportunity for salt marsh seeds to germinate. A further benefit of the flood was the increased tidal reach into the desertified marsh importing freshwater from the river mouth and exporting salt. Despite these responses it is unlikely that the hypersaline salt marsh will revegetate naturally. Human intervention is needed to ensure the rehabilitation of this important Ramsar site.

JOUR,90075506,2019, Africa/Middle East," Adams, J. B.",author_03,A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit,"Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well.",10.1007/s11356-012-0794-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871720925&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-0794-3&partnerID=40&md5=55d3c107edbc67444631ef58f9b689fe,Anjum_2012_90075132,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Pacheco, Mario; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

The major goal of this study was to determine the historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) into salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) and its effects on carbon sequestration and soil chemistry in wetland soils of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used bulk stable isotopic, chemical biomarker analyses, and aerial imagery analysis to identify changes in OC wetland sources, and radiotracers (Cs-137 and Pb-210) for chronology. Soil cores were collected at two sites at Port Aransas, Texas (USA), Harbor Island and Mud Island.Stable isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of all soil samples ranged from -26.8 to -15.6 parts per thousand and 1.8-10.4 parts per thousand and showed a significant trend of increasing depletion for each isotope from bottom to surface soils. The most depleted delta C-13 values were in surface soils at the Mud Island (Mangrove 2) location. Carbon sequestration rates were greater in mangroves and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 sites ranged from 253 to 270 and 101-125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Lignin storage rates were also greater for mangrove sites and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 ranged from 19.5 to 20.1 and 16.5 to 12.8 g lignin m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The Delta(8) and Delta(6) values for all cores ranged from 0.5 to 21.5 and 0.4 to 16.5, respectively, and showed a significant increase from bottom to surface sediments. If regional changes in the Gulf of Mexico are to persist and much of the marsh vegetation was to be replaced by mangroves, there could be significant increases on the overall storage and sequestration of carbon in the coastal zone.

JOUR,90074684,2012,NA," Allison, Mead A.",author_02,Mangrove expansion in the Gulf of Mexico with climate change: Implications for wetland health and resistance to rising sea levels,"Black mangroves (Avicennia spp.) are hypothesized to expand their latitudinal range with global climate change in the 21st century, induced by a reduction in the frequency and severity of coastal freezes, which are known to limit mangrove colony extent and individual tree size. The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise (ESLR) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, TX. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1 -2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. Pb-210 and Cs-137 accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed pH over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.

Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.",10.1088/1748-9326/ab76da,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082665177&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fab76da&partnerID=40&md5=4689963860f62d688a0eace0d72c943e,Saderne_2020_90075237,"Saderne, V; Cusack, M.; Serrano, O.; Almahasheer, H.; Krishnakumar, P.

Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.",10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5,Ribeiro_2015_90074622,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Almeida, C.

The mean annual abundance was 1530 ind/m(2), and the most abundant species were Cyathura carinata, Scolelepis squamata and Hediste diversicolor. The macrobenthic community showed no standard spatial distribution throughout the saltmarsh, and species abundances showed high seasonal variations that were directly dependent on the natural environmental conditions of each season.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants. This effect, combined with the plant capability to retain hydrocarbons around the roots, points out that salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations may actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation in estuarine environments.",10.1007/s10532-010-9446-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79957959296&doi=10.1007%2fs10532-010-9446-9&partnerID=40&md5=1166a3f1de37898d2e6ba895d7708006,Ribeiro_2011_90075180,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Mucha, Ana P.; Almeida, C.

Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

Marisa R.",author_04,"Microbial communities within saltmarsh sediments: Composition, abundance and pollution constraints","The influence of the saltmarsh plant Halimione portucaloides and the level of sediment metal contamination on the distribution of microbial communities were investigated in two Portuguese estuarine systems with different degrees of metal contamination: the Cavado (41.5 N; 8.7 W) and Sado estuaries. In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

The averages of pH and EC values of the bulk soil and rhizospheric samples were in the range of neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7-8) to saline (> 2 dS m(-1)), respectively. Heavy metal and As concentrations (e.g. similar to 600 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, similar to 11,000 mg kg(-1) Pb) were higher in the rhizosphere for both total and EDTA-extractable fraction.

Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. However the highest metal and As shoot concentrations occurred in species from the Sand Dunes: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As similar to 270 mg kg(-1) Pb for Dittrichia viscosa: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 390 mg kg(-1) Zn for Crucianella maritima. The occurrence of edaphic gradients including salinity and texture determined the vegetation distribution. However, it cannot be concluded that there was a disturbance due to metal(loid)s soil concentrations in terms of vegetation composition except in the Degraded Dunes and Dry River. The higher EDTA-extractable concentrations were coincidental with the most saline soils but this did not result in higher metal(loid)s plant accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Three treatments were assayed: pots with Sarcocornia fruticosa, pots with Phragmites australis and pots without plants (bare soil). The pots were flooded for 15 weeks with eutrophic water (PO (4) (3-) 6.92 mg L-1) and pH, Eh and water-soluble organic carbon and PO (4) (3-) concentrations were monitored in the soil solution.

The Fe/Mn/Al oxides and the Ca/Mg compounds played an important role in soil P retention. In pots with S. fruticosa, the reductive conditions due to flooding induced P release from metal oxides and P retention to Ca/Mg compounds. In turn, P. australis may have favoured the release of P from carbonates, which was transferred to Fe/Mn/Al compounds.The retention of P by the soil was the main mechanism involved in the removal of PO (4) (3-) from the eutrophic flooding water but to evaluate the capacity of these systems as long-term P sinks, the combined effect of metals, Ca/Mg compounds and specific plant species should be considered.",10.1007/s11368-012-0566-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866750969&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0566-1&partnerID=40&md5=5b3653aaa6aadfb55f467d07c744fa9b,Nazaret Gonzalez-Alcaraz_2012_90074815,"Nazaret Gonzalez-Alcaraz, Maria; Alvarez-Rogel, Jose; Maria-Cervantes, Antonio; Egea, Consuelo; Miguel Conesa, Hector"

Low concentrations of soluble metals (maximum Mn 1.089 mg L-1 and maximum Zn 0.553 mg L-1) were found in the watercourses. However, total metal contents were extremely high in the soils of a zone of the salt marsh (maximum 1,933 mg kg(-1) of Mn, 62,280 mg kg(-1) of Zn, 16,845 mg kg(-1) of Pb, 77 mg kg(-1) of Cd, 418 mg kg(-1) of Cu and 725 mg kg(-1) of As), and soluble metals in the pore water reached 38.7 mg L-1 for Zn, 3.15 mg L-1 for Pb, 48.0 mg L-1 for Mn, 0.61 mg L-1 for Cd and 0.29 mg L-1 for As. Variable concentrations with depth indicate a possible re-mobilisation of the metals, which could be related to spatial and temporal variations of water table level, pH and Eh and to the presence of calcium carbonate. A tendency for the Eh to decrease in the warmest months and to increase in the coldest ones was found, especially, in plots that received water with a high content of dissolved organic carbon.

In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes.

The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh.

We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat.

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall.

(PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties.

Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.",10.3354/meps12282,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030544199&doi=10.3354%2fmeps12282&partnerID=40&md5=374b1357bf7a29c5f01bd88bfd2da3d6,Persico_2017_90074467,"Persico, Emily P.; Sharp, Sean J.; Angelini, Christine"

We surveyed > 820 km of coastline to evaluate how landscape complementation mediates patterns in invasive feral hog (Sus scrofa) rooting, trampling and wallowing disturbances in southeastern US salt marshes and assessed marsh resilience to these behaviors in an 8-site survey and 13-month field experiment. We discovered that hog rooting and trampling most often occur where hardwood forest comprises > 30% and salt marsh < 22% of habitat surrounding each surveyed site, respectively, while wallowing correlated most strongly with salt marsh invertebrate densities. At the 8 survey sites, vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, and surface elevation were consistently lower, and soil anoxia and porewater ammonium-nitrogen higher, in hog-disturbed relative to undisturbed areas. The experiment revealed that vegetation can recover when rooted or trampled, but remains depressed when wallowed or repeatedly disturbed. Together, these findings provide novel evidence that habitat patch composition at landscape scales can act together with local habitat attributes to dictate invasive species' disturbance patterns and highlight areas most vulnerable to invaders. In salt marshes, insights gleaned from such consideration of landscape complementation can inform conservation and management strategies for curbing the impact of this prolific, global invader.",10.1007/s10530-019-02018-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066785434&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-019-02018-5&partnerID=40&md5=860d3108125cef4c0efaa917e4cacdf7,Sharp_2019_90074836,"Sharp, Sean J.; Angelini, Christine"

We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation.

We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0 mm yr(-1) circa 1900 to 3.6 mm yr(-1) at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1), increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Differentiating the diverse drivers of marsh loss is critical to prescribing successful interventions for conservation and restoration of this important habitat. We evaluated two hypotheses for vegetation loss at two marshes in Long Island Sound (LIS): (1) marsh submergence, caused by an imbalance between sea-level rise and marsh accretion, and (2) defoliation associated with herbivory by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum. At our western LIS site, we found no evidence of herbivory: crabs were scarce, and crab-exclusion cages provided no benefit. We attribute degradation at that site to submergence, a conclusion supported by topographic and hydrologic data showing that loss of vegetation occurred only in wetter parts of the marsh. In contrast, at our central LIS site, our observations were consistent with herbivory as a driving force: There were substantial populations of Sesarma, crab-exclusion cages allowed plants to thrive, and vegetation loss took place across a variety of elevations. We also analyzed soil conditions at both sites, in order to determine the signatures of different degradation processes and assess the potential for restoration. At the submergence site, unvegetated soils exhibited high bulk density, low organic content, and low soil strength, posing significant biogeochemical challenges to re-colonization by vegetation. At the herbivory site, unvegetated soils had a characteristic ""riddled-peat"" appearance, resulting from expansion and erosion of Sesarma burrow networks. The high redox potential and organic content of those soils suggested that revegetation at the herbivory site would be likely if Sesarma populations could be controlled before erosion leads to elevation loss.",10.1007/s12237-016-0080-6,NA,Schultz_2016_90075449,"Schultz, Rebecca A.; Anisfeld, Shimon C.; Hill, Troy D."

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems.

These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

F.",author_02,Organic matter sources for tidal marsh sediment over the past two millennia in the Minho River estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula),"Environmental changes during the last 2 millennia in the Minho River tidal marsh (NW Portugal-Spain border) were reconstructed. Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

F.",author_04,"Bromine enrichment in marsh sediments as a marker of environmental changes driven by Grand Solar Minima and anthropogenic activity (Caminha, NW of Portugal)","A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

JOUR,90075302,2017, Europe," Araujo, M. F.",author_07,Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries,"This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

JOUR,90074917,2020,NA," Armitage, Anna R.",author_03,Quantifying how changing mangrove cover affects ecosystem carbon storage in coastal wetlands,"Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.",10.1002/ecy.2916,NA,Charles_2020_90074917,"Charles, Sean P.; Kominoski, John S.; Armitage, Anna R.; Guo, Hongyu; Weaver, Carolyn A.; Pennings, Steven C."

Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the ""optimum"" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.",10.1002/ecy.1698,NA,Guo_2017_90075350,"Guo, Hongyu; Weaver, Carolyn; Charles, Sean P.; Whitt, Ashley; Dastidar, Sayantani; D'Odorico, Paolo; Fuentes, Jose D.; Kominoski, John S.; Armitage, Anna R.; Pennings, Steven C."

Influence of Spartina colonization on the supply and accumulation of organic carbon in tidal salt marshes of northern Jiangsu Province, China. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 486-498. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Two species of cordgrass (Spartina anglica Hubbard and Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) were artificially introduced to the intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province, China, in 1963 and 1982, respectively. However, as alien species, the impact of Spartina on the tidal flat ecosystem remains largely unknown. Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, two native plants in the intertidal zone of northern Jiangsu Province, China, are C3-type plants, whereas the Spartina species are C4-type plants. In this article, we investigate the vertical distribution of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic carbon isotope ratios in different ecosystems associated with the northern Jiangsu tidal flats; analyze changes in the organic carbon sources in the tidal flat sediments after Spartina colonization; compare carbon burial patterns at different evolutionary stages in the tidal flats; and discuss the effects of Spartina on organic carbon cycling over the intertidal flats on the Jiangsu, China, coast. Before the introduction of Spartina, the organic material in the intertidal sediments of the study area mainly came from a combination of marine and C3 plants. After the introduction of Spartina, the contribution of S. alternillora to the organic carbon content in the salt-marsh strata exceeded those made by marine sources and other C3 plants. On the S. anglica flat, the quantity of organic carbon originated from S. anglica was lower than from S. alternillora but was still greater than the contribution made by native C3 plants. The introduction of Spartina not only had a significant effect on primary productivity throughout the tidal flats but also enhanced the organic carbon accumulation rate in the sediment.",10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863277942&doi=10.2112%2fJCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1&partnerID=40&md5=630e318295408c8c2d7255bb939f6275,Gao_2012_90074535,"Gao, Jianhua; Bai, Fenglong; Yang, Yang; Gao, Shu; Liu, Zhiyong; Li, Jun"

The vertical distribution of sediment organic carbon and its relationship with S. alterniflora underground biomass was also examined. The results show that the total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant carbon (RC) and labile carbon (LC) contents were significantly greater in the surface sediments of the S. alterniflora flat, which showed different intra-annual variation trends compared to a bare flat. In particular, the majority of S. alterniflora-derived organic carbon was LC in the S. alterniflora flat sediments, indicating that the introduction of S. alterniflora resulted in a significant increase in surface sediment LC content. In addition, the results of S. alterniflora litter decomposition revealed a rapid decrease of 40% in the organic carbon stocks within the first 2 months, and the TOC and LC contents showed intra-annual variation trends similar to the surface litter mass but with a two-month ""phase difference"" in time. Further analysis indicated, S. alterniflora litter controlled the content and proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived TOC input, and it ultimately affected the TOC content variations in the sediments. However, due to the LC mainly originated from S. alterniflora, the surface litter exerted more significant impact on the variation of LC content. In the bare flat core, the relatively low TOC, RC and LC content values were significantly influenced by the grain control effect, and the origins of these components were mainly derived from non-S. alterniflora sources. However, in the S. alterniflora flat cores, the relationships between organic carbon content, grain size and underground biomass, together with the analysis of the organic carbon origins, indicated that the S. alterniflora underground biomass significantly affected the origin of organic carbon. In addition, Spartina alterniflora introduction significantly increased the carbon sequestration capacity of the tidal salt marsh in North Jiangsu. Furthermore, the TOC, LC and RC accumulation rate analyses also indicated that S. alterniflora introduction improved the salt marsh soil and was beneficial to long-term carbon sequestration of the organic carbon pool.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities. Overall, our findings highlight the bacterial community succession during the Spartina alterniflora invasion in coastal salt marsh soils, which can provide insight regarding the association between soil development and invasive plant.",10.1007/s00248-019-01430-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071530664&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-019-01430-7&partnerID=40&md5=bf136b47d8e9ea54da3ae19499998dfd,Zhang_2020_90074457,"Zhang, Guangliang; Bai, Junhong; Zhao, Qingqing; Jia, Jia; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xin"

Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %). Most soil aggregates had residual Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and reducible Cd, Pb dominated in the total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates.

The total area of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986 to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH, salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH, salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in NO3--N.

However, for a long time we ignored the crab bioturbation in this area. We know little about whether crabs have potential effects on sediment environment. Here, we investigated the crab burrow characteristics in three marsh zones, and we also analysed the sediment parameters among crab burrow mounds (chimneys), flats (flat areas between burrows), controls (outside of crab bed) and crab fecal deposit. We found that sediment was softer in crab burrow mounds than in flat and control areas. Higher crab density indicates softer sediment. Crab burrow mounds had saltier soil than the flats. Our results showed that sediment total nitrogen, total carbon and organic matter varied among mounds, flats, controls and crab fecal deposit, which indicated that crab bioturbation have potential effects on sediments redistribution and nutrients cycling.

In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3. Horizontally, eight heavy metals generally showed a decreasing and then increasing trend in the 0-40 cm soils, with the lowest and highest values in S4 and S5, respectively. Three hotspots of metal accmulation in the top 20 cm soils were observed in the study area.The sediment quality guidelines indicated that occasionally adverse effects of As and Cu can be anticipated. Besides, according to the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index, Cd exhibited no pollution to moderate pollution level in these wetlands. The potential ecological risk index indicated the moderate pollution degree in soils of five wetlands.

Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion.

Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa. Thus, we recommend managers help alleviate soil abiotic stresses in the intertidal salt marshes, making the soil conditions more suitable for S. salsa growth and succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Green beach vegetation can develop on nutrient-poor beaches landward from embryo dunes. It is characterised by low-dynamic coastal wetland habitat such as salt marshes and dune slacks. It has been hypothesised that the establishment of green beach vegetation is facilitated by the shelter provided by embryo dunes, however evidence is lacking.We explored the importance of geomorphology and soil conditions on the species richness and turnover of green beach vegetation over a time period of 10 years. We recorded 107 plots along 11 transects over a gradient from beach to dune on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. We characterised transect geomorphology at transect level and soil conditions and vegetation at plot level in 2006 and 2016.We found that the green beach vegetation was highly dynamic, total plant cover increased by 62% within 10 years. In 2006 beach width was an important factor in explaining species richness, with the highest number of species occurring on narrow beaches with a large volume of embryo dunes. In 2016, species richness was positively associated with the build-up of organic matter. Overall species richness declined relative to 2006 and was accompanied by an increase in elevation due to sand burial and the expansion of embryo dune volume.Our data suggests that geomorphology influenced the vegetation indirectly by affecting sand burial rate. Plant species richness declined less at sheltered conditions where sand burial was limited, allowing the build-up of organic matter. This indicates a time-dependent relationship between the development of embryo dunes and plant species richness: embryo dunes can be a source of shelter, thus increasing species richness, but can compete for space over time, lowering species richness again.

However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.",10.3354/meps11447,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944345360&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11447&partnerID=40&md5=1a65ee2c699aa61d133ef331b5041bec,Elschot_2015_90075467,"Elschot, Kelly; Bakker, Jan P.; Temmerman, Stijn; van de Koppel, Johan; Bouma, Tjeerd J."

Sedimentation on top of the marker horizon since then shows two opposing tendencies. Coincident with salt marsh development the sediments display up to 1964 a fining upward sequence with an increasing content of organic matter. Since 1964 a nearby creek has meandered towards the sampling plot. Consequently, the sediments become coarser with a decreasing organic matter content. The morphological induced changes in sedimentary conditions strongly influence metal content in the sediments and thereby hide anthropogenic induced concentration variations. Thus, an apparently diminishing Zn content (per kg dry weight) since 1964 could indicate lesser load to the area. However, corrected for grain size effects there is an increasing content of Zn. Other metal concentrations (e.g. Cu) show a diminishing trend when corrected for grain size effects and therefore indicate a reduced anthropogenic induced load of these metals to the salt marsh.",10.1023/A:1014393201487,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036125989&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1014393201487&partnerID=40&md5=77592f857cddf18b82f695ee9a8a3064,Christiansen_2002_90075293,"Christiansen, Christian; Bartholdy, Jesper; Kunzendorf, Helmar"

The clay assembly of the sediment consists of illite, kaolinite and much less chlorite and smectite. The major clay minerals of illite, kaolinite as well as chlorite correlate very poorly with all the trace metals investigated, due probably to the weak competing strength of these clays compared with the other adsorbents and to low availability of the mobile trace metals in the system. Correlation between trace metals and clay minerals may therefore be used as an indicator in environmental assessment. Fine grain fractions of the sediment increased markedly after salt marsh invasion in about 1931 but decreased after 1964. This increase was contributed mainly by the grains finer than 20 mu m while the fraction of 40-63 mu m actually decreased soon after the invasion. The relation between most of the trace metals and grain size distributions is close in general but far from linear. The drastic turning point is observed at about 30 mu m, around where the correlation coefficient r drops from 0.8 to 0.1.

A strong north-to-south salinity gradient in the study area was a major factor influencing composition of diatom assemblages. Subtidal sediments, especially in highly productive areas in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay, contained a high proportion of planktonic diatoms, especially small-celled Cyclotella and Chaetoceros species. Habitat type and physical properties, such as particle size and depth, were other important factors structuring diatom assemblages. Water-column nutrients and sediment contaminants did not show much effect on sediment diatoms, possibly due to the overriding effect of salinity or low variability in nutrient/ contaminant concentrations. However, the organic matter content of sediments was significantly related to diatom species composition. Both sediment carbon and nitrogen were considerably higher in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay and other areas experiencing strong human impacts.

This study explored the ability of using testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) from sediments of a freshwater tidal marsh as indicators of water level in an inland estuary. The hypothesis was that modern testate amoeba assemblages change with surface elevation (approximately the duration of tidal flooding) within a freshwater tidal marsh. Variation in testate amoeba assemblages in relation to multiple environmental variables and sediment characteristics was studied through redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that a significant part of the variation in modern testate amoeba assemblages could be explained by flooding frequency, surface elevation, organic content and particle size of the soil. Transfer functions, partial least squares and weighted average regressions were made to show that testate amoebae can be used for reconstruction of water level (with an accuracy of 0.05 Normalized Elevation). A preliminary test of application of the transfer function to palaeo testate amoeba assemblages showed promising results.

On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone's testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (similar to elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh.

The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise (ESLR) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, TX. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1 -2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. Pb-210 and Cs-137 accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed pH over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.

Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.",10.1029/2019GB006334,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085510472&doi=10.1029%2f2019GB006334&partnerID=40&md5=28faad69926cd358d52f3640c59d23e5,Vaughn_2020_90075422,"Vaughn, Derrick R.; Bianchi, Thomas S.; Shields, Michael R.; Kenney, William F.; Osborne, Todd Z."

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.",10.1016/j.catena.2021.105275,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103244945&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105275&partnerID=40&md5=b9dd6a3562f60f8b6afc9b4eeb48c8e5,Pollmann_2021_90074441,"Pollmann, Thomas; Boettcher, Michael E.; Giani, Luise"
JOUR,90075049,2018,NA," Boettcher, Michael E.",author_08,Solute Reservoirs Reflect Variability of Early Diagenetic Processes in Temperate Brackish Surface Sediments,"Coastal marine sediments are a hotspot of organic matter degradation. Mineralization products of early diagenetic processes accumulate in the pore waters of the sediment, are subject of biological uptake and secondary biogeochemical processes and are released back into the water column via advective and diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Seven representative sites in the shallow coastal area of the southern Baltic Sea (15-45 m water depth), ranging from permeable sands to fine grained muds, were investigated on a seasonal basis for their key mineralization processes as well as their solid phase and pore water composition to identify the drivers for the variability of early diagenetic processes in the different sediment types. The sandy sediments showed about one order of magnitude lower organic carbon contents compared to the muds, while oxygen uptake rates were similar in both sediment types. Significantly higher oxygen uptake rates were determined in two near-shore muddy sites than in a deeper coastal muddy basin, which is due to higher nutrient loads and the corresponding addition of fresh algal organic matter in the near-shore sites. Pore water concentration profiles in the studied sediments were usually characterized by a typical biogeochemical zonation with oxic, suboxic, and sulfidic zones. An up to 15 cm thick suboxic zone was sustained by downward transport of oxidized material in which dissolved iron and phosphate indicate an intensive reduction of reactive Fe with the release of adsorbed phosphorus. While the geochemical zonation was stable over time in the muds of the studied deeper basin, high variability was observed in the muds of a near-coastal bay probably mainly controlled by sediment mixing activities. The sediments can be characterized by essentially two factors based on their near-surface benthic solute reservoirs: (1) their organic matter mineralization and solute accumulation efficiency and (2) their redox-state. Benthic solute reservoirs in the pore waters of the top decimeter were generally higher in the muddy than in the sandy sediments as the more permeable sands were prone to an intensive exchange between pore water and bottom water. The three studied muddy sites showed great dissimilarities with respect to their predominating redox-sensitive metabolites (dissolved iron, manganese, and sulfide). Surface-near advective transport like irrigation of permeable sands and rearrangement of cohesive muds had a particularly strong influence on early diagenetic processes in the studied sediments and were probably the most important cause for the spatiotemporal variability of their benthic solute reservoirs.",10.3389/fmars.2018.00413,NA,Lipka_2018_90075049,"Lipka, Marko; Woelfel, Jana; Gogina, Mayya; Kallmeyer, Jens; Liu, Bo; Morys, Claudia; Forster, Stefan; Boettcher, Michael E."

We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.",10.23818/limn.38.42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068908899&doi=10.23818%2flimn.38.42&partnerID=40&md5=2c67bdc9ead6e170e0933ee9d9300432,Cabrera_2019_90074335,"Cabrera, Santiago; Compte, Jordi; Gascon, Stephanie; Boix, Dani; Cunillera-Montcusi, David; Barrero, Lucas; Quintana, Xavier D."

However, less is known about the influence of ecosystem size on environmental characteristics; for example, do larger ecosystems have higher nutrient availability? The nature of this relationship is important for gaining a better understanding of whether the effects of ecosystem size on community functioning are direct or indirect. Indirect effects may exist when the environmental characteristics of larger ecosystems are different from those of smaller ones, and thus the different functioning of communities observed along the ecosystem-size gradient may respond to, for instance, different levels of nutrient availability, and not uniquely to different ecosystem sizes. Here, we tested whether the environmental characteristics (i.e., the physical, chemical and biological characteristics) of temporary ponds of various sizes differed. We chose temporary ponds because they are abiotic controlled systems in which abiotic factors have a strong influence on aquatic communities. However, temporary ponds are usually spatially clustered; consequently, pond locality might also be important in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond (i.e., ponds close to one another may share similar features). We therefore examined whether pond locality is a more important factor than size in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond. To do so, we sampled environmental characteristics (chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, macrophyte biomass, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and total organic and inorganic carbon) of ponds in 5 different localities. A cluster of ponds (10 to 12) was sampled in each locality. Ponds encompassing a wide range of sizes were selected for sampling within each locality. We also performed a meta-analysis (including data from 27 temporary pond localities) to investigate whether the environmental characteristics of the ponds sampled in this study were representative of Mediterranean temporary ponds, and thus if such characteristics could be used to distinguish between Mediterranean temporary ponds from temporary ponds located outside of the Mediterranean region. Our results showed that locality had a strong effect on the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds, whereas size had only a weak influence; only chlorophyll-a and pond depth showed a robust relationship with size, as both increased with pond size independently of locality. Moreover, our results suggest that the typology of the temporary pond (i.e., if they were mountain temporary ponds, salt marsh ponds or lowland ponds) had a larger influence on several environmental characteristics than did regional location (i.e., Mediterranean).",NA,NA,Ballon_2016_90074961,"Ballon, Cecilia; Avila, Nuria; Boix, Dani; Lopez-Flores, Rocio; Romo, Susana; Sala, Jordi; Quintana, Xavier D.; Gascon, Stephanie"

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes.

Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.",10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a,Ferreira_2013_90074595,"Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.",10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5,Ribeiro_2015_90074622,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Almeida, C.

Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants.

Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability.

In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

The distribution of alkyl compounds (alkanes, alkanoic acids and alkan-2-ones), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), lignin-derived methoxyphenols, linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), steranes and hopanes indicated OM inputs to the intertidal environment from natural-autochthonous and allochthonous-as well as anthropogenic. Several n-alkane geochemical indices used to assess the distribution of main OM sources (terrestrial and marine) in the sediments indicate that algal and aquatic macrophyte derived OM inputs dominated over terrigenous plant sources. The lignin-derived methoxyphenol assemblage, dominated by vinylguaiacol and vinylsyringol derivatives in all sediments, points to large OM contribution from higher plants. The spatial distributions of PAHs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) showed that most pollution sources were mixed sources including both pyrogenic and petrogenic. Low carbon preference indexes (CPI > 1) for n-alkanes, the presence of UCM (unresolved complex mixture) and the distribution of hopanes (C-29-C-36) and steranes (C-27-C-29) suggested localized petroleum-derived hydrocarbon inputs to the core sediments.

Therefore, this work aims to document the potential environmental hazards associated with the availability of these metals in this environment of high ecological value. Mineralogical analysis shows that the sediments are composed mainly of quartz, albite, and clay minerals (illite, smectite, kaolinite, and vermiculite) along with several small, reactive compounds (including soluble sulphated salts. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, organic matter, and pyrite) capable of retaining metals, which can be subsequently released, causing environmental degradation. BCR sequential extraction shows that As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn present mobile fractions with respect to the total metal content (41, 100, 57, 53, 70, and 69%, respectively) in any of the described reactive phases (Fl + F2 + F3). Calculated environmental risk indices demonstrate moderate to considerable ecological risk for almost the entire estuary, associated mainly with acid mine drainage from the nearby Iberian Pyrite Belt. In addition, the indices highlight several zones of extremely high risk, which are related to industrial and urban dumps in the vicinity of the estuary and to heavy traffic on the international bridge.

These coastal wetlands store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC), commonly known as ""blue carbon"" and excellent places to study C cycling. The Guadiana river estuary is among the most important tidal salt marshes in the South - Iberian coastal margin. Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary OM composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content (TOC) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23% and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) also showed a wide range between -22.4 and -27.0 parts per thousand. A(13)C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic C-13 enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments. Series of nalkanes were found in the range from C-10 to C-31. Carbon preference index ratio (CPI) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C-24-C-31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse OM inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant OM derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments. A well-resolved series of long-chain linear alkyl benzenes (LABs from C-4 to C-22) were recorded in all core sediment samples indicating direct discharge of untreated domestic and/or industrial effluents to the estuary. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more than 3 rings reflects the pyrogenic origin of a portion of the sedimentary OM.

Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora from the BBE is efficient in accumulating some metals, despite usually low metal concentrations in sediments and plants. This accumulation capacity has implications for the whole system through the fate of the tissues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries.

Within a salt marsh area along the Canche Estuary (northern France), four transects were sampled to see the effects of maximal tidal constraints (shore transects) and minimal tidal constraints (alongshore transects). Multivariate analyses have been performed to determine the correlations between biotic (foraminiferal absolute abundances) and abiotic factors (elevation, grain-size, TOC and total sulphur). For each of the principal benthic foraminiferal species the tolerance to subaerial exposure have been estimated as well. Two distinctive foraminiferal zones have been identified along the vertical tidal gradient: a zone I in the higher part of the salt marsh dominated by agglutinated and porcelaneous taxa, and a zone II in the lower one dominated by hyaline specimens. Hyper tidal exposure constraints the foraminiferal vertical zonation in accordance with the tidal frame. However it does not constitute a threshold parameter able by itself to explain all the faunal variations in the Canche Estuary.

In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts.

Salt marshes, which lie at the land-sea interface, are highly effective at removing anthropogenic nutrients through the action of macrophytes and through microbial processes in coastal sediments. The response of salt marsh bacteria to excess nitrogen has been documented; however, the role of fungi and their response to excess nitrogen in salt marsh sediments is not fully understood. Here, we document the response of salt marsh fungal communities to long-term excess nitrate in four distinct marsh habitats within a northern temperate marsh complex. We show that salt marsh fungal communities varied as a function of salt marsh habitat, with both fungal abundance and diversity increasing with carbon quantity. Nutrient enrichment altered fungal communities in all habitats through an increase in fungal abundance and the proliferation of putative fungal denitrifiers. Nutrient enrichment also altered marsh carbon quality in low marsh surface sediments where fungal response to nutrient enrichment was most dramatic, suggesting nutrient enrichment can alter organic matter quality in coastal sediments.

Unfortunately, the economic cost associated with assessing the effectiveness of restoration is prohibitive and more information is needed about the trajectory and timing of restoration outcomes to improve restoration practices. Microbial communities provide essential salt marsh functions so assessing the degree to which microbial communities in restored marshes resemble reference marshes can serve as a proxy indicator for the potential return of microbial function. We studied a recently restored marsh located on Cape Cod, MA, USA, by examining shifts in the microbial community and sediment edaphic properties in three habitats of a degraded oligohaline marsh, both before and after restoration of tidal flooding and in comparison with three nearbyS. alterniflorareference marshes that never had flow restrictions. We hypothesized that the microbial community would respond rapidly to the restoration and that over time these communities would be indistinguishable from reference marsh communities. We found that soil edaphic characteristics shifted along a trajectory of recovery toward the reference marshes, with increases in salinity and decreases in soil organic matter, percentage of carbon, and percentage of nitrogen. The microbial communities in all three habitats within the restored marsh were different from reference marshes, and both the prokaryotic and fungal communities withinP. australisandTyphasp. habitats became more similar to reference marshes (similarities increasing from an average of 5 to 16% for prokaryotes and 3 to 10% for fungi) during the first 2 years after restoration. In that same time period, by contrast, there was no return of the native marsh vegetation. These results suggest that shifts in microbial community structure occur prior to shifts in marsh vegetation and may facilitate the successful revegetation of restored marshes. Understanding the recovery trajectory of marshes during restoration and the role that microbes play in promoting the long-term sustainability of these habitats is essential; these results suggest that microbial communities respond rapidly and in a positive direction to restoration efforts.",10.1007/s12237-020-00719-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081895199&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-020-00719-y&partnerID=40&md5=1744c7a431470dc4f2fd09fe5c143ed6,Lynum_2020_90075163,"Lynum, Christopher A.; Bulseco, Ashley N.; Dunphy, Courtney M.; Osborne, Sean M.; Vineis, Joseph H.; Bowen, Jennifer L."

Development of aboveground biomass and MOM was dependent on elevation and frequency of tidal inundation. Aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora , which occupied low elevations along tidal creeks and was inundated frequently, developed to levels similar to the natural marsh (750 to 1,300 g/m(2) ) within three years after creation. Spartina cynosuroides , which dominated interior areas of the marsh and was flooded less frequently, required 9 years to consistently achieve aboveground biomass equivalent to the natural marsh (600 to 1,560 g/m(2) ). Aboveground biomass of Spartina patens , which was planted at the highest elevations along the terrestrial margin and seldom flooded, never consistently developed aboveground biomass comparable with the natural marsh during the 15 years after marsh creation. MOM (0 to 10 cm) generally developed at the same rate as aboveground biomass. Between 1988 and 1998, soil bulk density decreased and porosity and organic C and N pools increased in the created marsh. Like vegetation, wetland soil development proceeded faster in response to increased inundation, especially in the streamside zone dominated by S. alterniflora. We estimated that in the streamside and interior zones, an additional 30 years (nitrogen) to 90 years (organic C, porosity) are needed for the upper 30 cm of created marsh soil to become equivalent to the natural marsh. Wetland soil characteristics of the S. patens community along upland fringe will take longer to develop, more than 200 years. Development of the benthic invertebrate-based food web, which depends on organic matter enrichment of the upper 5 to 10 cm of soil, is expected to take less time. Wetland soil characteristics and functions of created irregularly flooded brackish marshes require longer to develop compared with regularly flooded salt marshes because reduced tidal inundation slows wetland vegetation and soil development.

Characteristics of community structure (macrophyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15-25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12-24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7-12 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) than in natural marshes (2-5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems. Different ecological attributes develop at different rates, with primary producers achieving equivalence during the first 5 yr, followed by the benthic infauna community 5-10 yr later.

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.",10.1111/gcb.15248,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089185406&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.15248&partnerID=40&md5=0a06b229ec01501464fbcdc33a006333,Kauffman_2020_90075318,"Kauffman, J.

Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions.

This study analysed 33 coastal blue carbon sediment cores across three subtropical estuaries of Eastern Australia. We measured depth, C content and dry bulk density down the soil profile.

The carbon isotope composition of the bulk sediment and the HPLW parallel each other throughout most of the core, suggesting that terrestrial plants are an important source of organic matter to the sediments, and diagenetic alteration of the bulk sediments is minimal. The current salt marsh began to form 2500 cal yr BP. Low and/or high C-4 marsh plants dominated deposition at 2000 cal yr BP, 700 cal yr BP, and for the last 200 cal yr BP. Expansion of higher high marsh C-3 plants occurred at 1300 and 600 cal yr BP. These major vegetation shifts result from a combination of changes in relative sea-level rise and sediment accumulation rates.Average annual carbon sequestration rates for the last 2500 years approximate 40 g C yr(-1) m(-2), and are in strong agreement with other values published for the Gulf of Maine. Given that Maine salt marshes cover an area of similar to 79 km, they represent an important component of the terrestrial carbon sink.

Two sites, at Two Tree Island (in the Thames estuary) and at Bridgewick on the Dengie peninsula, were found to exhibit enhanced degrees of contamination.There was no evidence to link elevated sediment organochlorine concentrations with higher organic carbon content or particle size distribution of the sediments. Distribution of contaminants within sediment particle size fractions, was however, related to the proportion of organic carbon in the < 64 mu m fraction. The most significant factor influencing the degree of contamination with OCL and PCB is likely to be the source of sediments deposited on the salt marsh.

Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.",10.1007/s12237-012-9583-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876833802&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-012-9583-y&partnerID=40&md5=6683e24a47e46d0221e6fc4f106a2d31,Vincent_2013_90074703,"Vincent, Robert E.; Burdick, David M.; Dionne, Michele"

The orientation and size depends primarily on the original purpose of the barrier, but this study examines the effects of berms oriented parallel to the incoming tide such that some landward portion of the marsh receives a different tidal signal than the seaward portion. Our hypotheses considered the impacts of the altered hydrology on pore water chemistry and edaphic characteristics. The results indicate that the effect of berms on salt marsh physical structure varies significantly by site. Where the tidal flooding frequency is restricted and drainage is poor, the landward marsh shows pool development, high salinity and sulfide concentrations, and low vegetation cover. In contrast, where tidal flooding is inhibited but the marsh soils are well-drained, salinity and sulfide concentrations decrease and accelerated decomposition results in subsidence and reduced soil organic matter.

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes.

The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.",10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a,Ferreira_2013_90074595,"Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

The high organic matter content in the salt marsh plant sediments along with the radial oxygen diffusion provided by these halophyte root systems gather the ideal conditions for the development of a microbial rhizosphere community. Due to the quick feedback of the microbial communities to an environmental change, these organisms become important monitors for environmental impact assessment. A Salt marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) that reflected physical-chemical and microbial parameters was applied to plant rhizosphere sediments of five salt marshes from three important water bodies from Portugal. The SSMI revealed to be plant-independent evaluating efficiently the different marshes according to their maturity degree and disturbance influence. Mature salt marshes SSMI classification grouped all the systems at this development stage, while the younger salt marshes are classified in different groups according to their evolution degree. Also the impact degree is reflected at this level discriminating also the more adversely impacted salt marshes. Being a multi-metric index, the SSMI sub-metrics are also susceptible of ecological interpretation, giving important backstage information about the underlying biogeochemical cycling processes.

These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

Aellen and Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott) and bulk sediment from a SW European salt marsh (Tagus estuary, Portugal) were subjected to sequential extractions and analysed to assess the rare earth elements (REE) geochemical fractionation and to evaluate the plants' role in the mobility and bioavailability of these elements. The results showed that REE were mainly bound to the residual (yttrium and heavy-REE) and carbonate (middle-REE and heavy-REE) fractions, followed by the reducible and oxidisable (light-REE and middle-REE) fractions, while the easily soluble fraction was negligible. This fractionation evidenced a sediment REE mobility mainly dependent not only on carbonates but also on Fe=Mn oxyhydroxides and on organic matter content. On the other hand, REE associated with the reducible and oxidisable fractions, and particularly the redoxsensitive Ce, may becomemore available, due to the redox condition seasonal changes that occur in saltmarshes' sediments promoted by the plants' activity. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the REE bioavailability depends not only on the sediments' characteristics and the plants' seasonal activity but also on the specificity of each element, as demonstrated by the different fractionation patterns observed in the various sedimentary fractions.

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

The highest metal concentrations in sediments were found in the marshes near the industrial and urban areas, whereas metal concentrations in plants were not significantly different among sites. This was thought to be a consequence of differences observed in metal bioavailability: Metals in Pancas, the least polluted location, were largely associated to easily accessible fractions for plant uptake, probably as a result of low organic matter content and high sandy fraction in sediments. S. maritima was able to induce the concentration of metals between its roots in the three salt marshes. The results obtained in this study indicate that S. maritima could be useful to induce phytostabilisation of metals in sediments, although the effectiveness to modify chemical associations is highly dependent on existing sediment parameters, and thus different results could be obtained depending on site characteristics.",10.1007/s10750-008-9340-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149140025&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-008-9340-1&partnerID=40&md5=6fab3dcea7c414f6bd8b9ae65162fb4e,Reboreda_2008_90074636,"Reboreda, Rosa; Cacador, Isabel; Pedro, Silvia; Almeida, Pedro Raposo"

Our aim was a better understanding of the influence of the halophyte on microbial activity in the rhizosphere under different site conditions, and its potential consequences for metal cycling and phytoremediation in salt marshes. Acid phosphatase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase presented significantly higher EEA in Rosario than in Pancas, whereas the opposite occurred for peroxidase. This was mainly attributed to differences in organic matter between the two sites. A positive correlation between root biomass and EEA of hydrolases (P-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was found, indicating a possible influence of the halophyte in sediment microbial function.

Both organic-bound and residual fractions were always dominant, being the seasonal variations due to interchanges between these two fractions. Phenol oxidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase had higher activities during the Spring and Summer, contrarily to peroxidase which had higher activity during Winter. Protease showed high activities in both Spring and Winter. These different periods of high organic matter hydrolysis caused two periods of organic metal bound decrease. Sulphatase peaks (Spring and Winter) matched the depletion of exchangeable metal forms, probably due to sulphides formation and consequent mobilization.

For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.)

Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

This assumption is centrally based on data compilations from marine sediments deposited under oxic and anoxic bottom waters. Since anoxia excludes the presence of infauna and sediment reworking, the observed differences in P burial are assumed to be driven by the presence of bioturbators. This reasoning however ignores the potentially confounding impact of bottom-water oxygenation on phosphorus burial. Here, our goal is to test the idea that bioturbation increases the burial of organic and inorganic phosphorus (P-org and P-inorg, respectively) while accounting for bottom-water oxygenation. We present solid-phase phosphorus speciation data from salt marsh ponds with and without bioturbation (Blakeney salt marsh, Norfolk, UK). In both cases, the pond sediments are exposed to oxygenated bottom waters, and so the only difference is the presence or absence of bioturbating macrofauna. Our data reveal that the rate of P-org and P-inorg burial are indistinguishable between bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments. A large terrestrial fraction of organic matter and higher sedimentation velocity than generally found in marine sediments (0.3 +/- 0.1 cm yr(-1)) may partially impact these results. However, the absence of a clear effect of bioturbation on total P burial puts into question the presumed importance of bioturbation for phosphorus burial.",10.5194/bg-18-1451-2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101596636&doi=10.5194%2fbg-18-1451-2021&partnerID=40&md5=1d559f309df011b2130018097a487272,van de Velde_2021_90074509,"van de Velde, Sebastiaan J.; James, Rebecca K.; Callebaut, Ine; Hidalgo-Martinez, Silvia; Meysman, Filip J.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.",10.1007/s12237-018-00509-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062156523&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-00509-7&partnerID=40&md5=bee9157c89805f2ee696b3f96de53fff,Montemayor_2019_90074984,"Montemayor, Diana I.; Canepuccia, Alejandro D.; Farina, Juan; Addino, Mariana; Valinas, Macarena; Iribarne, Oscar O."

We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests. Samplings and transplant experiments showed that plants growing in contact with mounds grew longer, had wider stems and higher root biomass than plants apart from mounds. These results indicate that by affecting sediment characteristics, ants indirectly and positively affect plants condition, with potential cascading up effects on community structure and dynamics. Because mounds are relocated every similar to 3.5 months, bioturbation impacts may extend over time through the whole high marsh, highlighting the role that black fire ants may have in the ecology of southwestern Atlantic marshes.",10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107534,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112448741&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107534&partnerID=40&md5=9f845a7ab70919f894e17f0d1aa24c7b,Hidalgo_2021_90075197,"Hidalgo, Fernando J.; Canepuccia, Alejandro D.; Arcusa, Juan; Fanjul, Eugenia; Alvarez, Graciela; Iribarne, Oscar O."

This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay.

Radiocarbon dating indicates that the three burial events occurred in the last 2000 calendar years. Two of the three events are contemporaneous with large-magnitude paleoearthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon fault system.

Mining waste deposits originated four decades ago, by the metallurgical extraction of heavy metals, are found near to the San Antonio salt marsh in Patagonia. The aim of the work was to determine the geochemical processes that control the distribution and concentration of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the soils of this Patagonian salt marsh. A survey of themining waste deposits was carried outwhere three dumpswere identified. Samples were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter and metal contents and the soil mineralogical composition. The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit. Finally, the heavymetal pollutants recorded in the San Antonio saltmarsh shows that the mining waste deposits that were abandoned four decades ago are still a source metal contamination.

A geological and geomorphological survey was carried out and samples from the mining waste deposits and the marsh were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe content, and soil mineralogical composition. Metals in marsh plants were determined in above-and below -ground structures. In the mining waste deposits polymetallic sulphides were recognized where the oxidation and formation of oxy-hydroxides and sulphates of Fe, Cu, Pb and Zn occurs. Then, by the alteration of those minerals, the metals enter in solution and are mobilized with the surface drainage towards the marsh where adsorption in the soils fine fraction and organic matter and/or by plants occurs. Locally, in the mining waste deposits, the precipitation/dissolution of Cu, Pb, and Zn sulphates take place in small centripetal drainage basins. In topographically lower portions of the marsh desorption and removal of metals by tidal flow could also be happen.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f,Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927,"Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates.

Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area.

This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss.

Short-term total carbon accumulation rates were assessed by collecting 10-cm deep soil cores at 24 sites located in marshes spanning the salinity gradient. Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates.

Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once.

Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013.

This study analyzed the environment and the macroinvertebrate community in European salt marshes 3 years after restoration using Spartina maritima plantations in comparison with non-restored and preserved marshes in Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community.

The main objective was to establish the integrated role of spatial and seasonal changes in the sedimentary abiotic environment in relation to the establishment of the halophytes zonation pattern. The sedimentary environment and the halophytes coverage were sampled bimonthly during a year in nine intertidal habitats characterized by different plant communities. The highest values of sediment water content (40-60%) and electrical conductivity (20-30 mS cm(-1)) were registered in low middle marshes, the highest organic matter content (ca. 23%) was found in middle marshes, and the highest pH (8.5-9.0) was recorded in high marshes. The conductivity and the pH of the marsh sediments changed seasonally. The sediment conductivity reached its highest values during spring and summer. The spatial variations in the sedimentary environment were closely associated with the distribution of most of the recorded halophytes, especially in low and high marshes where the abiotic environment was more stressful. At the same time, cyclical seasonal changes in conductivity seemed to determine the distribution of the halophytes in high marshes, where the seasonality was very marked under Mediterranean climate. The combination and integration over time of these spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment defined habitats with contrasted abiotic conditions parallel to the tidal line and complex abiotic mosaics inside some of these habitats, allowing the cohabitation of > 30 plant species along the intertidal gradient.",10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.05.037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020741058&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2017.05.037&partnerID=40&md5=c51dc259519248c675316d2325babfe5,Contreras-Cruzado_2017_90074598,"Contreras-Cruzado, Isabel; Dolores Infante-Izquierdo, Maria; Marquez-Garcia, Belen; Hermoso-Lopez, Virgilio; Polo, Alejandro; Nieva, Francisco Javier J.; Bautista Cartes-Barroso, Juan; Castillo, Jesus M.; Munoz-Rodriguez, Adolfo"

Our primary objectives were to quantify carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and sequestration rates in restored marshes dominated by Spartina maritima to provide support for restoration and management strategies that may offset negative aspects of eutrophication and climate change in estuarine ecosystems. Sediment C content was between ca. 13 mg C g(-1)and sediment N content was ca. 1.8 mg N g(-1). The highest C content for S. maritima was recorded in leaves and stems (ca. 420 mg C g(-1)) and the lowest in roots (361 +/- 4 mg C g(-1)). S. maritima also concentrated more N in its leaves (31 +/- 1 mg N g(-1)) than in other organs. C stock in the restored marshes was 29.6 t C ha(-1); ca. 16 % was stored in S. maritima tissues. N stock was 3.6 t N ha(-1), with 8.3 % stored in S. maritima. Our results showed that the S. maritima restored marshes, 2.5 years after planting, were sequestering atmospheric C and, therefore, provide some mitigation for global warming. Stands are also capturing nitrogen and reducing eutrophication. The concentrations of C and N contents in sediments, and cordgrass relative cover of 62 %, and low below-ground biomass (BGB) suggest restored marshes can sequester more C and N.

Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher.

This study sought to (1) evaluate site-specific spatial and temporal patterns in marsh edge erosion rates within Barataria Bay, LA, (2) develop an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of eroding soils through biogeochemical and spectroscopic characterization, and (3) evaluate interactions between erosion, saltwater incursion, and soil properties through a comparison of sites with different erosion rates and varying distances from the eroding edge. Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively. Neither erosional magnitude nor saltwater incursion was found to be significant predictors of any measured spectroscopic or biogeochemical parameters, though depth was a significant control on 18 of the measured 20 parameters. The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion. This study is the first to couple spectroscopic and biogeochemical measurements for the purpose of assessing soil and porewater physicochemistry within wetland soils and illustrates an as-yet unaccounted for potential for the export of labile C, N, and P into the coastal ocean.",10.1016/j.catena.2019.104373,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076620267&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104373&partnerID=40&md5=824421bab70bad93b66658398eb04353,Steinmuller_2020_90074274,"Steinmuller, Havalend E.; Hayes, Michael P.; Hurst, Nia R.; Sapkota, Yadav; Cook, Robert L.; White, John R.; Xue, Zuo; Chambers, Lisa G."
JOUR,90074516,2020,NA," Chambers, Lisa G.",author_05,Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh,"Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members.

Marsh migration represents a primary mechanism for marsh survival in the face of sea-level rise and leads to a fundamental reorganization of vegetation communities. Yet, the ecological implications of these changes remain unknown. To evaluate the effect of marsh migration on ecosystem function, we compared habitat, primary production, vertical accretion, nutrient cycling, and carbon accumulation between new and old salt marsh on Goodwin Island (Virginia, USA) where salt marsh is migrating landward into rapidly retreating coastal forest. Using historical imagery and radioisotopic dating of sediment cores, we determined marsh age (< 3 to approximately 616 years) across the landscape. We found that salt marsh functions generally depended more on elevation and/or landscape position than marsh age. Primary production and nutrient cycling (%C and %N soil content) did not vary significantly with marsh age. Accretion and carbon accumulation rates varied predictably with elevation in old marsh but not in new marsh. Instead, trends in soil formation were controlled by the colonization of Phragmites australis, a dominant plant in migrating marsh-forest boundaries along the Atlantic Coast. Vegetation zonation patterns were more clearly defined in old marsh, indicating that habitat types take time to develop. However, these vegetation differences did not translate to consistently different ecological functions. These observations suggest that marsh migration does not lead to permanent differences in ecological functions between new and old marsh, rather ecological functions will converge as new marsh ages.",10.1007/s10021-021-00652-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107459073&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00652-6&partnerID=40&md5=866575392d526b60ccf2aa2f90c31024,Langston_2021_90074610,"Langston, Amy K.; Coleman, Daniel J.; Jung, Nathalie W.; Shawler, Justin L.; Smith, Alexander J.; Williams, Bethany L.; Wittyngham, Serina S.; Chambers, Randolph M.; Perry, James E.; Kirwan, Matthew L."

Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the East Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2 to 16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: 1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, 2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and 3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands.

The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%.

These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves.

Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.",10.1016/j.csr.2018.01.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044392821&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d734e5a4562b0512ae5146a564922539,Loh_2018_90075224,"Loh, Pei Sun; Cheng, Long-Xiu; Yuan, Hong-Wei; Yang, Lin; Lou, Zhang-Hua; Jin, Ai-Min; Chen, Xue-Gang; Lin, Yu-Shih; Chen, Chen-Tung Arthur"

Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a field experiment in which we measured ecophysiological properties to explore the response of the ecosystem C stocks to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) in wetlands dominated by native Scirpus mariqueter (Scirpus) and Phragmites australis (Phragmites) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. We measured growing season length, leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), root biomass, net primary production (NPP), litter quality and litter decomposition, plant and soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks in ecosystems dominated by the three species. Our results showed that Spartina had a longer growing season, higher LAI, higher Pn, and greater root biomass than Scirpus and Phragmites. Net primary production (NPP) was 2.16 kg C m(-2) y(-1) in Spartina ecosystems, which was, on average, 1.44 and 0.47 kg C m(-2) y(-1) greater than that in Scirpus and Phragmites ecosystems, respectively. The litter decomposition rate, particularly the belowground decomposition rate, was lower for Spartina than Scirpus and Phragmites due to the lower litter quality of Spartina.

The age of invasion and the SOC concentration increased with increasing elevation, while the SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth.

Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil.

Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH.

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors.

We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.",10.1186/s13717-021-00340-2,NA,Gao_2021_90074575,"Gao, Yu; Chen, Jiquan; Zhang, Tingting; Zhao, Bin; McNulty, Steven; Guo, Haiqiang; Zhao, Feng; Zhuang, Ping"

We studied this issue using a case of approximately 60-years cultivation of a coastal saline marsh in Bohai Rim, northern China. The results showed that long-term reclamation significantly decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) (-42.2%) and total nitrogen (TN) (-25.8%) at surface layer (0-30 cm) as well as their stratification ratios (SRs) (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm and 5-10 cm: 50-70 cm). However, there was no significant change in total phosphorus (TP) as well as its SRs under cultivation. Cultivation markedly reduced ratios of SOC to TN, SOC to TP and TN to TP at surface layer (0-30 cm) and their SRs (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm). After cultivation, electrical conductivity and salinity significantly decreased by 60.1% and 55.3% at 0-100 cm layer, respectively, suggesting a great desalinization. In contrast, soil pH at 20-70 cm horizons notably increased as an effect of reclamation. Cultivation also changed compositions of cations at 0-10 cm layer and anions at 5-100 cm layer, mainly decreasing the proportion of Na+, Cl- and SO42-.

Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.",10.1002/ldr.3538,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078656687&doi=10.1002%2fldr.3538&partnerID=40&md5=23e583e88350f309dc61605d090b24bc,Zhu_2020_90075456,"Zhu, Yuanshan; Wang, Yidong; Guo, Changcheng; Xue, Dongmei; Li, Jun; Chen, Qing; Song, Zhaoliang; Lou, Yilai; Kuzyakov, Yakov; Wang, Zhong-Liang; Jones, Davey L."

The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size. Thus, local input and increased phytoplankton production will play a more important role in the carbon dynamics in this coastal area in the future.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.",10.1016/j.csr.2018.01.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044392821&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d734e5a4562b0512ae5146a564922539,Loh_2018_90075224,"Loh, Pei Sun; Cheng, Long-Xiu; Yuan, Hong-Wei; Yang, Lin; Lou, Zhang-Hua; Jin, Ai-Min; Chen, Xue-Gang; Lin, Yu-Shih; Chen, Chen-Tung Arthur"

Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora.

Sulfur concentrations in the soil sediments were compared among wetlands dominated by the exotic Spartina alterniflora, the co-occurring native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. The results show that the soil sulfur concentrations in the Spartina alterniflora community showed significant spatiotemporal variability with the years since invasion. The S. alterniflora community contained the highest concentrations of sulfur in the soil sediment. Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths. In addition, the soil sulfur concentrations associated with S. alterniflora also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with depth, the soil sulfur concentrations in S. alterniflora soils were obviously higher than those in the S. mariqueter community and unvegetated mudflat, the maximum concentrations in S. alterniflora soils occurred at the depth of 40-60 cm.

Here, we examined the decay of shichito matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.",10.3390/ijerph16112043,NA,Hu_2019_90075112,"Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng"

In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management.

We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration.

The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration.

Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R-ECO and R-AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP.

Invasion significantly shifts soil bacterial communities with the successional gradient of saltmarsh in eastern China,"Aims The effects of invasive plants on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are widely documented, while the mechanisms of their influences on the microbial ecology of soil remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh.

Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition.

However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC.

The aims of this work were to identify the consequences of plant invasion on C and N dynamics in soil organic matter (SOM) and its fractions following invasion chronosequence. In this study, we investigated the soil C and N contents and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the SOM, free light fraction (LF), infra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) in invasive 6-, 10-, 17- and 20-year-old Spartina alterniflora communities and compared with bare flat land in a coastal wetland of eastern China.

The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora.

Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment into Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (i.e., root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (i.e., carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground tissues compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions.

These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal.

This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.",10.1017/S0376892910000184,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952422314&doi=10.1017%2fS0376892910000184&partnerID=40&md5=350d1189b59a74e6740dea9dc8d28636,Yu_2009_90074324,"Yu, O.

A decreased concentration in atmospheric CO2 7000-10 000 yr ago has been linked to variations in peatland C accumulation rates attributed to a warm climate and increased productivity. Yet, this period also corresponds to early stages of peatland development (as peatland was expanding) following retreat of ice sheets and increases in C storage could be associated with wetland evolution via lake filling or following marine shoreline emergence. Unravelling past links amongst peatland dynamics, C storage, and climate will help us assess potential feedbacks from future changes in these systems, but most studies are hampered by low temporal resolution. Here we provide a decadal scale C accumulation record for a fen that has begun transformation from salt marsh within the last 70 yr on the isostatically rebounding coast of James Bay, Qu,bec. We determined time frames for wetland stages using palynological analyses to reconstruct ecological change and Pb-210 and Cs-137 to date the deposit. The average short-term C accumulation rates during the low and high tidal marsh and incipient fen stage (42, 87 and 182 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) were as much as six times higher than the global long-term (millennial) average for northern peatlands. We suggest that the atmospheric CO2 flux during the early Holocene could be attributed, in part, to wetland evolution associated with isostatic rebound, which makes land for new wetland formation. Future climate warming will increase eustatic sea level, decrease rates of land emergence and formation of new coastal wetlands, ultimately decreasing rates of C storage of wetlands on rebounding coastlines.",10.5194/bg-9-2711-2012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864626939&doi=10.5194%2fbg-9-2711-2012&partnerID=40&md5=5449d4b07a45c589ac1443cc73e5a820,Pendea_2012_90075161,"Pendea, I.

Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability.

The field study was carried out along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay of Fundy in high and low zones at three marshes with different tidal ranges. We used a total of 16 benchmark pipes and controlled for daily variability in evapotranspiration (ET), as well as timing of tidal flooding, two factors that affect soil water storage, and consequently soil volume. In six of nine trials we detected significant elevation change over periods as short as 5 d. Marsh-wide averages ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 rum, greater than the yearly increase in relative sea level in many regions. Wood Point marsh had the highest tidal range, but lowest soil organic matter content, giving its soils the lowest compressibility and little sensitivity to ET during two of three trials; the average change in elevation in Wood Point high marsh stations was 4.0 mm during the last trial. Greater differences later in the growing season (while temperature changes were minor) at Wood Point and another site suggest that plant transpiration drove changes in water storage at those sites. Significantly greater differences in elevation with lower plant cover in the third marsh suggests that evaporation drove changes in water storage there. Surface elevation change due to ET should be of greatest concern to SET users in temperate regions where there are large changes in plant biomass and variable temperatures.

However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ""reclaimed,"" that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.",10.1029/2000GB001346,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035693360&doi=10.1029%2f2000GB001346&partnerID=40&md5=f05816b803c4320bb6abab7804d776eb,Connor_2001_90074694,"Connor, R.F.; Chmura, G.L.; Beecher, C.B."
JOUR,90074780,2018,North America," Chmura, Gail L.",author_03,Rapid carbon accumulation following managed realignment on the Bay of Fundy,"Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and reclaimed for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canadas Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

Salt marshes constitute an important part of the Bay's coastline and are potential stores of mercury for the region. We measured the amount of mercury accumulated over a 5-yr period from 1997 to 2002 in surface sediments of seven salt marshes along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay. The seven study sites extended from outer to inner Bay, spanning a gradient in tidal range (6-12 m) and sediment characteristics such as %LOI (4-29%) and sediment deposition rate (0.27-1.76 cm yr(-1)). In each study site, mercury was measured in low and high marsh areas. Sediment mercury concentrations ranged from 7 to 79 ng g(-1) and loading rates ranged from 0.1 to 1 mg m(-2). Total estimated 5-yr storage of mercury in salt marsh sediments of the Bay is 854 +/- 465 kg. We also compared sediment mercury loading to atmospheric inputs measured at a deposition monitoring station operating in New Brunswick from 1997 to 2002 and found that direct atmospheric deposition appears to be a minor input of mercury to these sediments. We are unaware of documentation of mercury loading in salt marshes on a bay-wide scale and over a constrained (5-yr) time period elsewhere. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil.

To develop palynomorph signatures and calibrate soil C-N ratios for boreal wetlands we sampled low and high elevation tidal marshes, fens and bogs along eastern James Bay, Canada. A discriminant analysis model showed that a small subset of palynomorph taxa can effectively discriminate between the four wetland types. Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Potamogeton-Triglochin-type are important to the classification of high marshes. Bryidae spores and pollen of Myrica gale, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae are indicative of fen. Moss spores alone, primarily from Sphagnum, but also Bryidae type spores, derived from brown mosses are the indicators of bog. The use of palynomorph assemblages to discriminate among wetland types is not dependent upon the localized presence of a plant source as it would be using macrofossil analysis. C/N of bog soils can be clearly distinguished from fen and tidal marshes and can be used as a pollen-independent proxy to indicate fen to bog wetland succession. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Surface sediments were analysed for organic carbon content and stable carbon isotopes, fatty acid biomarkers and compound specific stable isotope analysis of selected fatty acids were used to elucidate sources of sedimentary organic matter.

Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.",10.3389/fmars.2019.00014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061346855&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2019.00014&partnerID=40&md5=ebb9945e4495907ebeed5203275d99c2,Brodersen_2019_90075285,"Brodersen, Kasper Elgetti; Treyathan-Tackett, Stacey M.; Nielsen, Daniel A.; Connolly, Rod M.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Atwood, Trisha B.; Macreadie, Peter, I"

In this study, we estimated groundwater fluxes and associated carbon fluxes using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance and sediment carbon burial rates using lead (Pb-210) in a pristine salt marsh (North Inlet, SC, USA). We used delta C-13 to trace carbon origins. We found that groundwater releases large amounts of carbon to the open ocean. These groundwater fluxes have the potential to export 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 0.2 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 0.7 +/- 0.5 g m(-2) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per day. The fluxes exceed the average surface water CO2 emissions (0.6 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) day(-1)) and the average sediment carbon burial rates (0.17 +/- 0.09 g m(-2) day(-1)). The delta C-13 results suggest that groundwater carbon originated from salt marsh soils, while the sediment carbon source is derived from salt marsh vegetation.

Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source).

The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion.

A steady and more pronounced drop in polysaccharide C with depth, accompanied by the demethoxylation of lignin moieties, was observed in the profiles of the saline marsh. The delta C-13 signature of these marsh soils suggested that much of the C in the saline profile was likely derived from the mixed debris of previous freshwater and saline marsh vegetation rather than from the current salt-tolerant Spartina species alone. It was concluded that the chemical composition of SOM was determined more by the difference between the freshwater and the saline soil environment than by the C source in the coastal wetland ecosystems.",10.1007/s13157-010-0130-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952004636&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-010-0130-y&partnerID=40&md5=8fbcbacc4621bb484066c886796181af,Wang_2011_90074339,"Wang, Jim J.; Dodla, Syam K.; DeLaune, Ronald D.; Hudnall, Wayne H.; Cook, Robert L."

The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top - 0-20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

We determined the elemental and C- and N-isotopic compositions of organic material (OM) in surface sediments and sediment cores from the Gulf of Trieste (N Adriatic), an area characterized by relatively high riverine input. This multiple tracer approach permits evaluation of how sensitive each tracer is for constraining the terrestrial component of OM. Using the relevant terrestrial and marine OM end-members, we estimate that the terrestrial contribution ranges from about 90% at the mouth of the Isonzo River and decreases to <= 10% in the center of the Gulf. In the southern part of the Gulf, 32-44% of terrestrial OC is contributed from smaller rivers, while the delta(15)N values of OM reflect more effective nutrient utilization. Analyses of different size fractions show that smaller particles are consistently more organic-rich and tend to be transported further from the river mouth, depending on river discharge. In the size fraction 2-16 mu m, elemental ratios and delta(13)C(org) and delta(15)N isotopic signatures are consistent with a sedimentary OM pool dominated by bacterially derived biomass. Radiocarbon analyses of sedimentary OC yield depleted Delta(14)C values (-338.7 parts per thousand to -429.4 parts per thousand), indicating a significant fraction of relatively old OC. The natural abundance of C-13 and C-14 tracers suggests a two-component mixture of ancient and modem C in the sediments down to approximately 60 cm sub-bottom, with an estimated similar to 45% of sedimentary OC probably being derived from ancient sedimentary OC (kerogen). In addition, there is a significant change in the source of organic material downcore in these sediments which, along with geological evidence, indicate contributions from freshwater swamps typical of coastal lakes with intermittent connections to the sea (brackish) prior to similar to 9000 BP. Depth variations in a core from a salt marsh further indicate temporal variability of OM deposition and transformations in a changing brackish-marine environment in the past. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The marshes had similar geomorphology (embayment), elevation (streamside and backmarsh), tidal inundation (1 m), salinity (25-35 ppt), soil type (Carteret series), and plant species composition (Spartina alterniflora Loisel) but differed with respect to the presence or absence of ponies. Over a two year period, above and belowground (0-30 cm depth) biomass were significantly lower in the grazed marsh (aboveground = 196-400 g/m2, belowground = 828-1049 g/m2) than the ungrazed marsh (aboveground = 588-671 g/m2; belowground = 4,921-6,730 g/m2). Reduction in Spartina biomass at the grazed marsh resulted in less soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus than at the ungrazed marsh. There was no difference in C:N ratios at the two marshes, but N:P ratios were higher in the ungrazed marsh (9:1-19:1) than the grazed marsh (6:1-11:1), suggesting that more N is available for marsh organisms at the ungrazed site. Total benthic infauna density did not differ between the grazed (31,265 organisms/m2) and ungrazed (45,511 organisms/m2) marshes. However, the density of subsurface deposit feeders was significantly lower in the grazed marsh (10,370 organisms/m2) than in the ungrazed marsh (16,877 organisms/m2), perhaps as a result of lower soil organic matter and reduced food availability. Our findings suggested that herbivory by feral ponies co-ops primary productivity that would otherwise enter the detritus based salt marsh food web. This hypothesis should be tested using manipulative studies (e.g. exclosures) that exclude the ponies from areas of the marsh.",NA,NA,Reader_1999_90074715,"Reader, Judy; Craft, Christopher"

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production.

Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative.

Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities. MethodologyBuilding upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and SLR assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios. Principal FindingsModel results indicated that under a high rate of SLR (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (&#8722;0.2 m MHHW) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on SLR and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats. Conclusions/SignificanceResults suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-SLR scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas. To assist land managers, we developed a web-based decision support tool (www.prbo.org/sfbayslr).",10.1371/journal.pone.0027388,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858759146&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0027388&partnerID=40&md5=43c363efed907067480167e30f8e0de4,Stralberg_2011_90074940,"Stralberg, Diana; Brennan, Matthew; Callaway, John C.; Wood, Julian K.; Schile, Lisa M.; Jongsomjit, Dennis; Kelly, Maggi; Parker, V.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption. The findings of this study indicate that freshwater restoration can contribute to controlling the eutrophication status of water bodies through increasing P sorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Helice tientsinensis is the dominant crab species which inhabits almost the entire intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta. However, for a long time we ignored the crab bioturbation in this area. We know little about whether crabs have potential effects on sediment environment. Here, we investigated the crab burrow characteristics in three marsh zones, and we also analysed the sediment parameters among crab burrow mounds (chimneys), flats (flat areas between burrows), controls (outside of crab bed) and crab fecal deposit. We found that sediment was softer in crab burrow mounds than in flat and control areas. Higher crab density indicates softer sediment. Crab burrow mounds had saltier soil than the flats. Our results showed that sediment total nitrogen, total carbon and organic matter varied among mounds, flats, controls and crab fecal deposit, which indicated that crab bioturbation have potential effects on sediments redistribution and nutrients cycling.

Our results demonstrated that the changing trend of inorganic sulfur (IS) and total sulfur (TS) contents were consistent. TS and IS contents in SEW and SHW soils showed a decrease and then an increase in the whole sampling dates. TS and IS showed significant differences between the TFW and SEW soils (p < 0.05). Water-soluble sulfate (H2O-S) contents exhibited a ""decreasing then increasing"" trend after the regulation (from July to October) in the SHW (7.86-19.23 mg/kg) and SEW (8.12-16.27 mg/kg) soils, whereas the TFW (21.35-30.58 mg/kg) soils showed an opposite trend after the regulation. The dynamic variations in absorbed sulfate (Absorbed-S) in the SHW (1.52-2.64 mg/kg), SEW (1.27-1.93 mg/kg) and TFW (2.06-2.89 mg/kg) soils before and after the regulation were consistent with H2O-S. Hydrochloric acid-soluble sulfur (HCl-S) contents in the SEW (4.13-6.72 mg/kg) soils showed a ""double V"" tendency before and after the regulation. In the SHW (4.51-7.26 mg/kg) soils, HCl-S contents showed an increasing trend before the regulation and a ""decreasing then increasing"" trend after the regulation. Sulfide sulfur (Sulfide-S) contents increased significantly after the regulation in SHW, SEW and TFW soils. Compared to the SHWsoils, C-O-S showed a similar dynamic trend in the SEW and TFW soils. Dynamic variations in CeS contents in SHW, SEW and TFW soils were similar to that of TS.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides.

In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

Canonical correspondence analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors at the landscape scale (freshwater vs. salt marsh), the zonation scale (high vs. low tidal level) and the patch scale (dominant vs. other species). Soil salinity, moisture content, pH, bulk density, and organic carbon could well explain segregations of plants at the landscape and zonation scales. However, the same factors exhibited only very weak relationships to plant communities at the patch scale.

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time. We conclude that RSL reconstructions derived from salt-marsh sediment preserved beneath Eurasian sub-Arctic peatlands can provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the Fennoscandian and Eurasian ice sheets.",10.1111/bor.12233,NA,Kemp_2017_90074497,"Kemp, Andrew C.; Horton, Benjamin P.; Nikitina, Daria; Vane, Christopher H.; Potapova, Marina; Weber-Bruya, Elizabeth; Culver, Stephen J.; Repkina, Tatyana; Hill, David F."

Analysis of bulk-organic sediment and plant samples collected along transects at two sites in North Carolina, USA demonstrates that sediment delta C-13 values can be used to distinguish between Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh (C photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -17.6 parts per thousand to 16.1 parts per thousand) and Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh (C-3 photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -28.2 parts per thousand to -21.8 parts per thousand) environments. Juncus roemerianus plants undergo little decompositional change in delta C-13 (average 0.8 parts per thousand), although there is a clear difference between Spartina alterniflora tissue and bulk-organic sediments (approximately 4 parts per thousand). C:N ratios on bulk-organic sediment from freshwater upland and salt-marsh environments converge during early diagenesis, rendering them of little use in reconstructing RSL. The utility of delta C-13 values as a sea-level indicator is limited by the elevational range of C-4 plants, making it difficult to recognize salt-marsh subenvironments and improve the precision of RSL reconstructions.

Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves.

Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized. Our findings point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column.",10.1029/2017JG004211,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059280963&doi=10.1029%2f2017JG004211&partnerID=40&md5=7151041e0a484e2ac9361b2d4fd3d1c1,Lalimi_2018_90074422,"Lalimi, F.

Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing.

Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.",10.1111/1365-2745.12571,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962537858&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2745.12571&partnerID=40&md5=48c28dacd9dcbd96acc54942480c13c1,Yando_2016_90074735,"Yando, Erik S.; Osland, Michael J.; Willis, Jonathan M.; Day, Richard H.; Krauss, Ken W.; Hester, Mark W."

Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.",10.1029/2018GB005897,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047623402&doi=10.1029%2f2018GB005897&partnerID=40&md5=e45660cdfbade7aea8c8ed4eaf9f93a9,Krauss_2018_90075283,"Krauss, Ken W.; Noe, Gregory B.; Duberstein, Jamie A.; Conner, William H.; Stagg, Camille L.; Cormier, Nicole; Jones, Miriam C.; Bernhardt, Christopher E.; Lockaby, B.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%).

Mining waste deposits originated four decades ago, by the metallurgical extraction of heavy metals, are found near to the San Antonio salt marsh in Patagonia. The aim of the work was to determine the geochemical processes that control the distribution and concentration of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the soils of this Patagonian salt marsh. A survey of themining waste deposits was carried outwhere three dumpswere identified. Samples were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter and metal contents and the soil mineralogical composition. The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit. Finally, the heavymetal pollutants recorded in the San Antonio saltmarsh shows that the mining waste deposits that were abandoned four decades ago are still a source metal contamination.

The aim of this study was to establish the soil-geomorphology relationship in Fracasso salt marsh and to determine the successional vegetation dynamics associated with the landscape evolution. This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.",10.1016/j.jsames.2018.04.015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046100223&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsames.2018.04.015&partnerID=40&md5=51f948fee42121cf3f388041d6fbf014,Rios_2018_90074686,"Rios, Ileana; Jose Bouza, Pablo; Bortolus, Alejandro; del Pilar Alvarez, Maria"

Expressed on a surface area basis, labile C and SO42- were both significantly correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.36). Lower CH, production rates in saline marshes were attributed to higher SO42- content per unit area. This effect was confounded with the effect of plant species changes along the salinity gradient. Soils under Spartina patens produced less CH4 if collected from brackish marshes than from less saline intermediate marshes.

Composite samples at three depths (0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 cm) from each site were collected and characterized by solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The C-13 NMR spectral composition of three soil depths of the freshwater marsh was similar and dominated by contribution from polysaccharide carbon (C), followed by equal contributions from aliphatic C and total aromatic C. A steady and more pronounced drop in polysaccharide C with depth, accompanied by the demethoxylation of lignin moieties, was observed in the profiles of the saline marsh. The delta C-13 signature of these marsh soils suggested that much of the C in the saline profile was likely derived from the mixed debris of previous freshwater and saline marsh vegetation rather than from the current salt-tolerant Spartina species alone.

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.",10.1002/ecs2.2828,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071876530&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2828&partnerID=40&md5=8ee8e41bcbae01c6b05213a5d140f208,Abbott_2019_90074930,"Abbott, Katherine M.; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; DeLaune, Ronald D."

In this study, coastal marsh soil profiles of two contrasting basins were investigated for lignin composition in order to assess organic matter source and degradation status under these different wetland formations. The Atchafalaya Basin is undergoing land building whereas the Barataria Basin is experiencing land loss. Lignin monomers were extracted using alkaline CuO oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Marsh soil profiles from the Barataria Basin showed strong lignin storage with two-fold higher lignin contents (sum of vanillyl, syringyl, and cinnamyl phenols, A(8)) than those in the Atchafalaya Basin. Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106326,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109371665&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2021.106326&partnerID=40&md5=3216bf8eb5f1c654c048f3e3ffbb3050,McClellan_2021_90075207,"McClellan, S.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

J.",author_04,Contribution of soil properties to the assessment of a seawater irrigation programme as a management strategy for abandoned solar saltworks,"The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Mineral compounds compose an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (up to 97%) is represented by organic substances (N<sub>оrg</sub>). The N<sub>оrg</sub> varies in broad ranges both in marsh soils (0.3-15.8 g/kg), and in tundra soils (5-20 g/kg in peat horizons and 0.3-2 g/kg in the mineral ones). The content of N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ in former soils ranges in the interval 5-20, and 30-200 mg/kg in the latter soils. In marsh soils, the nitrates content was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in their upper horizons, and accumulation of N<sub>оrg</sub> on the surface is common in them, although in the subsoils it may also happen, if there are former humus-accumulative horizons buried by recent marine sediments.

The high organic matter content in the salt marsh plant sediments along with the radial oxygen diffusion provided by these halophyte root systems gather the ideal conditions for the development of a microbial rhizosphere community. Due to the quick feedback of the microbial communities to an environmental change, these organisms become important monitors for environmental impact assessment. A Salt marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) that reflected physical-chemical and microbial parameters was applied to plant rhizosphere sediments of five salt marshes from three important water bodies from Portugal. The SSMI revealed to be plant-independent evaluating efficiently the different marshes according to their maturity degree and disturbance influence. Mature salt marshes SSMI classification grouped all the systems at this development stage, while the younger salt marshes are classified in different groups according to their evolution degree. Also the impact degree is reflected at this level discriminating also the more adversely impacted salt marshes.

These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh.

Since then it has rapidly replaced the native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa, becoming one of the dominant vegetation types in the coastal wetlands of China. Although plant invasion can change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, little is known about how plant invasion influences C storage within soil fractions. We investigated how S. altemiflora invasion across an 8, 12 and 14-year chronosequence affected SOC and soil nitrogen (N), using soil fractionation and stable delta C-13 isotope analyses. SOC and N concentrations at 0-10 cm depth in S. altemiflora soil increased during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence, ranging from 3.67 to 4.90 g C kg(-1) soil, and from 0.307 to 0.391 g N kg(-1) soil. These were significantly higher than the values in the Suaeda salsa community, by 27.0-69.6% for SOC. and 21.8-55.2% for total N. The S. alterniflora-derived SOC varied from 0.40 to 0.92 g C kg(-1) according to mixing calculations, assuming the two possible SOC sources of S. alterniflora and S. salsa, and accounted for 10.8-18.7% of total SOC in the colonized soils. The estimated accumulative rate of SOC from C-4 (S. alterniflora) was 64.1 C kg(-1) soil year(-1) and from C-3 sources was 78.1 mg C kg(-1). The concentration of S. alterniflora-derived SOC significantly decreased from coarse fraction to fine fraction, and linearly increased as the period of S. alterniflora invasion increased. The highest accumulative rate of SOC from a C-4 source occurred in macroaggregates, while the highest rate from C-3 was in microaggregates. The storage of SOC derived from S. alterniflora in the macroaggregates was 0.27-0.44 g C kg(-1) soil, accounting for 43.1-49.1% of the total C(4)derived SOC in the soil. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion in coastal wetlands could facilitate SOC storage, because of the high potential for accumulation of the C which has been newly derived from S. alterniflora litter and roots.

CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively.

In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.",10.1007/s00248-018-1168-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043696170&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-018-1168-2&partnerID=40&md5=bec71221eea542c930e65bb8a699eb16,Kim_2018_90075017,"Kim, Sunghyun; Kang, Jiyoung; Megonigal, J.

The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh.

Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.",10.1007/s12237-012-9583-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876833802&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-012-9583-y&partnerID=40&md5=6683e24a47e46d0221e6fc4f106a2d31,Vincent_2013_90074703,"Vincent, Robert E.; Burdick, David M.; Dionne, Michele"

This information is important for conservation efforts as well as for an increased understanding of how fringing marshes function compared to larger marsh meadow systems. Benthic infaunal invertebrates were sampled from cores collected from Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh, Spartina patens-dominated high marsh, and Phragmites australis-invaded high marsh zones of nine fringing marsh ecosystems in Casco Bay, Maine, USA. Infaunal densities and biomass were generally higher in low marsh than high marsh or P. australis cores. Invertebrate community structure was significantly different between low marsh and high marsh and P. australis cores, which was attributed to significantly higher pore water salinity, lower organic matter, total plant percent cover, and S. patens cover in low marsh zones. There were no differences in invertebrate densities, biomass, or community structure when high marsh and P. australis cores were compared. Invertebrate densities and community structure were dominated by oligochaetes in all zones. Oligochaetes were also an important component of infaunal biomass, but the less abundant and larger invertebrates such as green crabs, tanaids, and bivalves were also large contributors to biomass in the low marsh zone. Low marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by significantly higher densities of nematodes, Nereis virens, an unidentified oligochaete, the bivalves Gemma gemma and Mya arenaria, and Leptochelia rapax. High marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by higher densities of insects, specifically Culicoides sp. ceratopogonid larvae and Anurida maritima, as well as an unidentified species of mite.

Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well.",10.1007/s11356-012-0794-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871720925&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-0794-3&partnerID=40&md5=55d3c107edbc67444631ef58f9b689fe,Anjum_2012_90075132,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Pacheco, Mario; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"
JOUR,90074668,2018, Africa/Middle East," Duarte, C. M.",author_12,Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf,"Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)).

Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves.

This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring.

Barnegat Bay is a microtidal lagoon estuary with back-barrier and mainland coastal marshes, whereas Delaware Bay is a micro-mesotidal coastal plain estuary with sediment-rich estuarine marshes. Salt marshes of both estuaries are dominated by Spartina alterrallora. An analysis was performed to characterize marsh hypsometry and tidal flooding characteristics, and a coring study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment accumulation, organic matter accumulation, and vertical accretion using Cs-137 and Pb-210 chronology at nine sites in both estuaries. Mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation rates were significantly higher in Delaware Bay marshes (sediment mean and 1 sigma. 2.57 +/- 2.03 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.65 +/- 0.26 kg m(-2) year(-1)) than in Barnegat Bay (sediment: 0.31 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.29 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) year(-1)), as were rates of accretion (Delaware Bay: 0.79 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1); Barnegat Bay: 0.28 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1)). Regression analysis indicated that marsh accretion rates were positively correlated with rates of sediment and organic accumulation, but the upper limit of accretion was governed by sediment accumulation. Tidal flooding frequency and duration did not correlate with marsh accumulation or accretion rates in either estuary, suggesting that hydroperiod is subordinate to sediment availability in governing rates on 50-100 year time scales. If true, natural and (or) human influences on suspended-sediment production and transport in these estuaries has potential to impact marsh accretionary status and stability, independent of sea-level rise.

The dry bulk density of the mud (300-450 kg m(-3)) is also much lower than what was estimated using a previously proposed two-constituent mixing model (1990 kg m(-3)). To reconcile this discrepancy, we developed a modified mixing model that includes mud OM and differentiates sand as a separate constituent with its high dry bulk density. The model estimates that mud contributes to similar to 60% of the total marsh vertical accretion in Louisiana, considerably higher than the similar to 14% estimated with the two-constituent mixing model. The result, which is a direct consequence of the relatively high porosity of mud, highlights that mud deposition is crucial for the accretion of microtidal marshes. Further, the model estimates that the mud OM constitutes similar to 60% of the total soil OM, emphasizing that in situ plant production is not the only-and, in minerogenic marshes, not the major-contributor to OM accumulation.",10.1002/lno.11475,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086259764&doi=10.1002%2flno.11475&partnerID=40&md5=d2299ab9495a06785020cf797d863924,Mariotti_2020_90074860,"Mariotti, G.; Elsey-Quirk, T.; Bruno, G.; Valentine, K."

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.",10.1002/ecs2.2828,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071876530&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2828&partnerID=40&md5=8ee8e41bcbae01c6b05213a5d140f208,Abbott_2019_90074930,"Abbott, Katherine M.; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; DeLaune, Ronald D."

Here, we quantify how marsh erosion differs between saline and brackish marshes of the Mississippi Delta. We analyzed long-term (1932-2015) maps of marsh loss and developed an algorithm to distinguish edge erosion from interior loss. We found that the edge erosion rate remains nearly constant at decadal timescales, whereas interior loss varies by more than 100%. On average, roughly half of marsh loss can be attributed to edge erosion, the other half to interior loss. Based on data from 42 cores, brackish marsh soils had a lower bulk density (0.17 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3)), a higher organic content (43% vs. 26%), a lower shear strength (2.0 vs. 2.5 kPa), and a lower shear strength in the root layer (13.8 vs. 20.7 kPa) than saline marsh soils. We then modified an existing marsh edge erosion model by including a salinity-dependent erodibility. By calibrating the erodibility with the observed retreat rates, we found that the brackish marsh is two to three times more erodible than the saline marshes. Overall, this model advances the ability to simulate estuarine systems as a whole, thus transcending the salinity boundaries often used in compartmentalized marsh models.",10.1002/esp.5108,NA,Valentine_2021_90075038,"Valentine, Kendall; Bruno, Grayton; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"

Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.",10.1007/s13157-021-01528-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122921800&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-021-01528-0&partnerID=40&md5=5177269d35eb348e8e758c2290d7f0bb,Valentine_2022_90075040,"Valentine, Kendall; Hotard, Abbey; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"

Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates.

This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the ""MIRACLE"" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some ""memory"" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg ""trapped"" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

JOUR,90075171,2017, Europe (rare)," Emili, Andrea",author_04,Historical sedimentary trends of mercury and other trace elements from two saltmarshes of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea),"Purpose Previous research conducted in the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea) has shown that this environment has been affected by trace metal contamination, especially by mercury (Hg), from both industrial (the chlor-alkali plant) and mining activities (Idrija mine, Slovenia). Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg.

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

There were insignificant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the distribution of live and dead species.

Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat.

Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the western most fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br-) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8-75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3-13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8-13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1-8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br- rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111-253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br-] of interstitial waters (129 mu g/L-79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1-508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14-173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic ""model"". As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br- upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

A low-salinity tidal flat, dominated by Trochamminita salsa, Haplophragmoides spp. and Cribrostomoides spp., prevailed from AD 140-1360 (Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages, Medieval Climatic Anomaly). This sheltered environment was affected by high hydrodynamic episodes, marked by the increase in silt/clay ratio, decrease of organic matter, and poor and weakly preserved foraminiferal assemblages, suggesting enhanced river runoff. The establishment of low marsh began at AD 1380. This low-salinity environment, marked by colder and wet conditions, persisted from AD 1410-1770 (Little Ice Age), when foraminiferal density increased significantly. Haplophragmoides manilaensis and Trochamminita salsa mark the transition from low to high marsh at AD 1730. Since AD 1780 the abundances of salt marsh species (Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata) increased, accompanied by a decrease in foraminiferal density, reflecting climate instability, when droughts alternate with severe floods.

JOUR,90074699,2018,NA," Fatela, Francisco",author_05,Refractory organic matter in coastal salt marshes-effect on C sequestration calculations,"The age and ability of salt marshes to accumulate and sequester carbon is often assessed using the carbon isotopic signatures (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) of sedimentary organic matter. However, transfers of allochthonous refractory carbon (C-RF) from the watershed to marshes would not represent new C sequestration. To better understand how refractory carbon (C-RF) inputs affect assessments of marsh age and C sequestration, Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of both total organic carbon (TOC), C-RF, and non-C-RF organic matter fractions were measured in salt marshes from four contrasting systems on the North Atlantic coast. To our knowledge, no salt marsh sediment study has considered refractory or allochthonous carbon in carbon budget calculations or the impact on chronologies. Stable and radiogenic isotope data suggest that while TOC was dominated by autochthonous plant inputs, C-RF was dominated by locally recycled or allochthonous C, the delivery of which was controlled by the size and slope of each watershed. Steep-gradient rivers analyzed delivered Delta C-14-depleted C-RF to their estuarine marshes, while the site located in the low-gradient river was associated with larger C-RF content. Finally, the marsh isolated from riverine input contained the least fraction of TOC as C-RF. Laterally transported C-RF caused only a small offset in Delta C-14 in relation to TOC in low-gradient systems (average Delta C-14 offset was -44.4 and -24.2 parts per thousand at each location). However, the presence of allochthonous Delta C-14-depleted C-RF in sediments of steep-gradient rivers led to large overestimates of the time of organic matter deposition (i.e. apparent age was older than the 'true' time of deposition) (Delta C-14 offset ranged from -170.6 to -528.9 parts per thousand). Further, reliance on TOC or loss on ignition analyses to calculate C sequestration by marshes might produce overestimates of at least as much as 10 to 20% since neither account for the lateral transport of allochthonous carbon.

In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year.

Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude.

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107433584&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107875&partnerID=40&md5=c57f77f001595b38968fd0652dc8bd4f,Cui_2021_90074357,"Cui, Lina; Sun, Huimin; Du, Xuhua; Feng, Wenting; Wang, Yugang; Zhang, Jinchi; Jiang, Jiang"
JOUR,90075428,2019,NA," Feng, Wenting",author_04,Soil organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in a subtropical mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems,"Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon.

This study analyzed the environment and the macroinvertebrate community in European salt marshes 3 years after restoration using Spartina maritima plantations in comparison with non-restored and preserved marshes in Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community.

Our primary objectives were to quantify carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and sequestration rates in restored marshes dominated by Spartina maritima to provide support for restoration and management strategies that may offset negative aspects of eutrophication and climate change in estuarine ecosystems. Sediment C content was between ca. 13 mg C g(-1)and sediment N content was ca. 1.8 mg N g(-1). The highest C content for S. maritima was recorded in leaves and stems (ca. 420 mg C g(-1)) and the lowest in roots (361 +/- 4 mg C g(-1)). S. maritima also concentrated more N in its leaves (31 +/- 1 mg N g(-1)) than in other organs. C stock in the restored marshes was 29.6 t C ha(-1); ca. 16 % was stored in S. maritima tissues. N stock was 3.6 t N ha(-1), with 8.3 % stored in S. maritima. Our results showed that the S. maritima restored marshes, 2.5 years after planting, were sequestering atmospheric C and, therefore, provide some mitigation for global warming. Stands are also capturing nitrogen and reducing eutrophication. The concentrations of C and N contents in sediments, and cordgrass relative cover of 62 %, and low below-ground biomass (BGB) suggest restored marshes can sequester more C and N. S. maritima plantations in low marshes replace bare sediments and invasive populations of exotic Spartina densiflora and increase the C and N sequestration capacity of the marsh by increasing biomass production and accumulation.",10.1007/s10661-013-3185-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884357163&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-013-3185-4&partnerID=40&md5=0678f27afd8c109e2b4d95e8a771d965,Curado_2013_90074936,"Curado, Guillermo; Rubio-Casal, Alfredo E.; Figueroa, Enrique; Grewell, Brenda J.; Castillo, Jesus M."
JOUR,90074516,2020,NA," Foster, Tammy E.",author_02,Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh,"Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts.

For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

C.",author_07,"Bromine enrichment in marsh sediments as a marker of environmental changes driven by Grand Solar Minima and anthropogenic activity (Caminha, NW of Portugal)","A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

High-resolution Holocene sea-level reconstructions depend on the accurate characterization of modern foraminifera-environment relationships representative of a study site. We investigate the relationship between modern foraminiferal assemblage distribution and key environmental variables, viz. elevation above land levelling datum (LLD), sediment grain size, organic content, pH and salinity. We hypothesize that the distribution of modern salt-marsh foraminifera is primarily controlled by elevation above LLD.Location Knysna and Keiskamma estuaries along the southern coastline of South Africa.Methods Salt-marsh surface sediment samples (n = 97) were collected along eight intertidal transects with corresponding environmental data (pH, salinity, organic content, sand, silt, clay and elevation). Multivariate ordination analysis (partial redundancy analysis; pRDA) was used to investigate the relationship between living foraminiferal assemblages and environmental controls, after accounting for spatial variability in community composition.Results The pRDA suggests that species composition varied spatially within estuaries, but was strongly influenced by elevation at Keiskamma (r = 0.63) and Knysna (r = -0.75). At Keiskamma, the main gradient in composition was also influenced by salinity (r = -0.63), in an equal and opposite manner to elevation. Composition at Keiskamma was influenced to a much lesser extent by sediment organic content (r = 0.20) and the clay fraction (r = -0.13). At Knysna, pH (r = 0.455) was a secondary determinant of composition, and sediment characteristics covaried with elevation.Main conclusion Elevation was found to be a key environmental variable controlling the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera at both estuaries, thereby validating the use of foraminifera as sea-level indicators. Certain species were particularly sensitive to elevation changes and could thus serve as useful indicators of past sea-level change.

Recent associations of Foraminifera and Ostracoda from low intertidal to supratidal settings of the barrier island of Spiekeroog in combination with environmental parameters (granulomeny, C/N, total organic carbon, salinity) were investigated and quantified in elevation steps of 15 cm in order to generate a first transfer function (TF) of Holocene RSL change. In a future step, the TF can be applied to the stratigraphic record. Our data show a clear vertical zonation of foraminifer and ostracod taxa between the middle salt marsh and the tidal flat with very few individuals in the sand flat area, suggesting removal by the tidal current or poor preservation. Multivariate statistics identify the elevation, corresponding to the inundation frequency, as main driving factor. The smallest vertical error (49 cm) is associated with an entirely new approach of combining Foraminifera and Ostracoda for a TF. Advantages of the TF over classical RSL indicators such as basal and intercalated peats - beside the relatively narrow indicative meaning - include the possible application to a wide range of intertidal facies and that the resulting RSL curve does not depend on compaction-prone peats.",10.20341/gb.2019.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073560714&doi=10.20341%2fgb.2019.007&partnerID=40&md5=cf10d815378c2d5b2a45df234e349f7f,Scheder_2019_90075134,"Scheder, Juliane; Frenzel, Peter; Bungenstock, Friederike; Engel, Max; Brueckner, Helmut; Pint, Anna"

JOUR,90074244,2014,NA," Fu, Xiaohua",author_08,Variability in soil microbial community and activity between coastal and riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary - Potential impacts on carbon sequestration,"Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that the organic carbon content of wetland soil vegetated with Phragmites australis (site A) was markedly lower than that with P australis and Spartina altemiflora (site B). Sites differences were due to higher microbial activity at site A, which led to higher soil respiration intensity and greater carbon outputs. This indicated that the capability of organic carbon accumulation of the site B soils was greater than at site A. In addition, petroleum pollution and soil salinity were different in the two wetland soils. After bio-remediation, the soil petroleum pollution at site B was reduced to a similar level of site A. However, the culturable microbial biomass and enzyme activity in the remediated soils were also lower than at site A.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage.

The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

The annual secondary productivity and P/B ratio of the macrobenthos in the flat were estimated as 18.58 g AFDM (ash free dry mass) . m(-2) . a(-1) and 0.97, respectively, and the secondary productivity in the Spartina alterniflora marshes of the upper intertidal flat (8.97g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)) was much lower than that in the bare flat of the lower intertidal zone (28.19 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), Since the introduction of S. alterniflora by the end of the 1980s, the secondary productivity of the macrobenthos in the flat had increased about 4 folds. Musculus senhousei, which inhabited in the lower bare flat, contributed 66.4% of the total macrobenthos secondary productivity in the entire intertidal flat. If the contribution from M. senhousei was not taken into account, the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the salt marshes would be significantly higher than that in the bare flat, and the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the intertidal flat would have less change. The successful colonization of M. senhousei was partly attributed to the changes of sediment composition enhanced by S. alterniflora due to its capability in trapping fine-grained materials; this species' feeding activities result in a remarkable increase of sediment chlorophyll a content. There was a significant positive correlation between the secondary productivity of macrobenthos and the sediment chlorophyll a and/or organic matter contents.

In 0-50cm soils, the mean values of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and readily oxidized organic carbon (ROOC) were higher in FIW and SIW than those in MIW, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a higher mean value in MIW. Along the 0-50cm soil profile, SOC, MBC, ROOC and DOC decreased as the soil depth increased in FIW and SIW. However, in MIW, soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later. The annual mean values of SOC in 0-50 cm soils were 6.87 g/kg in FIW, 4.92 g/kg in MIW and 5.42 g/kg in SIW, respectively. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) values for FIW, MIW and SIW were 4.55, 3.26 and 3.84 kg C/m(2), respectively.

Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that the largest number of discriminating bacterial and archaeal taxa was found in TW. The Mantel test and Spearman correlation analysis showed that environmental variables (i.e. salinity, soil organic matter and soil texture) influenced the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure.

Multivariate analysis showed a clear discrimination in functioning between sites with the fresh and brackish marshes having a more similar functioning compared to low and middle marshes.

It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity.

We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.",10.23818/limn.38.42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068908899&doi=10.23818%2flimn.38.42&partnerID=40&md5=2c67bdc9ead6e170e0933ee9d9300432,Cabrera_2019_90074335,"Cabrera, Santiago; Compte, Jordi; Gascon, Stephanie; Boix, Dani; Cunillera-Montcusi, David; Barrero, Lucas; Quintana, Xavier D."

However, less is known about the influence of ecosystem size on environmental characteristics; for example, do larger ecosystems have higher nutrient availability? The nature of this relationship is important for gaining a better understanding of whether the effects of ecosystem size on community functioning are direct or indirect. Indirect effects may exist when the environmental characteristics of larger ecosystems are different from those of smaller ones, and thus the different functioning of communities observed along the ecosystem-size gradient may respond to, for instance, different levels of nutrient availability, and not uniquely to different ecosystem sizes. Here, we tested whether the environmental characteristics (i.e., the physical, chemical and biological characteristics) of temporary ponds of various sizes differed. We chose temporary ponds because they are abiotic controlled systems in which abiotic factors have a strong influence on aquatic communities. However, temporary ponds are usually spatially clustered; consequently, pond locality might also be important in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond (i.e., ponds close to one another may share similar features). We therefore examined whether pond locality is a more important factor than size in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond. To do so, we sampled environmental characteristics (chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, macrophyte biomass, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and total organic and inorganic carbon) of ponds in 5 different localities. A cluster of ponds (10 to 12) was sampled in each locality. Ponds encompassing a wide range of sizes were selected for sampling within each locality. We also performed a meta-analysis (including data from 27 temporary pond localities) to investigate whether the environmental characteristics of the ponds sampled in this study were representative of Mediterranean temporary ponds, and thus if such characteristics could be used to distinguish between Mediterranean temporary ponds from temporary ponds located outside of the Mediterranean region. Our results showed that locality had a strong effect on the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds, whereas size had only a weak influence; only chlorophyll-a and pond depth showed a robust relationship with size, as both increased with pond size independently of locality. Moreover, our results suggest that the typology of the temporary pond (i.e., if they were mountain temporary ponds, salt marsh ponds or lowland ponds) had a larger influence on several environmental characteristics than did regional location (i.e., Mediterranean).",NA,NA,Ballon_2016_90074961,"Ballon, Cecilia; Avila, Nuria; Boix, Dani; Lopez-Flores, Rocio; Romo, Susana; Sala, Jordi; Quintana, Xavier D.; Gascon, Stephanie"

This paper studied the biomass difference, the spatiotemporal dynamics and vertical distribution of soil carbon storage in three dominant saltmarsh plant communities, i. e., Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter in the Chongming Dongtan wetland, in the Yangtze Estuary. The results indicated that the gross biomass in the three saltmarsh plant communities was in the order of S. alterniflora (5750.7 g . m(-2)) > P. australis (4655.1 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter (812.7 g . m(-2)). The aboveground biomass was the highest in summer, and autumn, and the underground biomass was the highest in winter. The soil carbon storage (0-50 cm) was the lowest in spring, gradually increased, and was the highest in winter. The annual increment of soil carbon storage decreased from the high tidal zone to the low tidal zone, and was in the order of P. australis community (711.8 g . m(-2)) > S. alterniflora community (646.2 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter community (185.3 g . m(-2)) > bare mudflat (65.6 g . m(-2)).

Spatio-temporal distributions of the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks therein are affected by both biological and environmental factors. In this paper, spatio-temporal distribution and vertical distribution (0-50 cm) of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in the Dongtan wetlands during 2013 was studied. Results show that both the SOC and TN stocks varied seasonally, following an order of winter > autumn > summer > spring, and accumulated with the time passing by, and varied spatially, too, showing a decreasing order of Phagmites australis belt in high tidal marsh > Spartina alterniflora belt in medium-tidal marsh > Scirpus mariqueter belt in low-tidal marsh > bare mudflat. However, along the belts, regardless of vegetation, the SOC and TN stocks was higher in the northern transect than in the middle and southern transects. Vertically the stocks distributed in the soil profiles in similar patterns in all areas. Generally SOC stock peaked in the >10-15 cm soil layer in the mudflat and S. mariqueter marsh, and in the surface soil layer(0-10 cm soil layer) and the >20-30 cm soil layer in the P. australis marsh and S. alterniflora marsh. The vertical distribution of TN stock was quite similar to that of SOC stock, showing an extremely significant positive correlation (P<0.01).

In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks.

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates.

For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions and a lack of tidal influence, transformation of the former salt marsh to grassland resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were similar to those of the natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J.",author_04,Organic matter sources for tidal marsh sediment over the past two millennia in the Minho River estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula),"Environmental changes during the last 2 millennia in the Minho River tidal marsh (NW Portugal-Spain border) were reconstructed. Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (<= 1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (delta C-13), and age ((FC)-C-14) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented similar to 9%-17% of shallow SOC (<= 26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.Key Points.Salt marsh soils preserved compounds with a range of reactivities that were derived from local grasses9%-17% of surface soil carbon was old, likely reflecting redeposition of eroded creekbank materialDecomposition decreases soil organic carbon thermal reactivity, and disturbances accelerate this shift, particularly in surface horizons",10.1029/2020GL090287,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099777956&doi=10.1029%2f2020GL090287&partnerID=40&md5=718ae426665bb4b6e02a6420ba5a8348,Luk_2021_90074440,"Luk, Sheron Y.; Todd-Brown, Katherine; Eagle, Meagan; McNichol, Ann P.; Sanderman, Jonathan; Gosselin, Kelsey; Spivak, Amanda C."

These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.",10.1002/2017JG003780,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020705442&doi=10.1002%2f2017JG003780&partnerID=40&md5=cc8df285de677dc95dfa9e92f1285784,Spivak_2017_90075116,"Spivak, Amanda C.; Gosselin, Kelsey; Howard, Evan; Mariotti, Giulio; Forbrich, Inke; Stanley, Rachel; Sylva, Sean P."

Using a chronosequence approach, we examined the effects of sediment enhancement in deteriorating marsh and open-water pond habitats located in six brackish marshes. Sediment enhancement of both marsh and interior pond sites had significant, immediate, and long-lasting effects on physical soil properties and nutrient status with increased bulk density and inorganic nitrogen.

Using shallow water ponds rehabititated with a technique called marsh terracing, we examined the quality of nekton habitat created, using and comparing several metrics including nekton density and diversity, functional group composition, and weight-length relationships as indirect measures of habitat quality. We examined three paired terraced and unterraced marsh ponds in southwest Louisiana. Nekton, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and soil and water quality variables were sampled bimonthly from April 2004 through April 2005 at four subtidal habitat types: terraced nearshore, terraced open water, unterraced nearshore, and unterraced open water. Results indicate that terraced ponds had increased the habitat value of degrading unterraced ponds over open water areas for estuarine nekton; nekton density and richness were similar between terraced and unterraced nearshore habitat types, but greater at all nearshore as compared to open water sites. Analysis of the distribution of nekton functional groups and weight:length ratios indicates the terraced and unterraced pond habitats were not functioning similarly: distribution of nekton functional groups differed significantly between habitat types with greater percentages of benthic-oriented species at unterraced open water habitats and higher percentage of open water species in terraced ponds as compared to unterraced ponds, and two of the six numerically dominant fish species had greater weight-length relationships in unterraced ponds as compared to terraced ponds. This lack of functional equivalency may be attributed to environmental differences between terraced and unterraced ponds such as water depth or SAV biomass, or the relatively young age of the terraces studied, which may not have allowed for the development of some critical habitat variables, such as soil organic matter that was found to be significantly lower in terraced versus unterraced ponds (p < 0.05). To properly assess the ecological equivalency of restored or rehabilitated sites for nekton requires that we move beyond measures of nekton density, biomass, and diversity and incorporate measures of functional equivalency, including habitat measures.",10.1007/BF03036518,NA,La Peyre_2007_90075014,"La Peyre, Megan K.; Gossman, Bryan; Nyman, John A."
JOUR,90074835,2016, Europe," Govers, Gerard",author_04,Controls on soil organic carbon stocks in tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient,"Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.",10.5194/bg-13-6611-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006355608&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6611-2016&partnerID=40&md5=7655f8f0776015827d9fb54deb45e299,Van de Broek_2016_90074835,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Temmerman, Stijn; Merckx, Roel; Govers, Gerard"
JOUR,90075086,2018, Europe," Govers, Gerard",author_06,Long-term organic carbon sequestration in tidal marsh sediments is dominated by old-aged allochthonous inputs in a macrotidal estuary,"Tidal marshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that are often considered as hot-spots of atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.",10.1111/gcb.14089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042585405&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14089&partnerID=40&md5=ca6b3949132cd145c5ff964e9c7784b3,Van de Broek_2018_90075086,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Vandendriessche, Caroline; Poppelmonde, Dries; Merckx, Roel; Temmerman, Stijn; Govers, Gerard"

Reducing the current uncertainty on the amount of OC stored these sediments requires the analysis of a large number of sediment samples. Soil sensing techniques, using mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been proven to be a valid alternative for standard OC measurements in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the application of these techniques to tidal marsh sediments has been very limited and the error associated with calculated sedimentary OC stocks using MIR spectroscopy/PLSR data has up till now not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the potential of MIR spectroscopy/PLSR to predict the OC concentration and OC stock of tidal marsh sediments in a temperate estuary (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and The Netherlands). Based on a cross -validation procedure, the results show that MIR spectroscopy/PLSR predicts the OC concentration of tidal marsh sediments along the entire estuary with a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.56% OC). Similar accuracies were obtained for the prediction of sedimentary OC concentrations from independent tidal marshes. Organic carbon concentrations from tidal marshes in the salt portion of the estuary were, however, predicted more accurately using a PLSR model trained exclusively with sediment samples from this salinity zone. Combining depth profiles of predicted OC concentrations with measured bulk densities resulted in predictions of total OC stocks with a relative error < 4% for freshwater and brackish marshes, while errors for salt marshes were up to 30%. As MIR spectroscopy/PLSR is not able to accurately predict bulk density or OC density, standard field measurements of bulk density remain necessary to reliably predict sedimentary OC stocks in tidal marshes.",10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.051,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054596541&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.09.051&partnerID=40&md5=6e5871354dd3ddd37dfcc8f0cc5bfae9,Van de Broek_2019_90075479,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Govers, Gerard"

A number of factors contribute to this loss of habitat, including the activities of herbivores. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of large mammals, predominantly nutria and wild boar, on processes controlling soil elevation in coastal marshes.2 Effects of herbivores on soil and vegetation were assessed by the use of paired fenced and unfenced plots over two successive growing seasons. Above-ground biomass, Litter production, changes in soil elevation, vertical soil accretion, shallow subsidence, below-ground production of roots and rhizomes, the thickness of the root zone, soil bulk density, and soil organic matter were measured.3 Above-ground biomass, below-ground production, soil elevation and the expansion of the root zone decreased due to herbivore activity. Litter production, the rate of soil surface accretion and shallow soil subsidence were all higher in grazed compared to unrated plots, while soil organic matter and bulk density did not differ significantly between treatments.4 The results indicate that herbivores can have a negative effect on soil building processes, primarily by reducing below-ground production and expansion of the root zone. Where natural rates of mineral sediment deposition are high, coastal marshes are expected to persist, despite herbivore activities.

In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). The distribution of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter. They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity). Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake. Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens. The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland. Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions. We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake. Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community. The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials.

Within this framework, the effects of environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43% of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs.

Community composition and DEA were highly variable within the dynamic salt marsh system, but each was strongly affected by elevation (i.e., degree of inundation) and carbon content as well as by selected metals. Carbon content was highly related to elevation, and the relationships between DEA and carbon content were found to be elevation specific when evaluated across the entire marsh.

JOUR,90075227,2020, Europe," Guise, L.",author_04,Bromine biogeodynamics in the NE Atlantic: A perspective from natural wetlands of western Portugal,"Bromine (Br) cycling in natural wetlands is highly complex, including abiotic/biotic processes and multiphase inorganic/organic Br-species. Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the western most fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br-) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8-75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3-13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8-13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1-8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br- rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111-253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br-] of interstitial waters (129 mu g/L-79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1-508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14-173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic ""model"". As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br- upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems.

However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

In this study, C-13 labeling was used for exploring allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in Phragmites australis -soil system undergoing the salt marsh restoration project by freshwater pumping in Yellow River Estuary (YRE), China. Samples were collected from T-0 (before labeling) to 90 days after labeling (T-4), in natural salt marsh, 5-, 10- and 15-year freshwater pumping areas, respectively.

Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the East Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2 to 16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: 1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, 2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and 3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands.

These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50-70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding.

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1).

Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of similar to 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger OC stocks (175-504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44-271 Mg/ha). Variation in OC stocks among nonriverine sites was high in comparison with riverine and mixed geomorphic settings, with sites closer to riverine outflow from the east and south of Moreton Bay having higher stocks than those located on the sand islands in the northwest of the bay. Sediment OC stocks increased with elevation within nonriverine settings, but not in riverine geomorphic settings. Sediment OC stocks did not differ between mangrove and saltmarsh habitats.

Four modern transects collected from three tidal environments at Siletz Bay, Oregon, USA, produced three elevation-dependent groups in both the foraminiferal and delta C-13/bulk geochemistry datasets. Foraminiferal samples from the tidal flat and low marsh are identified by Miliammina fusca abundances of >45%, middle and high marsh by M. fusca abundances of <45% and the highest marsh by Trochamminita irregularis abundances >25%. The delta C-13 values from the groups defined with delta C-13/bulk geochemistry analyses decrease with an increasing elevation; -24.1 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand in the tidal flat and low marsh; -27.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand in the middle and high marsh; and -29.6 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand in the highest marsh samples. We applied the modern foraminiferal and delta C-13 distributions to a core that contained a stratigraphic contact marking the great Cascadia earthquake of AD 1700. Both techniques gave similar values for coseismic subsidence across the contact (0.88 +/- 0.39 m and 0.71 +/- 0.56 m) suggesting that delta C-13 has potential for identifying amounts of relative sea-level change due to tectonics.

We compared our diatom dataset (320 species from 104 samples) to a series of environmental variables (elevation, grain-size, total organic carbon (TOCSOM), and porewater salinity) using hierarchical clustering and ordination. While no single variable consistently explains variations in diatom assemblages at every site, elevation, salinity, and substrate (mud fraction and (TOCSOM) are variables affecting diatom distribution along our transects. Elevation was the major environmental control of diatom variability (explained 27-39% variance) at four transects (Bone River Transect 1, Niawiakum River Transect 2, Naselle River Transect 1 and 2).

A multi-method biogeochemical study,"Coastal wetlands in Louisiana experience high rates of edge erosion due to combined eustatic sea level rise and coastal subsidence. This study sought to (1) evaluate site-specific spatial and temporal patterns in marsh edge erosion rates within Barataria Bay, LA, (2) develop an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of eroding soils through biogeochemical and spectroscopic characterization, and (3) evaluate interactions between erosion, saltwater incursion, and soil properties through a comparison of sites with different erosion rates and varying distances from the eroding edge. Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively. Neither erosional magnitude nor saltwater incursion was found to be significant predictors of any measured spectroscopic or biogeochemical parameters, though depth was a significant control on 18 of the measured 20 parameters. The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion. This study is the first to couple spectroscopic and biogeochemical measurements for the purpose of assessing soil and porewater physicochemistry within wetland soils and illustrates an as-yet unaccounted for potential for the export of labile C, N, and P into the coastal ocean.",10.1016/j.catena.2019.104373,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076620267&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104373&partnerID=40&md5=824421bab70bad93b66658398eb04353,Steinmuller_2020_90074274,"Steinmuller, Havalend E.; Hayes, Michael P.; Hurst, Nia R.; Sapkota, Yadav; Cook, Robert L.; White, John R.; Xue, Zuo; Chambers, Lisa G."

Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top - 0-20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water.

The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.",10.1007/s11368-018-2177-y,NA,Sun_2019_90074631,"Sun, Zhigao; Li, Jiabing; He, Tao; Tian, Liping; Li, Jing; Li, Xiao"

Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles. Heavy metal levels in sediments of the Min River estuary were much higher compared with most estuaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern. Both Ni and Pb in sediments of the intertidal zone showed high potential toxicity and high contributions to the sum of the toxic units (Sigma TUs).

In particular, the environmental characteristics of tidal marshes show are different than those of bare flats, especially in the rhizosphere. However, unlike the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, the rhizosphere of plants in tidal marsh areas and the associated microbial community have been the focus of very little research. Thus, this study investigated the diversity and variation in bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of a Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica and along the sediment depths. High-throughput sequencing was performed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene of environmental DNA extracted from sediment cores, and indicator species were identified with respect to the vegetation type and sediment depth. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes. In general, the results indicated that not only vegetation type and sediment depth themselves but also their interaction resulted in significant differences among the bacterial communities. The envfit results revealed that the environmental variables of sediment, such as mud content, organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The indicator species varied depending on the vegetation type and sediment depth, showing significant correlations with certain selected environmental variables, but were fundamentally related to the rhizosphere. Overall, this study revealed the key factors that determine the bacterial community structure in tidal marshes and the indicator species according to vegetation type in the little studied rhizosphere of the intertidal ecosystem.

Previous studies reported that the invasion alters biogeochemical and microbial processes in marsh ecosystems, yet our knowledge of changing archaeal community due to the invasion is still limited, whereas archaeal communities play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles within highly reduced marsh soils. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the influences of the Spartina anglica invasion on soil archaeal community and the depth profile of the influences. The relative abundance of archaeal phyla demonstrated that the invasion substantially shifted the characteristics of tidal salt marsh from marine to terrestrial soil only in surface layer, while the influences indirectly propagated to the deeper soil layer. In particular, two archaeal phyla, Asgardaeota and Diapherotrites, were strongly influenced by the invasion, indicating a shift from marine to terrestrial archaeal communities. The shifts in soil characteristics spread to the deeper soil layer that results in indirect propagation of the influences of the invasion down to the deeper soil, which was underestimated in previous studies. The changes in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and salinity were the substantial regulating factors for that. Therefore, changes in biogeochemical and microbial characteristics in the deep soil layer, which is below the root zone of the invasive plant, should be accounted for a more accurate illustration of the consequences of the invasion.",10.1007/s00248-021-01770-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106309694&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-021-01770-3&partnerID=40&md5=695f59d5b10f519b52ce278c7d064d62,Kim_2021_90075352,"Kim, Jinhyun; Heo, Young Mok; Yun, Jeongeun; Lee, Hanbyul; Kim, Jae-Jin; Kang, Hojeong"

However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.",10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b,Luis Marin-Muniz_2014_90074521,"Luis Marin-Muniz, Jose; Hernandez, Maria E.; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine species-level responses to 12 sea-level rise scenarios. Both hydrologic regime (-10, +5, and +20 cm flooding depth) and salinity level (fresh, 2%o, 4%o, and 6%o) were interactively manipulated. Within these various sea-level rise scenarios, we sought to determine the effects of hydrologic regime, salinity level, and the interaction of these two stresses on the productivity of Panicum hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Spartina patens, which are dominant macrophytes of fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh types, respectively, in coastal Louisiana and the southeastern coastal plain. We found that altered hydrologic regimes and increased salinity levels differentially affected edaphic conditions and species-level productivity. Increases in flooding depth were most detrimental to S. patens. Salinity levels greater than 4%o resulted in mortality of P. hemitomon, and salinity levels of 6%o resulted in reduced growth and eventual death of S. lancifolia. The effects of elevated salinity levels on P. hemitomon and S. lancifolia were exacerbated when coupled with increased flooding levels. Although soil organic matter was shown to increase in all vegetative conditions, increases were dependent upon the productivity of the species under the different hydrologic regimes and salinity levels with P. hemitomon displaying tremendous potential to increase soil organic matter under fresh conditions, especially when coupled with moderate flooding.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone is an area where range limits and ecotone dynamics can be studied in tandem as recent decreases in winter temperature extremes have allowed for mangrove expansion at the expense of salt marsh. In this study, we assessed aboveground and belowground plant-soil dynamics across the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone quantifying micro-spatial patterns in horizontal extent. Specifically, we studied vegetation and rooting dynamics of large and small trees, the impact of salt marshes (e.g. species and structure) on mangroves, and the influence of vegetation on soil properties along transects from underneath the mangrove canopy into the surrounding salt marsh. Vegetation and rooting dynamics differed in horizontal reach, and there was a positive relationship between mangrove tree height and rooting extent. We found that the horizontal expansion of mangrove roots into salt marsh extended up to eight meters beyond the aboveground boundary. Variation in vegetation structure and local hydrology appear to control mangrove seedling dynamics. Finally, soil carbon density and organic matter did not differ within locations across the salt marsh-mangrove interface.

JOUR,90074509,2021,NA," Hidalgo-Martinez, Silvia",author_04,Bioturbation has a limited effect on phosphorus burial in salt marsh sediments,"It has been hypothesized that the evolution of animals during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition stimulated the burial of phosphorus in marine sediments. This assumption is centrally based on data compilations from marine sediments deposited under oxic and anoxic bottom waters. Since anoxia excludes the presence of infauna and sediment reworking, the observed differences in P burial are assumed to be driven by the presence of bioturbators. This reasoning however ignores the potentially confounding impact of bottom-water oxygenation on phosphorus burial. Here, our goal is to test the idea that bioturbation increases the burial of organic and inorganic phosphorus (P-org and P-inorg, respectively) while accounting for bottom-water oxygenation. We present solid-phase phosphorus speciation data from salt marsh ponds with and without bioturbation (Blakeney salt marsh, Norfolk, UK). In both cases, the pond sediments are exposed to oxygenated bottom waters, and so the only difference is the presence or absence of bioturbating macrofauna. Our data reveal that the rate of P-org and P-inorg burial are indistinguishable between bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments. A large terrestrial fraction of organic matter and higher sedimentation velocity than generally found in marine sediments (0.3 +/- 0.1 cm yr(-1)) may partially impact these results. However, the absence of a clear effect of bioturbation on total P burial puts into question the presumed importance of bioturbation for phosphorus burial.",10.5194/bg-18-1451-2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101596636&doi=10.5194%2fbg-18-1451-2021&partnerID=40&md5=1d559f309df011b2130018097a487272,van de Velde_2021_90074509,"van de Velde, Sebastiaan J.; James, Rebecca K.; Callebaut, Ine; Hidalgo-Martinez, Silvia; Meysman, Filip J.

Organic carbon and total nitrogen measurements, as well as sequential phosphorus extractions ('SEDEX') were performed on these pond sediments. In August 2018, 4 ponds with benthic fauna and 4 ponds without benthic fauna (2 replicates each) were sampled. Organic carbon, total nitrogen, total and inorganic phosphorus measurements were performed on these sediments. Plant material was collected in August 2018 and analyzed for total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents.

Fertilization with nitrogen led to some significant changes in marsh processes, specifically increases in aboveground primary production and in CO2 fluxes from the soil. However, neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss (relative to controls), reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production, all of which have been proposed as links between elevated nutrient loads and marsh drowning. Our data suggest that high nutrient levels increase gross carbon loss from the sediment, but that this is compensated for by other processes, leading to no net deleterious effect of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability with respect to sea level rise.",10.1007/s12237-011-9440-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855246309&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-011-9440-4&partnerID=40&md5=75cfcf21eb00536a86773e52762483f4,Anisfeld_2012_90075443,"Anisfeld, Shimon C.; Hill, Troy D."
JOUR,90075449,2016,NA," Hill, Troy D.",author_03,Submergence and Herbivory as Divergent Causes of Marsh Loss in Long Island Sound,"Tidal marsh degradation has been attributed to a number of different causes, but few studies have examined multiple potential factors at the same sites. Differentiating the diverse drivers of marsh loss is critical to prescribing successful interventions for conservation and restoration of this important habitat. We evaluated two hypotheses for vegetation loss at two marshes in Long Island Sound (LIS): (1) marsh submergence, caused by an imbalance between sea-level rise and marsh accretion, and (2) defoliation associated with herbivory by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum. At our western LIS site, we found no evidence of herbivory: crabs were scarce, and crab-exclusion cages provided no benefit. We attribute degradation at that site to submergence, a conclusion supported by topographic and hydrologic data showing that loss of vegetation occurred only in wetter parts of the marsh. In contrast, at our central LIS site, our observations were consistent with herbivory as a driving force: There were substantial populations of Sesarma, crab-exclusion cages allowed plants to thrive, and vegetation loss took place across a variety of elevations. We also analyzed soil conditions at both sites, in order to determine the signatures of different degradation processes and assess the potential for restoration. At the submergence site, unvegetated soils exhibited high bulk density, low organic content, and low soil strength, posing significant biogeochemical challenges to re-colonization by vegetation. At the herbivory site, unvegetated soils had a characteristic ""riddled-peat"" appearance, resulting from expansion and erosion of Sesarma burrow networks. The high redox potential and organic content of those soils suggested that revegetation at the herbivory site would be likely if Sesarma populations could be controlled before erosion leads to elevation loss.",10.1007/s12237-016-0080-6,NA,Schultz_2016_90075449,"Schultz, Rebecca A.; Anisfeld, Shimon C.; Hill, Troy D."

Ross",author_04,Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh,"Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts.

Within this framework, the effects of environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43% of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs.

The objective of this study was to examine how microbial community composition and denitrification enzyme activities (DEA) at a California salt marsh with high nutrient loading vary with such factors. Sediments were sampled from three elevations, each with different inundation and vegetation patterns, across 12 stations representing various salinity and nutrient conditions. Analyses included determination of cell abundance, total and denitrifier community compositions (by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism), DEA, nutrients, and eluted metals. Total bacterial (16S rRNA) and denitrifier (nirS) community compositions and DEA were analyzed for their relationships to environmental variables and metal concentrations via multivariate direct gradient and regression analyses, respectively. Community composition and DEA were highly variable within the dynamic salt marsh system, but each was strongly affected by elevation (i.e., degree of inundation) and carbon content as well as by selected metals. Carbon content was highly related to elevation, and the relationships between DEA and carbon content were found to be elevation specific when evaluated across the entire marsh. There were also lateral gradients in the marsh, as evidenced by an even stronger association between community composition and elevation for a marsh subsystem.

Organic analysis utilized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) for PAHs, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) for pesticides and PCBs. Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks. The spatial distribution of organic contaminants was evaluated in four of these tidal creek-salt marsh systems representing urban/industrial, suburban, and forested watersheds, from, the creek channel. to the adjacent uplands. The distribution of organic contaminants within each representative creek was not concordant with the total organic carbon or the clay content of the sediment. The representative industrial/urban creek-marsh system, Diesel Creek, had the highest concentration of PAHs in the creek channel and the highest concentration of PCBs and DDT on the marsh surface, primarily in the upper portion of the system, The representative suburban creek-marsh system, Shem Creek, had elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs throughout the entire system. This system also had one site with a total PAH concentration of 324,000 ppb and a total DDT concentration that was 20-100 times higher than the other sites. One of the representative forested creek-marsh systems, Rathall Creek, had low levels of the three organic contaminants except for one sampling site that had PAH concentrations a factor of 10 higher than the other sites. The other representative forested creek-marsh system, Long Creek, bad low levels of PAHs and PCBs, but elevated levels of DDT were observed, particularly in the upper portion on the marsh surface. The results of this study suggest that (1) anthropogenic alteration of the land cover in the watersheds of tidal creek-salt marsh systems may increase the organic contaminant loadings in the sediment, and (2) tidal creek-salt marsh sediments, particularly in the creek channel, are repositories and potentially conduits of organic contaminants from the upland environment to the deeper estuarine areas.",10.1007/s002449900540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032704089&doi=10.1007%2fs002449900540&partnerID=40&md5=8bdae7112737384c311e397322b241df,Sanger_1999_90075158,"Sanger, D.M.; Holland, A.F.; Scott, G.I."

The particle size and total organic carbon (TOC) content of creek sediments in developed watersheds (i.e., industrial, urban, and suburban) were similar to that in watersheds with little or no development (i.e., forested or reference). Those trace metals commonly associated with urban and industrial sources, including Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg, were in significantly higher concentrations in tidal creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds compared to the suburban and forested watersheds. Sediment trace metal concentrations were similar for creeks located in suburban and forested watersheds and 2 to 10 times lower than the creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds. Concentrations of trace metals primarily associated with the natural weathering of basement rock, including Al, Fe, As, Ni, and Mn, were not significantly different among watershed types. Four of the tidal creek-salt marsh systems were extensively sampled from the creek channel to the marsh-upland interface to characterize sediment trace metal spatial distributions within creek-marsh systems. Sediment particle size, TOC, and trace metal concentrations varied spatially within each creek-marsh system depending on the type of development in the watershed and the probable source of metals.

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time.

We described modern diatom distributions from seven transects covering unvegetated subtidal environments to forested uplands from four tidal wetland sites (Smith Creek, Bone River, Niawiakum River, and Naselle River) of Willapa Bay, Washington, USA. We compared our diatom dataset (320 species from 104 samples) to a series of environmental variables (elevation, grain-size, total organic carbon (TOCSOM), and porewater salinity) using hierarchical clustering and ordination. While no single variable consistently explains variations in diatom assemblages at every site, elevation, salinity, and substrate (mud fraction and (TOCSOM) are variables affecting diatom distribution along our transects. Elevation was the major environmental control of diatom variability (explained 27-39% variance) at four transects (Bone River Transect 1, Niawiakum River Transect 2, Naselle River Transect 1 and 2). Salinity and substrate were the major environmental controls (explained 12-32% variance) of diatom variability at three transects (Niawiakum River Transect 1: salinity; Smith Creek Transect and Bone River Transect 2: (TOCSOM). Analyses of a combined regional dataset of all transects suggest that elevation is the driver of regional diatom variability in Willapa Bay, with salinity and substrate co-varying along an elevation gradient.

However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively.

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1).

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox).

Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) also play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively.

The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge.

The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil.

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

JOUR,90074408,2020, Europe," Ibanez, Carles",author_07,Carbon metabolic rates and GHG emissions in different wetland types of the Ebro Delta,"Deltaic wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which characteristically can act as C-sinks. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220-250 g C m(-2) y(-1)), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m(-2) y(-1)). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the 16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions.",10.1371/journal.pone.0231713,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083737412&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0231713&partnerID=40&md5=8d90326918c11467695eb13ab328edb9,Morant_2020_90074408,"Morant, Daniel; Picazo, Antonio; Rochera, Carlos; Santamans, Anna C.; Miralles-Lorenzo, Javier; Camacho-Santamans, Alba; Ibanez, Carles; Martinez-Eixarch, Maite; Camacho, Antonio"

Benthic foraminiferal palaeoassemblages and sediment characteristics of five short cores were used to reconstruct past wetland habitats, through application of multivariate DCA and CONISS techniques, and dissimilarity coefficients (SCD). The timing of environmental changes was compared to known natural and anthropogenic events in order to identify their possible relationships. In deltaic wetlands under altered hydrological conditions, we found a decrease in species diversity and calcareous-dominated assemblages, and a significant positive correlation between microfaunal changes and organic matter content. Modern analogues supported palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the recent evolution of the Delta wetlands. This research provides the first recent reconstruction of change in the Ebro Delta wetlands, and also illustrates the importance of benthic foraminifera for biomonitoring present and future conditions in Mediterranean deltas.

Moreover, the individual- and population-level traits of ecosystem engineers can affect their ability to reduce environmental stress. On the Patagonian shores of Argentina (SW Atlantic, 41 degrees S), the intertidal community is exposed to harsh conditions. We predicted that in this severe environment, variation in the above-ground structure of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora should buffer the physical stress on the substrate through shading and reduction of wind and water flow energy, ultimately affecting the sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated cordgrass density at the edge and inner marsh of a S. alterniflora meadow during both summer and winter. In summer, evaporation and temperature were higher in clipped plots, while in winter, evaporation varied across densities and location treatments, with higher sediment water content in the inner marsh. No effect of S. alterniflora density or location were observed on sediment organic matter or chl a concentration, and mean sediment grain size was always smaller inside the marsh. In summer, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content was higher in clipped plots inside the marsh, however this did not differ from the other density treatments at this location. Overall, shading had weak effects on sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass, and most observed differences were attributable to grain size. We speculate that the harsh conditions of this system overwhelm the ecosystem engineering effects of S. alterniflora, probably because of its relatively small above-ground biomass.",10.3354/meps11726,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971246238&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11726&partnerID=40&md5=b79109b413f82e2137bfa4c3e270b6e4,Firstater_2016_90074259,"Firstater, Fausto N.; Narvarte, Maite; Fernanda Alvarez, M.; Eugenia Fanjul, M.; Iribarne, Oscar O."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.",10.1007/s12237-018-00509-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062156523&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-00509-7&partnerID=40&md5=bee9157c89805f2ee696b3f96de53fff,Montemayor_2019_90074984,"Montemayor, Diana I.; Canepuccia, Alejandro D.; Farina, Juan; Addino, Mariana; Valinas, Macarena; Iribarne, Oscar O."

Here, we studied the effects of the black fire ant Solenopsis richteri on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests. Samplings and transplant experiments showed that plants growing in contact with mounds grew longer, had wider stems and higher root biomass than plants apart from mounds. These results indicate that by affecting sediment characteristics, ants indirectly and positively affect plants condition, with potential cascading up effects on community structure and dynamics. Because mounds are relocated every similar to 3.5 months, bioturbation impacts may extend over time through the whole high marsh, highlighting the role that black fire ants may have in the ecology of southwestern Atlantic marshes.",10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107534,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112448741&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107534&partnerID=40&md5=9f845a7ab70919f894e17f0d1aa24c7b,Hidalgo_2021_90075197,"Hidalgo, Fernando J.; Canepuccia, Alejandro D.; Arcusa, Juan; Fanjul, Eugenia; Alvarez, Graciela; Iribarne, Oscar O."

In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition.

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.",10.1007/s11104-019-04184-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068345721&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-019-04184-w&partnerID=40&md5=ef8141da46ef38599b2acb312020dbd7,Yang_2019_90075390,"Yang, Wen; Jeelani, Nasreen; Xia, Lu; Zhu, Zhihong; Luo, Yiqi; Cheng, Xiaoli; An, Shuqing"

Glucose addition (C source) elicited a transitory increase in microbial biomass.

The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth.2 In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of (NH4Cl)-N-15 into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial N-15 excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of N-15. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated N-15 such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils.3 The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer.4 Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of N-15 in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion.5 Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01214.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846906490&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2745.2007.01214.x&partnerID=40&md5=24d5f8f0d1a0172b558772001ed0f87c,Buckeridge_2007_90074728,"Buckeridge, Kate M.; Jefferies, Robert L."

Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock.

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.",10.1002/ecs2.2556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010,Mueller_2019_90074609,"Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"
JOUR,90075078,2016,NA," Jensen, Kai",author_02,Plants mediate soil organic matter decomposition in response to sea level rise,"Tidal marshes have a large capacity for producing and storing organic matter, making their role in the global carbon budget disproportionate to land area. Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.",10.1111/gcb.13082,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954167983&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13082&partnerID=40&md5=51d641e0070edfb33c81a56c69408984,Mueller_2016_90075078,"Mueller, Peter; Jensen, Kai; Megonigal, James Patrick"
JOUR,90075095,2017,NA," Jensen, Kai",author_07,Data from: Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils,"Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

JOUR,90075284,2017, Europe," Jensen, Kai",author_05,Factors influencing the organic carbon pools in tidal marsh soils of the Elbe estuary (Germany),"Purpose Soils of tidal marshes play an important role in regional carbon (C) cycles as they are able to store considerable amounts of organic carbon (OC). However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.",10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266,Hansen_2017_90075284,"Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

Multivariate analysis of PLFA profiles had significantly separated the sediment microbial community composition of regional sampling sites, halophytes, rhizosphere, and bulk sediments. Sediments from Suaeda plants were characterized by higher abundance of PLFA biomarkers of Gram-negative, total bacteria, and actinomycetes than other halophytes.

Dominant halophytes such as Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides and Suaeda maritima play significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient mineralization, nutrient cycling and improving micro-environment. There are scanty reports on the rhizosphere microbial communities of halophytes. Whether the rhizosphere of halophytes harbors unique microbial communities or has species specificity is yet to be established. In the present study, we have determined microbial community structure and functional genes abundance as well as major nutrients and three key enzyme activities in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of three halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus and Suaeda) growing on salty marsh of coastal Gujarat, India. The NH4-N and available K were significantly higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil in all the cases. The rhizosphere of Suaeda was characterized by significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon, total N, NH4-N and available P as compared to other two halophytes. The rhizopsheric soil had significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve and total bacterial PLFA biomarkers compared to the bulk soil. Among halophytes, significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs were recorded in Suaeda and Aeluropus in comparison to Salicornia. The NMS analysis of PLFA profiles revealed a significant difference in microbial community structure in Salicornia compared to Aeluropus and Suaeda. Similarly, rhizosphere microbial community structure of Salicornia was significantly different from Suaeda and Aeluropus. In rhizosphere soils, significantly higher abundance (molar%) of GM-ve, GM +ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs were observed in Aeluropus and Suaeda compared to Salicornia. Activities of beta-glucosidase and urease were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. The abundance of 16S rRNA, cbbL and nifH genes, detected by the quantitative RT-PCR was significantly varied among soils and halophytes. The results exhibited high bacterial diversity, abundance of CO2 and N-fixing bacteria, which can be explored further for their role in C and N cycling for sustainable agriculture and environment management.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption.

Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3.

However, little information is available on the relationship between hydrologic conditions and denitrification. In this study three typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including short-term flooding wetlands (STFW), seasonal-flooding wetlands (SFW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) were chosen as the study sites in the Yellow River Delta. In contrast, five typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including 100-year floodplain (H), 10-year floodplain (T), 5-year floodplain (F), 1-year floodplain (O) and permanently flooded floodplain (B) were chosen as the study sites in Xianghai wetlands. This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes. Generally, higher flooding frequencies will cause higher denitrification rates in salt marshes. Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes. Therefore, the changes in soil properties (e.g. SOM, TN, pH and salinity) can become an important way to control NO3- levels in inland salt marshes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We applied allometric function, exponential function and logistic function to model the depth distribution of the SOCv and SOCc for each salt marsh, respectively. The results showed that the exponential function fits the depth distribution of the SOCv more well than other two functions. The SOCc can be fitted very well by all three functions for three salt marsh (Adj. R-2 > 0.99), of which the allometric function was the best one. The mean topsoil concentration factors (TCFs) of three salt marshes were beyond 0.1, which means the SOC enrichment in surface soils due to plant cycling, but TCFs in PSM were significantly higher than those in SSM (P < 0.05). Nearly 30% of SOC was concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.",10.1038/srep34835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990817882&doi=10.1038%2fsrep34835&partnerID=40&md5=24912372ff0e19e750b300a353200145,Bai_2016_90075381,"Bai, Junhong; Zhang, Guangliang; Zhao, Qingqing; Lu, Qiongqiong; Jia, Jia; Cui, Baoshan; Liu, Xinhui"

Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion.

Our results showed that there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils among the five sampling sites (p > 0.05), whereas significant differences were observed between June and other months (p < 0.05) following the order June > August > November > April. Generally, available phosphorus (AP) contents also showed a fluctuation in different sampling periods and there were significant differences between November and August and April at 10-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). The soil P supply was generally lower with lower AP:TP ratios less than 2%. Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter.

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107433584&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107875&partnerID=40&md5=c57f77f001595b38968fd0652dc8bd4f,Cui_2021_90074357,"Cui, Lina; Sun, Huimin; Du, Xuhua; Feng, Wenting; Wang, Yugang; Zhang, Jinchi; Jiang, Jiang"

The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production.

The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis.

Invasion of S. alterniflora altered the environmental properties. With the increase of invasion age, the coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content tended to increase, whereas chlorophyll a and salinity tended to decrease. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the habitats were separated along the gradient of the invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and salinity were the most important characters for habitat differentiation because the PCA biplot illustrated that the vectors of these environmental properties involved the smaller angles with PC 1. Based on a two-way ANOVA analysis, invasion stage of S. alterniflora and season significantly affected the density of A. latericea (p < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (p = 0. 226). The density of A. latericea varied significantly among seasons in each habitat based on a one-way ANOVA analysis, except in the bare mudflat without invasion. The highest densities occurred at the mature invasion stage in autumn, whereas the lowest densities occurred with no invasion in spring. Both Taylor's and Iwao's regressions indicated that A. latericea presented an aggregated distribution pattern (p < 0.001). The consistent distribution pattern indicated that it might be a biological trait of the species. Based on stepwise regression analysis, stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content were selected for the optimal regression model. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion altered the environment of the coast and variation in A. latericea density was a response of the species to the environmental change caused by S. alterniflora invasion.

J.",author_03,"Storage of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil-plant system of Phragmites australis stands from a eutrophicated Mediterranean salt marsh","In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

Species cover, soil salinity, and the groundwater level were monitored between 1991 and 1993 and between 2002 and 2004, and total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrates, ammonium and exchangeable phosphorus were measured in the soils in both study periods. In addition, three soil profiles were described in August 1992 and August 2004. The results indicate an elevation of the water table throughout the 13-year period, which was attributable to water flowing from areas with intensive agriculture. Flooding increased and soil salinity dropped in the most saline sites and increased in the least saline ones. The morphology of the soil profiles reflected the increase in flooding periods, clue to the appearance of a greyer matrix in the deeper horizons and a more diffuse pattern of Fe mottles. Following these environmental changes, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Phragmites australis and Juncus maritimus strongly expanded at the wettest sites, which led to the disappearance of the original zonation pattern. The cover of Limonium delicatulum, in turn, decreased with the increase in moisture but increased following the increase in salinity. Changes in soil nutrients were only very evident in the sandy soils of the beach, probably due to the influence of organic debris deposited on the shoreline by the storms and due to the strong increase in the colonisation of this habitat by perennial species. According to the results obtained, control measures are needed in order to preserve habitat diversity in this and other salt marshes of this area. Monitoring of the vegetation distribution could be a useful tool to identify environmental impacts, in order to implement remedial actions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size. Thus, local input and increased phytoplankton production will play a more important role in the carbon dynamics in this coastal area in the future.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.",10.1016/j.csr.2018.01.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044392821&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d734e5a4562b0512ae5146a564922539,Loh_2018_90075224,"Loh, Pei Sun; Cheng, Long-Xiu; Yuan, Hong-Wei; Yang, Lin; Lou, Zhang-Hua; Jin, Ai-Min; Chen, Xue-Gang; Lin, Yu-Shih; Chen, Chen-Tung Arthur"

Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114035745&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2021.120503&partnerID=40&md5=a10c600910c714f7cee95362bb10ec77,Costa_2021_90074624,"Costa, Larissa; Johannesson, Karen; Mirlean, Nicolai; Quintana, Guilherme"

Sediment cores (ca. 60 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in As content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominated). Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores.

Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.",10.1890/10-2037.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051955666&doi=10.1890%2f10-2037.1&partnerID=40&md5=e96b2c3ff336749aa1cda07f28f373eb,Davey_2011_90074559,"Davey, Earl; Wigand, Cathleen; Johnson, Roxanne; Sundberg, Karen; Morris, James; Roman, Charles T."

CO2 emission rates at the fertilized Goat Island plots were similar in magnitude to the upper Debidue and significantly greater than the Goat Island control plots and the reference Crab Haul Creek.

We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing.

In this study, the impact of grazing upon the size, composition and activity of the soil microbial community was measured in field experiments in two coastal ecosystems: one salt marsh and one sand dune grassland. Bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass were not systematically affected by grazing across ecosystems, although, within an ecosystem, differences could be detected. Fungal-to-bacterial ratio did not differ with grazing for either habitat. Redundancy analysis showed that soil moisture, bulk density and root biomass significantly explained the composition of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers, dominated by the distinction between the two grassland habitats, but where the grazing effect could also be resolved. PLFA markers for Gram-positive bacteria were more proportionally abundant in un-grazed, and markers for Gram-negative bacteria in grazed grasslands. Bacterial growth rate (leucine incorporation) was highest in un-grazed salt marsh but did not vary with grazing intensity in the sand dune grassland. We conclude that grazing consistently affects the composition of the soil microbial community in semi-natural grasslands but that its influence is small (7 % of the total variation in PLFA composition), compared with differences between grassland types (89 %). The relatively small effect of grazing translated to small effects on measurements of soil microbial functions, including N and C mineralisation. This study is an early step toward assessing consequences of land-use change for global nutrient cycles driven by the microbial community.",10.1007/s00374-012-0721-2,NA,Ford_2013_90074743,"Ford, H.; Rousk, J.; Garbutt, A.; Jones, L.; Jones, D.

L.",author_04,Carbon sequestration and biogeochemical cycling in a saltmarsh Subject to coastal managed realignment,"Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of C-14-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we measured CH4 production potential, methanogen community structure and biogeochemical factors along a coastal wetland transect comprised of five habitat regions: open water, bare tidal flat, invasive S. alterniflora marsh and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis marshes. CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.",10.1007/s00248-018-1168-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043696170&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-018-1168-2&partnerID=40&md5=bec71221eea542c930e65bb8a699eb16,Kim_2018_90075017,"Kim, Sunghyun; Kang, Jiyoung; Megonigal, J.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period.

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.",10.1038/s41586-019-0951-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062585818&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-019-0951-7&partnerID=40&md5=4b44efb7fab903f4cd8991016a2c167d,Rogers_2019_90075480,"Rogers, Kerrylee; Kelleway, Jeffrey J.; Saintilan, Neil; Megonigal, J.

In particular, the environmental characteristics of tidal marshes show are different than those of bare flats, especially in the rhizosphere. However, unlike the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, the rhizosphere of plants in tidal marsh areas and the associated microbial community have been the focus of very little research. Thus, this study investigated the diversity and variation in bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of a Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica and along the sediment depths. High-throughput sequencing was performed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene of environmental DNA extracted from sediment cores, and indicator species were identified with respect to the vegetation type and sediment depth. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes. In general, the results indicated that not only vegetation type and sediment depth themselves but also their interaction resulted in significant differences among the bacterial communities. The envfit results revealed that the environmental variables of sediment, such as mud content, organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The indicator species varied depending on the vegetation type and sediment depth, showing significant correlations with certain selected environmental variables, but were fundamentally related to the rhizosphere. Overall, this study revealed the key factors that determine the bacterial community structure in tidal marshes and the indicator species according to vegetation type in the little studied rhizosphere of the intertidal ecosystem.

Empirical evidence of C release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare, yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes. Here we investigated the stability of salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora) sediment C levels following seagrass (Thallasia testudinum) wrack accumulation; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes. At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term 'refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0069244,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879983342&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0069244&partnerID=40&md5=fb2f0fb9a1b05349d291728ecad70fba,Macreadie_2013_90074722,"Macreadie, Peter I.; Hughes, A.

Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables.

Marsh migration represents a primary mechanism for marsh survival in the face of sea-level rise and leads to a fundamental reorganization of vegetation communities. Yet, the ecological implications of these changes remain unknown. To evaluate the effect of marsh migration on ecosystem function, we compared habitat, primary production, vertical accretion, nutrient cycling, and carbon accumulation between new and old salt marsh on Goodwin Island (Virginia, USA) where salt marsh is migrating landward into rapidly retreating coastal forest. Using historical imagery and radioisotopic dating of sediment cores, we determined marsh age (< 3 to approximately 616 years) across the landscape. We found that salt marsh functions generally depended more on elevation and/or landscape position than marsh age. Primary production and nutrient cycling (%C and %N soil content) did not vary significantly with marsh age. Accretion and carbon accumulation rates varied predictably with elevation in old marsh but not in new marsh. Instead, trends in soil formation were controlled by the colonization of Phragmites australis, a dominant plant in migrating marsh-forest boundaries along the Atlantic Coast. Vegetation zonation patterns were more clearly defined in old marsh, indicating that habitat types take time to develop. However, these vegetation differences did not translate to consistently different ecological functions. These observations suggest that marsh migration does not lead to permanent differences in ecological functions between new and old marsh, rather ecological functions will converge as new marsh ages.",10.1007/s10021-021-00652-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107459073&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00652-6&partnerID=40&md5=866575392d526b60ccf2aa2f90c31024,Langston_2021_90074610,"Langston, Amy K.; Coleman, Daniel J.; Jung, Nathalie W.; Shawler, Justin L.; Smith, Alexander J.; Williams, Bethany L.; Wittyngham, Serina S.; Chambers, Randolph M.; Perry, James E.; Kirwan, Matthew L."

Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.",10.1002/ecy.2916,NA,Charles_2020_90074917,"Charles, Sean P.; Kominoski, John S.; Armitage, Anna R.; Guo, Hongyu; Weaver, Carolyn A.; Pennings, Steven C."

Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values.

JOUR,90074668,2018, Africa/Middle East," Krishnakumar, P. K.",author_05,Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf,"Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.",10.1088/1748-9326/aac899,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933,Cusack_2018_90074668,"Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.",10.1088/1748-9326/ab76da,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082665177&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fab76da&partnerID=40&md5=4689963860f62d688a0eace0d72c943e,Saderne_2020_90075237,"Saderne, V; Cusack, M.; Serrano, O.; Almahasheer, H.; Krishnakumar, P.

Sediment was incubated in jars (20-ml glass vials) and changes in porewater solutes were followed in a time series of 3 weeks. Furthermore, the short-term fate (days) of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) added to Bangrong mangrove sediment was evaluated from phosphorus fractionation. Although the organic matter at both study sites had relatively high C:N and C:P ratios, the anoxic sediment decomposition was not affected by nutrient enrichments at the level applied in this study. The sediment metabolism (TCO2 and DOC production, and sulfate consumption) was 5-10 times higher in Wadden Sea sediment than in Bangrong mangrove sediment, probably due to the higher content of structural carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose) as indicated by higher C:N and C:P ratios in mangrove organic matter. This is substantiated by a lower nutrient release from Bangrong mangrove sediments and suggests a faster turnover of N and P by nutrient deficient bacteria in the mangrove sediment. DIP was released during anoxic decomposition in Wadden Sea sediment, but was retained in Bangrong mangrove sediment. Analysis of phosphor-us fractions in Bangrong mangrove sediment revealed that added excess DIP was efficiently taken up by the sediment particles and primarily retrieved in the easily exchangeable and iron bound fractions. The studied mangrove forest sediment seems to be a phosphorus sink.

Sediment geochemistry, rates of microbial metabolism, and the abundance of anaerobic respiratory bacteria were determined at sites differing in the abundance of fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) burrows and vegetation (Spartina ulterniflora) coverage. Solid-phase Fe(III) concentrations were 50 to 100 times higher, and solid sulfide concentrations were eight times lower in bioturbated, vegetated sediments (BVL) as compared to nonbioturbated, unvegetated (NUC) sediments. Integrated sulfate reduction rates were 10 times lower in BVL (2 mmol m(-2) d(-2)) as compared to NUC sediments (20 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Directly measured Fe(III) reduction rates were high at the BVL site, whereas no Fe(III) reduction was detected at NUC or in killed sediment treatments. Molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited 70% of carbon oxidation when added to NUC sediment but showed no effect on Fe(III) reduction or C oxidation in BVL sediments. Counts of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were two orders of magnitude higher in BVL sediments (10(7) cells g(-1)) in comparison to NUC sediments (10(5) cells g(-1)). Fe(III) respiration comprised up to 100% of carbon oxidation in BVL sediments, whereas sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process (greater than or equal to70% of C oxidation) at NUC. We provide strong evidence to show that macroorganisms stimulate FeRB to outcompete sulfate-reducing bacteria in saltmarsh sediments by supplying an abundance of reactive Fe(III) through reoxidation processes.",10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0230,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036158925&doi=10.4319%2flo.2002.47.1.0230&partnerID=40&md5=763c24408f58a19b0713698e0d9ccf22,Kostka_2002_90075253,"Kostka, J.E.; Gribsholt, B.; Petrie, E.; Dalton, D.; Skelton, H.; Kristensen, E."

Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. We tested how plant community composition and vegetation structure differences across estuaries influence model development, and whether data from multiple sensors, in particular Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar and Landsat, can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n=409, RMSE=464 g/m2, 12.2% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass and carbon for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model error was reduced by scaling field measured biomass by Landsat fraction green vegetation derived from object-based classification of National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery. We generated 30m resolution biomass maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map for each region. With a mean plant %C of 44.1% (n=1384, 95% C.I.=43.99% - 44.37%) we estimated mean aboveground carbon densities (Mg/ha) and total carbon stocks for each wetland type for each region.

Key to ecosystem functioning is wetland response to sea-level rise through accumulation of mineral and organic sediment. The organic sediment within coastal wetlands is composed of carbon sequestered over the time scale of the wetland?s existence. This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring. Marsh surface elevations were measured at each site (ranging from 0.771 meters to 1.462 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the marsh boundaries within current tidal conditions. Continuous Rate of Supply age models, based on lead-210 and cesium-137 isotope analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Over that time, accretion rates were very similar for each ecosystem: restored marsh sites (2.5 mm per year), followed by the salt marshes (2.7 mm per year) and mature mangroves (3.2 mm per year). The resulting carbon burial rates over the past century vary as a function of vegetation type, with mature mangroves burying on average 163 grams carbon per square meter per year, compared to young (restoring) mangroves with an average of 94 grams carbon per square meter per year and the salt marsh with an average of 64 grams carbon per square meter per year .

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90074944,2005,NA," Lamb, AL",author_02,"delta C-13 and C/N as potential coastal palaeoenvironmental indicators in the Mersey Estuary, UK","The reconstruction of former environments, and ultimately relative sea-level changes, in coastal and estuarine environments normally utilises a range of microfossil proxies, such as diatoms, foraminifera and pollen. As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the ""MIRACLE"" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some ""memory"" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg ""trapped"" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg. Conservation and monitoring of saltmarshes should be taken into consideration also from this environmental point of view.",10.1007/s11368-016-1618-8,NA,Covelli_2017_90075171,"Covelli, Stefano; Petranich, Elisa; Langone, Leonardo; Emili, Andrea; Acquavita, Alessandro"

Here we report the results of integrated analyses of the core, including its sedimentary lithology, grain size, foraminiferal abundance, chemical elements, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. The sedimentary environment has evolved from a fluvial-deposit, limnetic-deposit, littoral-deposit, shallow sea deposit, and finally to a delta-deposit environment since 40,000 cal yr BP. Environmentally induced differences in apparent mass accumulation rates (AMARs) of organic carbon (OC) have been significant; they have ranged between 3.73 and 30.77 g/(m(2)yr). The fact that the highest rates were associated with the delta-deposit environment indicates that the rate of carbon sequestration was greater in the sediments of estuarine wetlands than sediments of the continental shelf. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) proxy responded to several cold events, and there was a positive correlation between the CIA and OC-AMAR.

To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106326,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109371665&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2021.106326&partnerID=40&md5=3216bf8eb5f1c654c048f3e3ffbb3050,McClellan_2021_90075207,"McClellan, S.

However, the culturable microbial biomass and enzyme activity in the remediated soils were also lower than at site A.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, relationships between the current vegetation structure and environmental factors were evaluated in the tidal flat at the southern tip of Ganghwa, Korea, where salt marshes are well-developed. Results The vegetation structure in Ganghwa salt marshes was divided into three groups by cluster analysis: group A, dominated by Phragmites communis; group B, dominated by Suaeda japonica; and group C, dominated by other taxa. As determined by PERMANOVA, the groups showed significant differences with respect to altitude, soil moisture, soil organic matter, salinity, sand, clay, and silt ratios. A canonical correspondence analysis based on the percent cover of each species in the quadrats showed that the proportion of sand increased as the altitude increased and S. japonica appeared in soil with a relatively high silt proportion, while P. communis was distributed in soil with low salinity. Conclusions The distributions of three halophyte groups differed depending on the altitude, soil moisture, salinity, and soil organic matter, sand, silt, and clay contents. Pioneer species, such as S. japonica, appeared in soil with a relatively high silt content.

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh.

S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora. The decay rate of old C decreased and the mean residence time of C increased in SOM and its fractions following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence.

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.)

JOUR,90075133,2012, Europe," Leorri, E.",author_07,Organic matter sources for tidal marsh sediment over the past two millennia in the Minho River estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula),"Environmental changes during the last 2 millennia in the Minho River tidal marsh (NW Portugal-Spain border) were reconstructed. Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

JOUR,90075302,2017, Europe," Leorri, E.",author_03,Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries,"This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

Distribution of contaminants within sediment particle size fractions, was however, related to the proportion of organic carbon in the < 64 mu m fraction. The most significant factor influencing the degree of contamination with OCL and PCB is likely to be the source of sediments deposited on the salt marsh.

However, few programs have addressed the functional ecological equivalence of man-made marshes and their natural counterparts. This study addresses structural and functional interactions in a man-made and two natural marshes. This was done by integrating substrate characteristics and marsh utilization by organisms of two trophic levels. Sediment properties, infaunal community composition, and Fundulus heteroclitus marsh utilization were compared for a man-made Spartina salt marsh (between ages 1 to 3 yr) in Dills Creek, North Carolina, and adjacent natural marshes to the east and west. East natural marsh and planted marsh sediment grain-size distributions were more similar to each other than to the west natural marsh due to shared drainage systems, but sediment organic content of the planted marsh was much lower than in either natural marsh. This difference was reflected in macrofaunal composition. Natural marsh sediments were inhabited primarily by subsurface, deposit-feeding oligochaetes whereas planted marsh sediments were dominated by the tube-building, surface-deposit feeding polychaetes Streblospio benedicti and Manayunkia aestuarina. Infaunal differences were mirrored in Fundulus diets. Natural marsh diets contained more detritus and insects because oligochaetes, though abundant, were relatively inaccessible. Polychaetes and algae were major constituents of the planted marsh Fundulus diet. Though natural-marsh fish may acquire a potentially less nutritive, detritus-based diet relative to the higher animal protein diet of the planted marsh fish, Fundulus abundances were markedly lower in the planted marsh than in the natural marshes, indicating fewer fish were being supported. Lower Spartina stem densities in the planted marsh may have provided inadequate protection from predation or insufficient spawning sites for the fundulids. After three years, the planted marsh remained functionally distinct from the adjacent natural marshes. Mitigation success at Dills Creek could have been improved by increasing tidal flushing, thereby enhancing access to marine organisms and by mulching with Spartina wrack to increase sediment organic-matter content and porosity. Results from this study indicate that salt marshes should not be treated as a replaceable resource in the short term.

Traditional techniques for quantifying macrofaunal communities were combined with emerging stable isotopic approaches for evaluation of trophic recovery, making comparisons with a nearby natural Spartina foliosa habitat. Life history-based predictions successfully identified major colonization modes, although most taxa employed a variety of tactics for colonizing the restored marsh. The presence of S.foliosa did not seem to affect macrofaunal colonization or succession at the scale of this study. However, soil organic matter content in the restored marsh was positively correlated with insect densities, and high initial salinities may have limited the success of early colonists. Total macrofaunal densities recovered to natural marsh levels after 14 months and diversity, measured as species richness and the Shannon index (H'), was comparable to the natural marsh by 19 months. Some compositional disparities between the natural and created communities persisted after 19 months, including lower percentages of surface-feeding polychaetes (Polydora spp.) and higher percentages of dipteran insects and turbellarians in the Friendship marsh. As surficial structural similarity of infaunal communities between the Friendship and natural habitat was achieved, isotopic analyses revealed a simultaneous trajectory towards recovery of trophic structure. Enriched delta(13)C signatures of benthic microalgae and infauna, observed in the restored marsh shortly after establishment compared to natural Spartina habitat, recovered after 19 months. However, the depletion in delta(15)N signatures of macrofauna in the Friendship marsh indicated consumption of microalgae, particularly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, while macroalgae and Spartina made a larger contribution to macrofaunal diets in the natural habitat. Future successional studies must continue to develop and employ novel combinations of techniques for evaluating structural and functional recovery of disturbed and created habitats.

Sediment properties and macroinfaunal community structure were compared in patches invaded by Spartina hybrid and adjacent uninvaded patches at 3 sites in San Francisco Bay (2 tidal flats and 1 Salicornia marsh). We hypothesized that (1) sediments vegetated by Spartina hybrid would have reduced sediment grain size, higher organic matter content, lower redox potential, lower salinity and reduced microalgal biomass relative to adjacent unvegetated tidal flat sediments, and (2) that differences in the sediment environment would correspond to changes in the infaunal invertebrate community structure and feeding modes. We observed 75 % lower total macro-faunal density and lower species richness in Spartina-vegetated sediments at Elsie Roemer (30 yr old invasion) than in an adjacent unvegetated tidal flat. This was due to lower densities of surface-feeding amphipods, bivalves, cirratulid and spionid polychaetes. The proportional representation of subsurface-deposit feeders was greater in Spartina patches than in unvegetated sediments. At a more recently invaded site (Roberts Landing; 15 yr invasion), Spartina patches differed from tidal flat sediments in composition, but not in abundance. Native (Salicornia) and Spartina patches exhibited similar sediment properties at San Mateo, where the Spartina hybrid invaded 8 to 10 yr earlier. No differences were detected in densities or proportions of surface- or subsurface-deposit feeders, but the proportion of carnivores/omnivores and grazers increased in the hybrid-invaded patches. These studies suggest that the invasive Spartina hybrid in south San Francisco Bay can have differing effects on sediment ecosystems, possibly depending on the location, age, or type of habitats involved.",10.3354/meps292111,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20444456715&doi=10.3354%2fmeps292111&partnerID=40&md5=2e29a7f7f1e67aac04084a39dd723925,Neira_2005_90074977,"Neira, C.; Levin, L.A.; Grosholz, E.D."

This paper provides a description of the fauna and examines faunal succession in Salicornia-vegetated sediments of southern California. Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) and macrofaunal (animals greater than or equal to 0.3 mm) community structure were examined in sediments of five natural, southern California Salicornia spp. marshes (Tijuana Estuary, San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Anaheim Bay) and in created Salicornia marshes 16 months to 10 years in age, located within four of the bays. Oligochaetes and insects were the dominant taxa in both natural (71 to 98% of total fauna) and created (91 to 97%) marshes. In San Diego, Newport and Anaheim Bays, macrofaunal densities were generally higher in the created marshes (88 000 to 290 000 ind m(-2)) than in their natural counterparts (26 000 to 50 000 ind m(-2)). In the youngest system, Mission Bay, the reverse was true (natural: 113 000 vs created: 28 000 ind m-2). Similar species numbers were recorded from the created and adjacent natural marshes. Insects, especially chironomids, dolichopodids, and heleids, as well as the naidid oligochaete, Paranais litoralis, characterize early successional stages. Enchytraeid and tubificid oligochaetes reflect later succession evident in natural and older created marshes. Sediment organic matter (both combustible and below-ground plant biomass) was the environmental variable most commonly associated with densities of various macrofaunal taxa. These relationships were generally negative in the natural marshes and positive in the created marshes. Within-bay comparisons of macrofauna from natural Salicornia- vs Spartina-vegetated habitat in San Diego and Mission Bays revealed lower macrofaunal density (San Diego Bay only), proportionally fewer oligochaetes and more insects, and no differences in species richness in the Salicornia habitat. The oldest created Salicornia marsh (San Diego Bay) exhibited an assemblage intermediate in composition between those of the natural Salicornia- and Spartina-vegetated marshes. These results suggest: (a) faunal recovery following Salicornia marsh creation can require 10 or more years, (b) high macrofaunal variability among bays requires marsh creation reference site selection from within the same bay, and (c) Spartina-based research should not be used for Salicornia marsh management decisions.

Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

We conducted a field experiment in which we measured ecophysiological properties to explore the response of the ecosystem C stocks to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) in wetlands dominated by native Scirpus mariqueter (Scirpus) and Phragmites australis (Phragmites) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. We measured growing season length, leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), root biomass, net primary production (NPP), litter quality and litter decomposition, plant and soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks in ecosystems dominated by the three species. Our results showed that Spartina had a longer growing season, higher LAI, higher Pn, and greater root biomass than Scirpus and Phragmites. Net primary production (NPP) was 2.16 kg C m(-2) y(-1) in Spartina ecosystems, which was, on average, 1.44 and 0.47 kg C m(-2) y(-1) greater than that in Scirpus and Phragmites ecosystems, respectively. The litter decomposition rate, particularly the belowground decomposition rate, was lower for Spartina than Scirpus and Phragmites due to the lower litter quality of Spartina. The ecosystem C stock (20.94 kg m(-2)) for Spartina was greater than that for Scirpus (17.07 kg m(-2)), Phragmites (19.51 kg m(-2)) and the mudflats (15.12 kg m(-2)).

We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

JOUR,90075473,2020,NA," Li, Bo",author_02,"Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on saltmarsh nitrogen removal in the Yangtze River Estuary, China","Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

JOUR,90074430,2015,NA," Li, Gang",author_03,Reclamation of coastal salt marshes promoted carbon loss from previously-sequestered soil carbon pool,"Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of 'blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future.

Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles.

The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern.

JOUR,90075383,2019,NA," Li, Jiabing",author_03,"Changes in sediment nutrients following Spartina alterniflora invasion in a subtropical estuarine wetland, China","Invasion of the exotic cordgrass, Spartina alternifiora, has become a global crisis and its spread is leading to significant alterations in the functions of ecosystems. However, alteration in nutrient levels caused by invasion of non-native plant species is poorly understood, and the effects of invasive plants on sediment nutrients found in previous studies are contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that an exotic plant species invasion will change the chemical characteristics of an ecosystem over time. To test this hypothesis, the spatial distribution of S. alternifiora in 2006, 2010 and 2014 was analyzed by aerial images, Google Earth satellite images and field investigations. Furthermore, according to the space time reciprocal principle, a primary field survey with three locations (S1, S2 and S4) was conducted in 2014, and sediment nutrient levels, including total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alternifiora. We also investigated six locations (S1 S6) in 2016 in the same manner to compare the changes in sediment nutrients between the two years. The area infested with S. alternifiora increased from 10.8 ha in 2006, to 26.2 ha in 2010, and 37.5 ha in 2014, with a 35.6% annual expansion rate between 2006 and 2010, and a 10.8% annual expansion rate between 2010 and 2014, respectively. Considering the two field survey results, we found that S. alternifiora invasion increased sediment nutrient levels in the early-term (i.e., S1-S4 period, approximately 10 years), and then significantly decreased TC, TN and TP content to levels even lower than bare beach. Analyses of stoichiometry characteristics of the sediment nutrients also verified these two apparent stages. The results showed that early-term invasion of S. alternifiora and subsequent invasion alter sediment nutrients differently, and these results may explain the seemingly contradictory increases and decreases in nutrient levels reported in previous studies.

Influence of Spartina colonization on the supply and accumulation of organic carbon in tidal salt marshes of northern Jiangsu Province, China. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 486-498. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Two species of cordgrass (Spartina anglica Hubbard and Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) were artificially introduced to the intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province, China, in 1963 and 1982, respectively. However, as alien species, the impact of Spartina on the tidal flat ecosystem remains largely unknown. Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, two native plants in the intertidal zone of northern Jiangsu Province, China, are C3-type plants, whereas the Spartina species are C4-type plants. In this article, we investigate the vertical distribution of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic carbon isotope ratios in different ecosystems associated with the northern Jiangsu tidal flats; analyze changes in the organic carbon sources in the tidal flat sediments after Spartina colonization; compare carbon burial patterns at different evolutionary stages in the tidal flats; and discuss the effects of Spartina on organic carbon cycling over the intertidal flats on the Jiangsu, China, coast. Before the introduction of Spartina, the organic material in the intertidal sediments of the study area mainly came from a combination of marine and C3 plants. After the introduction of Spartina, the contribution of S. alternillora to the organic carbon content in the salt-marsh strata exceeded those made by marine sources and other C3 plants. On the S. anglica flat, the quantity of organic carbon originated from S. anglica was lower than from S. alternillora but was still greater than the contribution made by native C3 plants. The introduction of Spartina not only had a significant effect on primary productivity throughout the tidal flats but also enhanced the organic carbon accumulation rate in the sediment.",10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863277942&doi=10.2112%2fJCOASTRES-D-11-00062.1&partnerID=40&md5=630e318295408c8c2d7255bb939f6275,Gao_2012_90074535,"Gao, Jianhua; Bai, Fenglong; Yang, Yang; Gao, Shu; Liu, Zhiyong; Li, Jun"
JOUR,90075430,2016,NA," Li, Jun",author_06,"The effect of biomass variations of Spartina alterniflora on the organic carbon content and composition of a salt marsh in northern Jiangsu Province, China","The relationship of the organic carbon content and surface sediment composition to the litter mass of Spartina alterniflora was analyzed to investigate the responses of organic carbon content and composition to biomass changes in a salt marsh after the introduction of S. alterniflora. The vertical distribution of sediment organic carbon and its relationship with S. alterniflora underground biomass was also examined. The results show that the total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant carbon (RC) and labile carbon (LC) contents were significantly greater in the surface sediments of the S. alterniflora flat, which showed different intra-annual variation trends compared to a bare flat. In particular, the majority of S. alterniflora-derived organic carbon was LC in the S. alterniflora flat sediments, indicating that the introduction of S. alterniflora resulted in a significant increase in surface sediment LC content. In addition, the results of S. alterniflora litter decomposition revealed a rapid decrease of 40% in the organic carbon stocks within the first 2 months, and the TOC and LC contents showed intra-annual variation trends similar to the surface litter mass but with a two-month ""phase difference"" in time. Further analysis indicated, S. alterniflora litter controlled the content and proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived TOC input, and it ultimately affected the TOC content variations in the sediments. However, due to the LC mainly originated from S. alterniflora, the surface litter exerted more significant impact on the variation of LC content. In the bare flat core, the relatively low TOC, RC and LC content values were significantly influenced by the grain control effect, and the origins of these components were mainly derived from non-S. alterniflora sources. However, in the S. alterniflora flat cores, the relationships between organic carbon content, grain size and underground biomass, together with the analysis of the organic carbon origins, indicated that the S. alterniflora underground biomass significantly affected the origin of organic carbon. In addition, Spartina alterniflora introduction significantly increased the carbon sequestration capacity of the tidal salt marsh in North Jiangsu. Furthermore, the TOC, LC and RC accumulation rate analyses also indicated that S. alterniflora introduction improved the salt marsh soil and was beneficial to long-term carbon sequestration of the organic carbon pool.

JOUR,90075456,2020,NA," Li, Jun",author_05,Conversion of coastal marshes to croplands decreases organic carbon but increases inorganic carbon in saline soils,"Over the past century, conversion to agriculture has greatly reduced the global extent of coastal wetlands leading to degradation and loss of these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.",10.1002/ldr.3538,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078656687&doi=10.1002%2fldr.3538&partnerID=40&md5=23e583e88350f309dc61605d090b24bc,Zhu_2020_90075456,"Zhu, Yuanshan; Wang, Yidong; Guo, Changcheng; Xue, Dongmei; Li, Jun; Chen, Qing; Song, Zhaoliang; Lou, Yilai; Kuzyakov, Yakov; Wang, Zhong-Liang; Jones, Davey L."

In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.",10.5194/bg-13-6565-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006367236&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6565-2016&partnerID=40&md5=d57a008abcef0f9470eec299deab60ff,Liu_2016_90074967,"Liu, Yalong; Wang, Ping; Ding, Yuanjun; Lu, Haifei; Li, Lianqing; Cheng, Kun; Zheng, Jufeng; Filley, Timothy; Zhang, Xuhui; Zheng, Jinwei; Pan, Genxing"

Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation.

We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh.

However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh.

Generally, average contents of SOC and TN were higher at tidal flooding Guangrao wetland (GRA) than those at Changyi (CY) wetland where the tidal can rarely reached. Among the five profiles, higher variations of SOC and TN were observed in CYB1 and CYB2, where the TP contents showed lower variations. SOC showed a rapid decrease with depth in CYB1 and CYB2, whereas they tended to increase with depth in GRA1 and GRA2. Vertical distributions of TN were significantly correlated with SOC in profile GRA1, CYB1, and CYB2. However, no clear trend was found on the vertical variations of TP. Additionally, C, N, and P ecological stoichiometry in these two coastal wetlands had high complexities within wetland. The C/N ratios were generally higher, while the C/P ratios and the N/P ratios were comparatively low, indicating the coastal wetland biogeochemical processes were more limited by N and P, with the former may being the primary factor.

However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool.

Results of geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index (RI), pollution load index (PLI), toxic risk index (TRI) and contamination severity index (CSI) demonstrated that pollution levels of Cd and Hg were moderate, which should attract more attention as main pollution factors.

However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear.

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.",10.6084/m9.figshare.11368025.v1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081009463&doi=10.1029%2f2019JG005217&partnerID=40&md5=b6a9e154be823aa420baa074068f6839,Xue_2020_90075265,"Xue, Lian; Jiang, Junyan; Li, Xiuzhen; Yan, Zhongzheng; Zhang, Qian; Ge, Zhenming; Tian, Bo; Craft, Christopher"

Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17 g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8 years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths.

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox).

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.",10.1016/j.csr.2018.01.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044392821&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d734e5a4562b0512ae5146a564922539,Loh_2018_90075224,"Loh, Pei Sun; Cheng, Long-Xiu; Yuan, Hong-Wei; Yang, Lin; Lou, Zhang-Hua; Jin, Ai-Min; Chen, Xue-Gang; Lin, Yu-Shih; Chen, Chen-Tung Arthur"

Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

JOUR,90075049,2018,NA," Liu, Bo",author_05,Solute Reservoirs Reflect Variability of Early Diagenetic Processes in Temperate Brackish Surface Sediments,"Coastal marine sediments are a hotspot of organic matter degradation. Mineralization products of early diagenetic processes accumulate in the pore waters of the sediment, are subject of biological uptake and secondary biogeochemical processes and are released back into the water column via advective and diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Seven representative sites in the shallow coastal area of the southern Baltic Sea (15-45 m water depth), ranging from permeable sands to fine grained muds, were investigated on a seasonal basis for their key mineralization processes as well as their solid phase and pore water composition to identify the drivers for the variability of early diagenetic processes in the different sediment types. The sandy sediments showed about one order of magnitude lower organic carbon contents compared to the muds, while oxygen uptake rates were similar in both sediment types. Significantly higher oxygen uptake rates were determined in two near-shore muddy sites than in a deeper coastal muddy basin, which is due to higher nutrient loads and the corresponding addition of fresh algal organic matter in the near-shore sites. Pore water concentration profiles in the studied sediments were usually characterized by a typical biogeochemical zonation with oxic, suboxic, and sulfidic zones. An up to 15 cm thick suboxic zone was sustained by downward transport of oxidized material in which dissolved iron and phosphate indicate an intensive reduction of reactive Fe with the release of adsorbed phosphorus. While the geochemical zonation was stable over time in the muds of the studied deeper basin, high variability was observed in the muds of a near-coastal bay probably mainly controlled by sediment mixing activities. The sediments can be characterized by essentially two factors based on their near-surface benthic solute reservoirs: (1) their organic matter mineralization and solute accumulation efficiency and (2) their redox-state. Benthic solute reservoirs in the pore waters of the top decimeter were generally higher in the muddy than in the sandy sediments as the more permeable sands were prone to an intensive exchange between pore water and bottom water. The three studied muddy sites showed great dissimilarities with respect to their predominating redox-sensitive metabolites (dissolved iron, manganese, and sulfide). Surface-near advective transport like irrigation of permeable sands and rearrangement of cohesive muds had a particularly strong influence on early diagenetic processes in the studied sediments and were probably the most important cause for the spatiotemporal variability of their benthic solute reservoirs.",10.3389/fmars.2018.00413,NA,Lipka_2018_90075049,"Lipka, Marko; Woelfel, Jana; Gogina, Mayya; Kallmeyer, Jens; Liu, Bo; Morys, Claudia; Forster, Stefan; Boettcher, Michael E."

JOUR,90074332,2020,NA," Liu, Min",author_04,Climatic temperature controls the geographical patterns of coastal marshes greenhouse gases emissions over China,"Coastal marshes contribute greatly to atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) and have thus attracted considerable attention at regional and global scales. However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125378,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089093548&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.125378&partnerID=40&md5=e352c5c75411052cf4b385c4843ec9aa,Li_2020_90074332,"Li, Xiaofei; Sardans, Jordi; Hou, Lijun; Liu, Min; Xu, Chaobin; Penuelas, Josep"

However, the factors that affect the heterogeneous variability in n-DAMO microbial abundance and activity across estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

However, the roles of the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence in regulating soil dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction processes (denitrification (DNF), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANA) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) remains unclear. The objective of this study was therefore to reveal the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance.We investigated plant biomass, soil properties, NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance of NO3 (-) reduction pathways following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequences of 6, 10, and 14 years compared to Cyperus malaccensis in a coastal wetland of southeastern China.The S. alterniflora invasion generally increased plant biomass, soil water content, available substrates, nirS, anammox bacterial 16S rRNA and nrfA gene abundance, but it decreased soil bulk density. Soil DNF, ANA and DNRA rates in stands of S. alterniflora ranged from 1.52 to 17.58, 0.31 to 1.27 and 0.14 to 2.01 nmol N g(-1) h(-1), respectively, which were generally higher than the values in stands of C. malaccensis. The soil NO3 (-) reduction rates generally increased with the increasing chronosequence of invasion by S. alterniflora, while the changes in DNF and ANA rates were less pronounced than changes in DNRA. DNF was the dominant pathway (70.00-92.41%), and the ANA and DNRA contributed 2.49-15.27% and 5.10-20.75% to the total NO3 (-) reduction, respectively. The contributions of DNF and ANA to the total NO3 (-) reduction decreased slightly, while the contribution of DNRA increased remarkably after S. alterniflora invasion. Soil NO3 (-) reduction processes were influenced by available substrates and associated microbial activities. It is estimated that an N loss of approximately 520.97 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in C. malaccensis and 794.46 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in S. alterniflora were linked to both DNF and ANA processes.The S. alterniflora invasion altered soil NO3 (-) reduction processes by increasing soil microbial activities and available substrates and thus may further mediate the soil N availability in the coastal wetlands.",10.1007/s11104-017-3464-x,NA,Gao_2017_90075235,"Gao, Dengzhou; Li, Xiaofei; Lin, Xianbiao; Wu, Dianming; Jin, Baoshi; Huang, Yanping; Liu, Min; Chen, Xing"
JOUR,90075299,2016,NA," Liu, Min",author_03,The impact of drying on structure of sedimentary organic matter in wetlands: Probing with native and amended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,"Wetland sediments undergo dry-wet cycles that may change their structural properties and affect geochemical behavior of associated organic compounds. In this study, we examined the effect of drying on particle size distributions and the rapid (24 h) sorption reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with salt marsh sediments in Nueces Delta, South Texas. Drying reduced the fraction of fine particles in organically richer sediments, indicating structural rearrangement of organic matter and mineral aggregates. Among the 16 EPA priority PAHs examined, dried sediment preferentially released 1.0-7.5% of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene to added seawater (solid: water mass ratio of 1/100)- significantly greater than release from sediments maintained in the wet state. On the other hand, drying also increased the affinity of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) for experimentally amended (deuterated) phenanthrene relative to continually wet sediments. Further, deuterated phenanthrene was even more effectively retained when it was added to wet sediment that was subsequently dried and rewetted.These apparently contradictory results can be reconciled and explained by SOM having a heterogeneous distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones - e.g., a zonal model. We propose that drying changed the orientation of amphiphilic SOM, exposing hydrophobic zones and promoting the release of some of theft native PAHs to water. Freshly amended PAHs were only able to penetrate into the surface hydrophobic zone and/or deeper but rapidly accessible (""kinetics"") zone in wet sediments clue to the brief adsorption contact time. Subsequent drying presumably then induced structural changes in SOM that isolated these amended PAHs in sites inaccessible to water exchange in the next rewetting. These results provide insights into structural changes of SOM upon drying, and help predict the fate of compounds such as organic contaminants during drought/flood oscillations.

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption. The findings of this study indicate that freshwater restoration can contribute to controlling the eutrophication status of water bodies through increasing P sorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal wetlands with different plant cover types (including bare land, Phragmites australis, and Suaeda salsa wetlands) and groundwater table wetlands (including low groundwater table, medium groundwater table, and high groundwater table wetlands) were investigated in 2012-2013 to characterize the spatial and temporal changes and the effects of groundwater tables on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The results showed that SOCs in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 regardless of the groundwater tables, while TNs was higher in 2013 than in 2012 except in the BL soil with low groundwater tables and the PA wetlands with middle groundwater tables. The SOCc and TNc were mainly concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. SOC. and TNc were fitted very well with soil depth by the general linear fit (p < 0.01). The Lorentz models were ideal for the relationships among SOC, TN and electrical conductivity (EC), indicating that certain EC values could improve carbon and nitrogen accumulation. The theoretical threshold of EC for the maximum SOC and SOCs was 2.2 ms/cm, and the maximum TN and TNs highly depended on groundwater tables (0.9-1.0 ms/cm for LW, 1.6-1.8 ms/cm for MW and 3.0 ms/cm for HW). The general linear model results showed that SOC was positively correlated with TN at the same groundwater table (p < 0.01). Additionally, a positive linear relationship was also observed among SOC, TN and silt + clay contents for all groundwater tables (p < 0.05).

The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs.

Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for 'blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.",10.1007/s10021-019-00373-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072024527&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-019-00373-x&partnerID=40&md5=cdd95a8b2162a83abc202b894166f51b,Santini_2019_90074343,"Santini, Nadia S.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Hua, Quan; Zawadzki, Atun; Mazumder, Debashish; Mercer, Tim R.; Munoz-Rojas, Miriam; Hardwick, Simon A.; Madala, Bindu Swapna; Cornwell, William; Thomas, Torsten; Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Adam, Paul; Paul, Swapan; Verges, Adriana"

Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground root production is proposed to increase soil elevation enabling these intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level. However, shallow soil subsidence is frequently observed, which may cancel out or even outweigh the positive effects of surface accretion and root production on soil elevation gains. The processes that lead to shallow soil subsidence have not often been investigated. Here, we used computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the volume of coarse pores in the top 20 cm of 30-cm-deep soil cores collected from mangroves and salt marshes within Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. The four field sites have long-term observations of variation in soil surface elevation gain, surface accretion rate, and shallow subsidence rate using the rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method. Over our sites, we found that the rates of shallow soil subsidence were positively related to the volume of soil coarse pores and soil clay and silt content rather than to the volume of fine pores or total porosity or other soil properties. In turn, the volume of soil coarse pores was positively related to the volume of animal burrows and root mass. Fine-pore volume and total porosity of soils were negatively associated with soil bulk density, which was in turn negatively related to soil organic matter content. Our results indicate influences of differently sized soil pores in shallow soil subsidence and suggest that animal burrowing may play a role in shallow soil subsidence.",10.1007/s12237-019-00659-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074766995&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-019-00659-2&partnerID=40&md5=83113c4e33a6f993e2bcd4a3daead83f,Xiong_2019_90075149,"Xiong, Yanmei; Ola, Anne; Phan, Sang Minh; Wu, Jingtao; Lovelock, Catherine E."

Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.",10.3389/fmars.2019.00014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061346855&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2019.00014&partnerID=40&md5=ebb9945e4495907ebeed5203275d99c2,Brodersen_2019_90075285,"Brodersen, Kasper Elgetti; Treyathan-Tackett, Stacey M.; Nielsen, Daniel A.; Connolly, Rod M.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Atwood, Trisha B.; Macreadie, Peter, I"

Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of similar to 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger OC stocks (175-504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44-271 Mg/ha). Variation in OC stocks among nonriverine sites was high in comparison with riverine and mixed geomorphic settings, with sites closer to riverine outflow from the east and south of Moreton Bay having higher stocks than those located on the sand islands in the northwest of the bay. Sediment OC stocks increased with elevation within nonriverine settings, but not in riverine geomorphic settings. Sediment OC stocks did not differ between mangrove and saltmarsh habitats. OC stocks did, however, differ between dominant species across the research area and within geomorphic settings. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of the South East Queensland catchments (17,792 ha) are comprised of approximately 4,100,000-5,200,000 Mg of sediment OC.

Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. We tested how plant community composition and vegetation structure differences across estuaries influence model development, and whether data from multiple sensors, in particular Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar and Landsat, can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n=409, RMSE=464 g/m2, 12.2% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass and carbon for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model error was reduced by scaling field measured biomass by Landsat fraction green vegetation derived from object-based classification of National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery. We generated 30m resolution biomass maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map for each region. With a mean plant %C of 44.1% (n=1384, 95% C.I.=43.99% - 44.37%) we estimated mean aboveground carbon densities (Mg/ha) and total carbon stocks for each wetland type for each region.

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.",10.1038/s41586-019-0951-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062585818&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-019-0951-7&partnerID=40&md5=4b44efb7fab903f4cd8991016a2c167d,Rogers_2019_90075480,"Rogers, Kerrylee; Kelleway, Jeffrey J.; Saintilan, Neil; Megonigal, J.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

However, little information is available regarding their impacts on soil nutrient pools in these ecosystems. We studied C-org, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in above-ground ant mounds and in soils under mounds for three ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida), and estimated their contribution to the total soil nutrient pools in a marsh wetland. Ant impacts were greatest in above-ground soils. All measured nutrient concentrations in above-ground mounds were significantly higher than the average values in reference soils (upper 25 cm). However, except for DOC, no significant differences for nutrient concentrations existed between soils under mounds and reference soils. The impacts of ant mounds on soil C and nutrient concentrations varied by ant species. L. niger above-ground mounds stored less C-org, TN and NO3- than F. candida and L. flavus mounds, or reference soils. At the ecosystem scale, soils in above-ground mounds and under ant mounds all contained less C-org per hectare than the reference soils. Total amounts in nutrient pools from mounds of the three ant species comprised from 5.3% to 7.6% of the total in natural marsh soils. More importantly, ant mounds increased the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient pools. Thus, ant mounds can be important to a fully integrated understanding of the structure and function of wetland nutrient cycles and balances. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

We conducted a field experiment in which we measured ecophysiological properties to explore the response of the ecosystem C stocks to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) in wetlands dominated by native Scirpus mariqueter (Scirpus) and Phragmites australis (Phragmites) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. We measured growing season length, leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), root biomass, net primary production (NPP), litter quality and litter decomposition, plant and soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks in ecosystems dominated by the three species. Our results showed that Spartina had a longer growing season, higher LAI, higher Pn, and greater root biomass than Scirpus and Phragmites. Net primary production (NPP) was 2.16 kg C m(-2) y(-1) in Spartina ecosystems, which was, on average, 1.44 and 0.47 kg C m(-2) y(-1) greater than that in Scirpus and Phragmites ecosystems, respectively. The litter decomposition rate, particularly the belowground decomposition rate, was lower for Spartina than Scirpus and Phragmites due to the lower litter quality of Spartina. The ecosystem C stock (20.94 kg m(-2)) for Spartina was greater than that for Scirpus (17.07 kg m(-2)), Phragmites (19.51 kg m(-2)) and the mudflats (15.12 kg m(-2)).

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides.

In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process.

Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community.

Despite this issue, virtually nothing is known on local plant species exposure to metal contaminants, nor their ability to uptake and translocate metal(loid)s from contaminated estuarine sediment. In the current study, we assessed the accumulation and partitioning of the metal(loid)s Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Se in the dominant saltmarsh primary producer, Sporobolus virginicus, across three urbanised estuaries in NSW Australia. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, while Sydney Olympic Park, Port Jackson exhibited intermediate metal(loid) loadings and Hunter Wetlands exhibited the lowest loadings among estuaries. Essential metals (Zn and Cu) were more mobile, with sediment:root bioconcentration factors (BCFs) greater than unity and translocation among plant organs greater than, or equal to, unity. Other metal(loid)s were less mobile, with BCFs equal to unity and translocation factors among organs much reduced. Despite these barriers to translocation, all metal(loid)s were accumulated to roots with dose, and further accumulative relationships between metal(loid)s in roots and culms, and culms and leaves, were evidenced (with the exception of Cu). Along with sediment metal(loid)s, increases in sediment pH predicted Cu uptake in roots and increases in soil organic matter predicted Se uptake in roots. Although significant positive linear relationships were observed between sediment metal (loid)s and plant organ metal(loid)s(withholding Cu), the variance explained was low to intermediate for most metal(loid)s suggesting employing S. virginicus as an accumulative bioindicator would be impractical.

All metals accumulated in roots with increasing sediment exposure, and lower soil organic matter predicted greater Pb and Cu uptake to roots. Further, increases in sediment pH predicted greater Cd root accumulation. However, transport was regulated to the non-photosynthetic stem for Zn, and to the PS stem for Zn and Pb.

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes.

Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.",10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a,Ferreira_2013_90074595,"Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands is known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four cores - two collected from marine influenced saltmarshes (WAP-M and POR-M) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (WAP-F and POR-F) - highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. 13C NMR analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C, however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and 210Pb dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered (""control"") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha-1year-1). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.",10.3389/fmars.2019.00014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061346855&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2019.00014&partnerID=40&md5=ebb9945e4495907ebeed5203275d99c2,Brodersen_2019_90075285,"Brodersen, Kasper Elgetti; Treyathan-Tackett, Stacey M.; Nielsen, Daniel A.; Connolly, Rod M.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Atwood, Trisha B.; Macreadie, Peter, I"

However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.",10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5,Ribeiro_2015_90074622,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Almeida, C.

In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

Here, we estimate soil, pore water, and surface-water carbon fluxes in an Australian estuarine tidal creek to assess whether (1) advective pore water exchange releases some of the soil carbon, (2) outwelling (lateral exports) represents a major carbon sequestration mechanism, and (3) methane emissions offset soil carbon sequestration. A radon (Rn-222) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 +/- 3.6 to 15.6 +/- 8.1 cm d(-1). Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. Organic carbon burial in soils derived from Pu239 + 240 dating was 11-63 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Methane and carbon dioxide emissions at the water-air interface were 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 63 +/- 166 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. When calculated as CO2-equivalents, aquatic CH4 emissions converted to 19-94 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset < 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) catchment d(-1)) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial. Because much of this DIC remains in the ocean after air-water equilibration, lateral DIC exports may represent an important long-term carbon sink. Recent research has focused on quantifying carbon burial rates in blue carbon habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves.

Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103 +/- 61 Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30 +/- 30 Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32 +/- 1 Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197 Mg/ha (RMSE = 24 Mg/ha).

Dark N-2-N fluxes were strongly controlled by sediment oxygen demand (SOD) across the 3 estuaries, 4 seasons, and 12 benthic habitats (r(2)=0.743; p<0.001; n=142; slope=0.0170). However, some of the slopes differed significantly between seasons and among estuaries and habitats, and all of the slopes were correlated with the C-13 values and C:N ratios of sediment organic matter. Ternary mixing diagrams with the contribution of algal, seagrass, and terrestrial/mangrove material to sediment organic matter showed that habitats, seasons, and estuaries dominated by a mixture of seagrass and algal material had the lowest slopes, and slopes increase as habitats, seasons, and estuaries have an increasing contribution from terrestrial/ mangrove material. Overall, the slopes of dark N-2 fluxes versus SOD were low compared to previous studies, most likely due to either, or a combination of, the C:N ratio of the organic matter, the mixture of C:N ratios making up the organic matter, the structure of the organic matter, and/or the SOD rates. This study demonstrated that it is not only the quantity but also the type (quality), and maybe the mixture, of organic matter that is an important control on denitrification. As such, rapid global changes to detrital sources to coastal systems due to losses of mangrove, seagrasses, and saltmarshes, and associated increases in algae and macrophytes, are also expected to impact system level losses of nitrogen via denitrification.",10.1002/2013GB004631,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887264017&doi=10.1002%2f2013GB004631&partnerID=40&md5=5ddf12df2d8a863a8ec24bea9855b087,Eyre_2013_90075129,"Eyre, Bradley D.; Maher, Damien T.; Squire, Peter"

Key to ecosystem functioning is wetland response to sea-level rise through accumulation of mineral and organic sediment. The organic sediment within coastal wetlands is composed of carbon sequestered over the time scale of the wetland?s existence. This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring. Marsh surface elevations were measured at each site (ranging from 0.771 meters to 1.462 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the marsh boundaries within current tidal conditions. Continuous Rate of Supply age models, based on lead-210 and cesium-137 isotope analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Over that time, accretion rates were very similar for each ecosystem: restored marsh sites (2.5 mm per year), followed by the salt marshes (2.7 mm per year) and mature mangroves (3.2 mm per year). The resulting carbon burial rates over the past century vary as a function of vegetation type, with mature mangroves burying on average 163 grams carbon per square meter per year, compared to young (restoring) mangroves with an average of 94 grams carbon per square meter per year and the salt marsh with an average of 64 grams carbon per square meter per year .

Particularly, fluctuations in abundance of dominant species might indicate major changes in resource use and ecosystem functioning. Here we use quantitative surveys of Baltic brackish and salt marsh plant communities to infer how variability in species abundances and environmental conditions influence plant assimilation rates and whether compensatory effects in abundance mask variability in functionality. The variability in species richness and assimilation rates was negatively correlated with average soil organic matter content and moisture and positively correlated with soil pH. It was independent of the variability in soil conditions. The abundances of rare species and species of intermediate abundances increased with increasing community wide assimilation rates. Our findings indicate that the strength of compensatory mechanisms that stabilise assimilation rates in salt marsh environments heavily depend on soil conditions.

Environmental gradients have shown effects on key plant functional traits that subsequently explain ecosystem properties of several systems. However, little is known concerning how associations between plant functional traits, including both below- and aboveground plant components, predict ecosystem properties and independently measured final ecosystem services. Here, we modeled (1) the responses of the leaf and plant economics spectrum, Plant size axis, and root growth to environmental gradients and (2) how associations between plant functional traits explain trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem properties and final services. Forty-four plots were studied in a coastal marsh landscape of the German North Sea Coast. We used a partial least square structural equation model approach to test the hypothesized model. We found (1) a negative covariation between plant traits pertaining to a size axis and traits explaining both plant growth (roots and stems) and the leaf economics spectrum; (2) this trade-off responded significantly to the land use gradient and nutrient availability, which were both strongly driven by the groundwater gradient; (3) this trade-off explained an initial major trade-off between carbon stocks, at one extreme of the axis, and both the habitat value to conserve endangered plants and forage production for meat and dairy products at the other extreme.

Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized.

JOUR,90074490,2016, Europe (rare)," Marani, M.",author_04,"Spatial variation of salt-marsh organic and inorganic deposition and organic carbon accumulation: Inferences from the Venice lagoon, Italy","Salt marshes are ubiquitous features of the tidal landscape governed by mutual feedbacks among processes of physical and biological nature. Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora from the BBE is efficient in accumulating some metals, despite usually low metal concentrations in sediments and plants. This accumulation capacity has implications for the whole system through the fate of the tissues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

Here, we quantify how marsh erosion differs between saline and brackish marshes of the Mississippi Delta. We analyzed long-term (1932-2015) maps of marsh loss and developed an algorithm to distinguish edge erosion from interior loss. We found that the edge erosion rate remains nearly constant at decadal timescales, whereas interior loss varies by more than 100%. On average, roughly half of marsh loss can be attributed to edge erosion, the other half to interior loss. Based on data from 42 cores, brackish marsh soils had a lower bulk density (0.17 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3)), a higher organic content (43% vs. 26%), a lower shear strength (2.0 vs. 2.5 kPa), and a lower shear strength in the root layer (13.8 vs. 20.7 kPa) than saline marsh soils. We then modified an existing marsh edge erosion model by including a salinity-dependent erodibility. By calibrating the erodibility with the observed retreat rates, we found that the brackish marsh is two to three times more erodible than the saline marshes. Overall, this model advances the ability to simulate estuarine systems as a whole, thus transcending the salinity boundaries often used in compartmentalized marsh models.",10.1002/esp.5108,NA,Valentine_2021_90075038,"Valentine, Kendall; Bruno, Grayton; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"

Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.",10.1007/s13157-021-01528-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122921800&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-021-01528-0&partnerID=40&md5=5177269d35eb348e8e758c2290d7f0bb,Valentine_2022_90075040,"Valentine, Kendall; Hotard, Abbey; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"

These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.",10.1002/2017JG003780,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020705442&doi=10.1002%2f2017JG003780&partnerID=40&md5=cc8df285de677dc95dfa9e92f1285784,Spivak_2017_90075116,"Spivak, Amanda C.; Gosselin, Kelsey; Howard, Evan; Mariotti, Giulio; Forbrich, Inke; Stanley, Rachel; Sylva, Sean P."

To determine if episodic marsh impoundments could be partially responsible for the observed cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) dieback at Crissy Field, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, we examined sulfur chemistry and plant stress along transects between and during tidal inlet closure events from 2007 to 2008. During closures, porewater sulfide (PW S2-) concentrations did not respond consistently among sites, nor did they increase to levels likely to cause stress damage to cordgrass (>1 mM). However, sediment solid-phase total reduced sulfur (TRS) concentrations did respond strongly to closures both at surface and subsurface depth intervals, and they were greatest in sites with high organic matter content (>5%). The temporal patterns of both PW S2- and TRS suggest that while sulfate reduction may be enhanced during closure events, the free sulfide produced is largely precipitated into solid-phase minerals. Even without millimolar levels of PW S2-, plant stress was observed during closures, as indicated by a buildup of ethanol in root tissues, a by-product of fermentative respiration brought on by limited oxygen availability. Further, enhanced sulfate reduction may be related to the higher relative concentrations of methylmercury in low intertidal surface sediments observed during closure events. These data suggest that, in support of vegetated tidal marsh restoration goals, tidal flows should be maintained actively to reduce the impact of impoundment events on marsh biogeochemistry and productivity.",10.1111/j.1526-100X.2011.00849.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872686857&doi=10.1111%2fj.1526-100X.2011.00849.x&partnerID=40&md5=45bafaca23f780692da171498bdda573,Windham-Myers_2013_90074837,"Windham-Myers, Lisamarie; Ward, Kristen; Marvin-DiPasquale, Mark; Agee, Jennifer L.; Kieu, Le H.; Kakouros, Evangelos"

Several sources of variation can lead to spatial differences in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species including: biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg production and availability within an organism's home range; trophic positions of consumers and MeHg biomagnification efficiency in food webs; and individual prey preferences that influence diet composition. To better understand spatial variation in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species, we evaluated the effects of habitat biogeochemistry, food web structure, and diet composition in the wetland-obligate California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) at three wetlands along the Petaluma River in northern San Francisco Bay, California, USA. The concentration of MeHg in sediments differed significantly among wetlands. We identified three sediment and porewater measurements that contributed significantly to a discriminant function explaining differences in habitat biogeochemistry among wetlands: the porewater concentration of ferrous iron, the percent organic matter, and the sediment MeHg concentration. Food web structure and biomagnification efficiency were similar among wetlands, with trophic magnification factors for MeHg ranging from 1.84 to 2.59. In addition, regurgitation samples indicated that black rails were dietary generalists with similar diets among wetlands (percent similarity indices > 70%). Given the similarities in diet composition, food web structure, and MeHg biomagnification efficiency among wetlands, we concluded that variation in habitat biogeochemistry and associated sediment MeHg production was the primary driver of differences in MeHg concentrations among black rails from different wetlands.

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models.

With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and 210Pb dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered (""control"") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha-1year-1). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ""blue carbon ecosystems"" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.",10.1002/lno.12011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122708409&doi=10.1002%2flno.12011&partnerID=40&md5=d81ebb481a511605d40a7fd7aa1ec32d,Graversen_2022_90075208,"Graversen, Anna Elizabeth Lovgren; Banta, Gary T.; Masque, Pere; Krause-Jensen, Dorte"

Sediments were collected from McGuill Lake, a small freshwater lake, and two salt marsh sites in Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, and size-fractioned by wet sieving. Physical forcing or energy, indicated by tides, tidal current, and wind and wind fetch area, is weakest in the lake, intermediate strength at the Nueces Delta, and strongest at Copano Bay. Results from total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) and n-alkane analysis, and C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) showed that the SOM from all three sites became more degraded towards finer size fractions, from > 300 mu m, 300-125 mu m, 125-63 mu m, 63-32 mu m to < 32 mu m. Relative to the coarse fractions, the fine fractions were enriched in the degradation indicator gamma-aminobutyric acid, and in aliphatic and proteinaceous components, as shown from NMR spectra and lower C/N ratio values. This degradation pattern of SOM with size is typical for sediments from coastal and lacustrine environments. However, the contents of organic carbon (OC), THAAs and n-alkanes were higher in sandy fractions than in silt and clay fractions from McGuill Lake sediment, suggesting that the SOM was relatively undegraded in coarse fractions. The size distribution of OM in the lake could be explained by the weak physical forcing, which may not easily break down coarser plant detritus into smaller pieces. The trend contrasted with degradation patterns for sediments from Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, where SOM was concentrated in the < 32 mu m fraction, which may be due to the strong physical forcing. The physical forcing effects could also explain the attachment of clay minerals to sand grains in both the lake and Nueces Delta because of the relatively weak physical forcing effects, while no clay attachment to sand grains was found at the Copano Bay site because of the strong physical forcing effects. Physical forcing may be an important mechanism in the processing and transport of OM from vascular plants and other organic sources in estuaries and bays before the SOM is exported to coastal oceans.

In this study, we examined the effect of drying on particle size distributions and the rapid (24 h) sorption reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with salt marsh sediments in Nueces Delta, South Texas. Drying reduced the fraction of fine particles in organically richer sediments, indicating structural rearrangement of organic matter and mineral aggregates. Among the 16 EPA priority PAHs examined, dried sediment preferentially released 1.0-7.5% of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene to added seawater (solid: water mass ratio of 1/100)- significantly greater than release from sediments maintained in the wet state. On the other hand, drying also increased the affinity of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) for experimentally amended (deuterated) phenanthrene relative to continually wet sediments. Further, deuterated phenanthrene was even more effectively retained when it was added to wet sediment that was subsequently dried and rewetted.These apparently contradictory results can be reconciled and explained by SOM having a heterogeneous distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones - e.g., a zonal model. We propose that drying changed the orientation of amphiphilic SOM, exposing hydrophobic zones and promoting the release of some of theft native PAHs to water. Freshly amended PAHs were only able to penetrate into the surface hydrophobic zone and/or deeper but rapidly accessible (""kinetics"") zone in wet sediments clue to the brief adsorption contact time. Subsequent drying presumably then induced structural changes in SOM that isolated these amended PAHs in sites inaccessible to water exchange in the next rewetting. These results provide insights into structural changes of SOM upon drying, and help predict the fate of compounds such as organic contaminants during drought/flood oscillations.

To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes.

In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics.

Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106584,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077913513&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106584&partnerID=40&md5=e6a1ecd17713d251da68451818868114,Owers_2020_90075060,"Owers, Christopher J.; Rogers, Kerrylee; Mazumder, Debashish; Woodroffe, Colin D."

During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period.

To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative.

In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.",10.1007/s00248-018-1168-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043696170&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-018-1168-2&partnerID=40&md5=bec71221eea542c930e65bb8a699eb16,Kim_2018_90075017,"Kim, Sunghyun; Kang, Jiyoung; Megonigal, J.

We determined the greenhouse gas balance of a tidal marsh exposed to nine years of experimental carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) manipulation. We estimated net carbon (C) gain rates by measuring changes in plant and soil C pools over nine years. In wetland soils that accrete primarily through organic matter inputs, long-term measurements of soil elevation, along with soil C density, provide a robust estimate of net soil C gain. We used net soil C gain along with methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to determine the radiative forcing of the marsh under elevated CO2 and N addition. Nearly all plots exhibited a net gain of C over the study period (up to 203 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and C gain rates were greater with N and CO2 addition. Treatment effects on C gain and methane emissions dominated trends in radiative forcing while nitrous oxide fluxes in all treatments were negligible. Though these soils experience salinities that typically suppress methane emissions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 can stimulate methane emissions, overcoming positive effects of elevated CO2 on C gain, converting brackish marshes that are typically net greenhouse gas sinks into sources. Adding resources, either CO2 or N, will likely increase ""blue carbon'' accumulation rates in tidal marshes, but importantly, each resource can have distinct influences on the direction of total greenhouse forcing.",10.1007/s10533-017-0312-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014988488&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-017-0312-2&partnerID=40&md5=38333b75a92b85c7a735e89b418a5c2c,Pastore_2017_90075079,"Pastore, Melissa A.; Megonigal, J.

The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years.

Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes.

JOUR,90074835,2016, Europe," Merckx, Roel",author_03,Controls on soil organic carbon stocks in tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient,"Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.",10.5194/bg-13-6611-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006355608&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6611-2016&partnerID=40&md5=7655f8f0776015827d9fb54deb45e299,Van de Broek_2016_90074835,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Temmerman, Stijn; Merckx, Roel; Govers, Gerard"

Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.",10.1111/gcb.14089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042585405&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14089&partnerID=40&md5=ca6b3949132cd145c5ff964e9c7784b3,Van de Broek_2018_90075086,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Vandendriessche, Caroline; Poppelmonde, Dries; Merckx, Roel; Temmerman, Stijn; Govers, Gerard"

The ubiquitous nutrient enrichment of coastal salt marshes stimulating aboveground plant growth may result in higher rates of inorganic matter accumulation that compensates for marsh flooding caused by sea level rise. Results from several short-term experiments, however, demonstrate that root and rhizome biomass and carbon accumulation is reduced with nutrient enrichment, suggesting that eutrophication of coastal waters may not be a compensatory counterbalance to the effects of global sea level rise on salt marshes. We show that the net effects of 36 yr of nutrient enrichment in replicated field experiments do not lead to higher organic or inorganic accumulation. Enrichment reduces organic matter belowground and may result in a significant loss in marsh elevation equivalent to about half the average global sea level rise rates.

Environmental gradients have shown effects on key plant functional traits that subsequently explain ecosystem properties of several systems. However, little is known concerning how associations between plant functional traits, including both below- and aboveground plant components, predict ecosystem properties and independently measured final ecosystem services. Here, we modeled (1) the responses of the leaf and plant economics spectrum, Plant size axis, and root growth to environmental gradients and (2) how associations between plant functional traits explain trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem properties and final services. Forty-four plots were studied in a coastal marsh landscape of the German North Sea Coast. We used a partial least square structural equation model approach to test the hypothesized model. We found (1) a negative covariation between plant traits pertaining to a size axis and traits explaining both plant growth (roots and stems) and the leaf economics spectrum; (2) this trade-off responded significantly to the land use gradient and nutrient availability, which were both strongly driven by the groundwater gradient; (3) this trade-off explained an initial major trade-off between carbon stocks, at one extreme of the axis, and both the habitat value to conserve endangered plants and forage production for meat and dairy products at the other extreme. However, a secondary trade-off between nature conservation value and forage production, explained by a trade-off between leaf economics spectrum and plant growth in response to the land use intensity gradient, was also found.",10.1007/s10661-020-08817-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105798585&doi=10.1007%2fs10661-020-08817-x&partnerID=40&md5=5ca15e31bc346a7db1ebe594212db236,Cebrian-Piqueras_2021_90074705,"Cebrian-Piqueras, Miguel A.; Trinogga, Juliane; Trenkamp, Anastasia; Minden, Vanessa; Maier, Martin; Mantilla-Contreras, Jasmin"
JOUR,90075080,2021, Europe," Minden, Vanessa",author_08,Hydrodynamics affect plant traits in estuarine ecotones with impact on carbon sequestration potentials,"Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that play an important role in carbon fixing. The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream. Due to sea level rise, the area of estuarine vegetation may decrease because a fixed dike line along the river prevents landward migration, which can reduce the amount of biomass produced and with it the potential to store SOC. Restoration of the tidal marshes or realignment of the dikes may be necessary to protect the ecosystem properties and services of estuarine vegetation.",10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107464,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109199501&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107464&partnerID=40&md5=6d5df2c857219b2bf4e8a79ac5a7fb06,Ostermann_2021_90075080,"Ostermann, Tilla Schulte; Kleyer, Michael; Heuner, Maike; Fuchs, Elmar; Temmerman, Stijn; Schoutens, Ken; Bouma, J.

Aiming to investigate sulfate reduction effects over Hg geochemistry in a shallow area (SA) and a salt marsh (SM) from the Patos Estuary, four sediment cores were collected during two distinct hydrological regimes (i.e., freshwater dominated and brackish water dominated). An assessment of free dissolved sulfide (Sigma S-II) concentration and pH in pore water and metals (Fe and Hg), fine grained (<63 mu m) and organic carbon (OC) contents in sediment allowed us to conclude that mercury distribution in SA is chiefly controlled by <63 mu m sediments and metal sulfide formation. Furthermore, redox conditions were relatively stable during both sampling periods. Nevertheless, bioturbation promotes oxygen penetration and subsequent acidification of pore water associated with upper sediment layers in SM, especially during the brackish water period. Most likely, such oxidizing conditions hamper sulfate reduction and, thereafter, Hg immobilization via the formation of metal sulfides.

Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114035745&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2021.120503&partnerID=40&md5=a10c600910c714f7cee95362bb10ec77,Costa_2021_90074624,"Costa, Larissa; Johannesson, Karen; Mirlean, Nicolai; Quintana, Guilherme"

Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores.

Living shorelines are designed to mimic natural fringing marshes and over time should be sinks for carbon and other nutrients. We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2-16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most-but not all-living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades.

A relatively new form of shoreline protection, referred to as hybrid stabilization, incorporates created marsh in combination with a stabilizing structure such as a low-profile stone sill and is being implemented in many US coastal states as a means to not only control erosion but also to restore coastal habitat. However, there has been limited scientific investigation of ecological benefits and impacts associated with implementation of hybrid stabilization. We evaluated relative habitat capacity of marsh-sills by comparing plant, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrate attributes in intertidal and subtidal zones of existing marsh-sills, natural marshes, tidal flats, and riprap revetment within two subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Low and high marsh plant characteristics (stem count and height) of marsh-sills were similar to or greater than natural marshes. However, sediment was coarser, total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were lower, and benthic macrofaunal community structure differed in marsh-sills compared to natural marshes. Marsh-sills supported lower deposit-feeding infaunal biomass than marshes in the intertidal. Epifaunal suspension-feeders were most prevalent at sites with artificial structure (riprap and marsh-sill), but highly variable among subestuaries. Infaunal abundance, biomass, diversity, and proportion of suspension/interface and deposit feeding animals were greater in shallow subtidal than in intertidal environments. Conversion of existing habitat to marsh-sills may cause localized loss of benthic productivity and sediment bioturbation and nutrient-cycling functions, with the opportunity to enhance filtration capacity by epifaunal recruitment to structures. When creating marshes that require structural support, there should be a balance of minimizing loss of existing habitats while encouraging use of suitable structural habitat for suspension-feeders. If properly implemented, the addition of structural habitat could subsidize secondary productivity particularly in areas where loss of complex biogenic habitat (e.g., oyster reefs) has occurred.

Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the East Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2 to 16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: 1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, 2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and 3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands.

When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.",10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b,Luis Marin-Muniz_2014_90074521,"Luis Marin-Muniz, Jose; Hernandez, Maria E.; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved.

The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

JOUR,90075302,2017, Europe," Moreno, F.",author_04,Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries,"This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.",10.1890/10-2037.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051955666&doi=10.1890%2f10-2037.1&partnerID=40&md5=e96b2c3ff336749aa1cda07f28f373eb,Davey_2011_90074559,"Davey, Earl; Wigand, Cathleen; Johnson, Roxanne; Sundberg, Karen; Morris, James; Roman, Charles T."

Goat Island responses to 12 years of nutrient fertilization were an increase in soil organic matter (OM), an increase in number of rhizomes, enlarged rhizome diameters, and increased CO2 emission rates. At soil depths of 10-20 cm, all Debidue creekbank locations had significantly more rhizomes than the reference Crab Haul creekbank.

Denitrification capacity, measured with the isotope pairing technique on a membrane inlet mass spectrometer, was comparable across the sites despite significant differences in above and below ground characteristics. Total extractable ammonium concentrations and sediment carbon content were higher at the natural marsh compared to the restored marsh.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions.

However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the loss of marsh vegetation because of human-driven disturbances such as sea level rise and oil spills can potentially reduce marsh capacity for N removal. To investigate the effect of vegetation loss on ecosystem N removal, we contrasted denitrification capacity in marsh and subtidal sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using a combination of N-29(2) and N-30(2) production (isotope pairing), denitrification potential measurements (acetylene block), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of functional genes in the denitrification pathway. We found that, on average, denitrification capacity was 4 times higher in vegetated sediments because of a combination of enhanced nitrification and higher organic carbon availability. The abundance of nirS-type denitrifers indicated that marsh vegetation regulates the activity, rather than the abundance, of denitrifier communities. We estimated that marsh sediments remove an average of 3.6 t N km(-2) y(-1) compared to 0.9 t N km(-2) y(-1) in unvegetated sediments.

Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal.

Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site.

The denitrifying activity in different soil layers increased gradually over time, and was the highest (93.92%) in 5-10 cm soil layer. The nitrogen loss rate in different soil layers was in accordance with the denitrification rate and denitrifying activity. The contribution rate of denitrification to the nitrogen loss was higher in upper soil layers than in deeper soil layers.

Over all sampling periods, CH4 fluxes averaged between -0.392 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and 0.495 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), and emissions occurred during spring (0.008 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.068 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed during summer (-0.110 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (-0.009 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)).

The annual average CH4 flux from the intertidal zone was 0.002 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), indicating that coastal marsh acted as a weak CH4 source. Temporal variations of CH4 emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (temperatures, soil moisture and salinity) and the variations of limited C and mineral N in sediments, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.This study observed a large spatial variation of CH4 fluxes across the coastal marsh of the Yellow River estuary (CV = 7856.25 %), suggesting that the need to increase the spatial replicates at fine scales before the regional CH4 budget was evaluated precisely. With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.",10.1007/s11104-012-1564-1,NA,Sun_2013_90074736,"Sun, Zhigao; Jiang, Huanhuan; Wang, Lingling; Mou, Xiaojie; Sun, Wanlong"

In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of C, N and S of both soil and (native and invasive) plants in four typical coastal wetlands in the core area of the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The results show that the invasive S. alterniflora greatly influenced soil properties and increased soil C, N and S storage capacity: the stock (mean +/- standard error) of soil organic carbon (SOC, (3.56 +/- 0.36) kg/m(3)), total nitrogen (TN, (0.43 +/- 0.02) kg/m(3)), and total sulfur (TS, (0.69 +/- 0.11) kg/m(3)) in the S. alterniflora marsh exceeded those in the adjacent bare mudflat, Suaeda salsa marsh, and Phragmites australis marsh. Because of its greater biomass, plant C ((1193.7 +/- 133.6) g/m(2)), N ((18.8 +/- 2.4) g/m(2)), and S ((9.4 +/- 1.5) g/m(2)) storage of S. alterniflora was also larger than those of co-occurring native plants. More biogenic elements circulated in the soil-plant system of the S. alterniflora marsh, and their spatial and temporal distribution patterns were also changed by the S. alterniflora invasion. Soil properties changed by S. alterniflora's invasion thereby indirectly affected the accumulation of soil C, N and S in this wetland ecosystem. The SOC, TN, and TS contents were positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and moisture, but negatively correlated with the pH and bulk density of soil. Together, these results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion altered ecosystem processes, resulted in changes in net primary production and litter decomposition, and increased the soil C, N and S storage capacity in the invaded ecosystems in comparison to those with native tallgrass communities in the coastal wetlands of East China.",10.1007/s11769-020-1108-1,NA,Wan_2020_90075308,"Wan, Siang; Liu, Xingtu; Mou, Xiaojie; Zhao, Yongqiang"

This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves.

In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence.

Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.",10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5,Ribeiro_2015_90074622,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Almeida, C.

The contents of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes) and different tissues of J. maritimus. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied, one a sandy sediment with relatively low organic matter content, the other a muddy site. The role of the plant seemed to be markedly dependent on the sediment composition. At the sandy site, significant variations throughout the year (a decrease from winter to summer and an increase in autumn) either in rhizosediment and sediment or in J. maritimus roots were only observed in Cd and Cu levels. These variations were the same in both compartments, probably caused by tidal water movements and the activity of the plant. At the muddy site, variations throughout the year were observed for all studied elements but Pb. Changes in the Cd and Zn contents of roots were opposite to those in the rhizosediment (uptake of Cd and Zn by J maritimus roots in summer may have caused a decrease in rhizosediment levels). Fe and Mn showed similar patterns of variation in both roots and rhizosediment (contents significantly increasing in summer). Higher contents of Fe and Mn in roots in summer could be related to changes in mass, higher availability of the elements, or accumulation at the surface of the root in (hydr)oxides forms. For the remaining elements no significant correlations between rhizosediment and roots variations were observed, indicating that their uptake and release by roots were not based on single exchanges with the sediment.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants.

Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

Four modern transects collected from three tidal environments at Siletz Bay, Oregon, USA, produced three elevation-dependent groups in both the foraminiferal and delta C-13/bulk geochemistry datasets. Foraminiferal samples from the tidal flat and low marsh are identified by Miliammina fusca abundances of >45%, middle and high marsh by M. fusca abundances of <45% and the highest marsh by Trochamminita irregularis abundances >25%.

Living and dead foraminiferal species from 10 stations were analyzed over two successive years in the summer (dry) and fall (wet) seasons. There were insignificant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the distribution of live and dead species. But there was a noticeable decrease in calcareous assemblages (Haynesina sp.) between live populations and dead assemblages, indicating that most of the calcareous tests were dissolved after burial; the agglutinated assemblages were comparable between constituents. The live populations and dead assemblages were dominated by Miliammina fusca in the tidal flat and low marsh, Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata and M. fusca in the high marsh, and Trochamminita irregularis and Balticammina pseudomacrescens in the highest marsh to upland. Geochemical analyses (VC, TOC and C/N of bulk sedimentary organic matter) show no significant influence of inter-annual variations but a significant correlation of PC values (R = -0.820, p < 0.001), TOC values (R = 0.849, p < 0.001) and C/N ratios (R = 0.885, p < 0.001) to elevation with respect to the tidal frame.

Intertidal biostabilization has been well studied in temperate and subtropical environments, but little is known for subarctic conditions with strong seasonal changes in vegetation cover and sea ice presence in winter because of the difficulty in studying the sediments under ice cover. The present project investigated the role of biofilms and their seasonal as well as spatial variations for sediment biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal area near Rimouski (Quebec, Canada). Grain size distribution reflected a seaward increasing trend in sand content and mean grain size. The poor sorting of sediments results from the contribution of sediment transport by ice rafting in addition to the hydrodynamic transport processes in this subarctic intertidal area. A Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) was used to measure the erosion threshold (tau(crit)) across the entire intertidal area. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and extra polymeric substances (EPS) were measured in the top 3 mm. The high marsh had a far higher tau(crit) than the low marsh, but there was much less variation between low marsh, mudflat and sandflat. tau(crit )was significantly correlated with Chl a, elevation, and organic matter content. EPS was not a good indicator for tau(crit), except for the low marsh/high marsh difference. The results showed a seasonal cycle in intertidal bed emdibility. Lower intertidal areas had highest tau(crit) in autumn during the storm season, followed by lowest tau(crit) in winter under sea-ice cover, and no major difference between summer and spring.

Multiple linear regressions of 203 samples of marsh surface sediments show that grain size gets finer and organic matter content increases with distance from the lagoon inlet, the sandy peninsula, the closest creek, and the lagoon. The vegetation parameters and surface microtopography have only a minor influence. Locally, grain size can get finer with elevation, while organic matter content increases. However, across the entire marsh, grain size exhibits the opposite trend with elevation, a consequence of aeolian transport and ice rafting. The 94 samples covering the lagoon show a trend of finer grain size with distance from the lagoon inlet and with sea grass cover. Penouille marsh has been relatively stable from 1975 to 2008: analysis of five georeferenced aerial photographs shows that only 3% of the marsh area was lost due to outer marsh edge retreat. Ten sediment cores collected in the marsh show a thickness of 0.14-0.72 m of marsh sediments overlying a sandy substrate. Radiocarbon dates suggest that marsh establishment occurred in the north side of the lagoon around 1000-1200 cal BP. Accretion rates based on radiocarbon dates are 0.4-1 mm/y for several centuries, whereas Cs-137 dating indicates rates of 1-3 mm/y since 1963, and accretion plates indicate 2.9 0.9 mm/y between 2010 and 2012. Accretion rates since 1963 are similar to the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) of 1.5 mm/y at Penouille for the 1969-2014 period.

In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS C-14 chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat.

However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer.

JOUR,90075473,2020,NA," Nie, Ming",author_03,"Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on saltmarsh nitrogen removal in the Yangtze River Estuary, China","Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

It is argued that this depletion in delta(13)C of organic matter in marsh sediments is due to trapping of allochthonous organic matter which is depleted in C-13. The isotopic composition and concentration of organic carbon are used in a simple mass balance to constrain the amount of plant material accumulating in marsh sediments, i.e. in terms of the so-called net ecosystem production. Net ecosystem production (similar to 2-100 g C m(-2) year(-1)) is a small fraction (1-5%) of plant production (similar to 2000 g C m(-2) year(-1)).

From May 1983 to May 1985 the local pollution of this marsh with metals and fluoride was investigated. Samples from soil and vegetation were analysed monthly for cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, manganese, iron, and fluoride. The amount of these substances in the soil appeared to be related to both the percentage of clay particles and organic matter in the soil and to the frequency of tidal submergences. In vegetation, the pollutants clearly showed a seasonal variation. Adherent clay, deposited on the plants during submergences, contributed considerably to the total amount of these elements. Sheep grazing in the marsh were investigated for renal and faecal excretion of these elements, but no relation between these samples and the seasonal variation in vegetation was found. Presumably sheep consumed vegetation selectively, avoiding the more contaminated plants. Regular clinical inspection of the sheep revealed no signs of acute or chronic intoxication. The organs of sheep that died during the investigation showed increased levels of cadmium in the liver and kidney, and iron in the liver, but not enough to cause alarm. Fluoride found in the rib material, although slightly increased, did not indicate fluorosis. In conclusion, contamination with metals and fluoride, as observed in the salt marsh, apparently does not impair the health of locally grazing sheep. This may be due to selective consumption behaviour of the sheep, their stabling during the winter, limited biological availability of the elements studied, and a sheep management adapted to the local circumstances.",10.1080/01652176.1988.9694155,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023989262&doi=10.1080%2f01652176.1988.9694155&partnerID=40&md5=53eb024746d3e3c7fef556b9a7f781c9,Baars_1988_90075433,"Baars, A.J.; van Beek, H.; Spierenburg, T.J.; Beeftink, W.G.; Nieuwenhuize, J.; Pekelder, J.J.; Boom, J."

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens.

Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators.

Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators.

Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

JOUR,90074808,2006,NA," Noe, Gregory B.",author_03,The contribution of leaching to the rapid release of nutrients and carbon in the early decay of wetland vegetation,"Our goal was to quantify the coupled process of litter turnover and leaching as a source of nutrients and fixed carbon in oligotrophic, nutrient-limited wetlands. We conducted poisoned and non-poisoned incubations of leaf material from four different perennial wetland plants (Eleocharis spp., Cladium jamaicense, Rhizophora mangle and Spartina alterniflora) collected from different oligotrophic freshwater and estuarine wetland settings. Total phosphorus (TP) release from the P-limited Everglades plant species (Eleocharis spp., C. jamaicense and R. mangle) was much lower than TP release by the salt marsh plant S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet (SC). For most species and sampling times, total organic carbon (TOC) and TP leaching losses were much greater in poisoned than non-poisoned treatments, likely as a result of epiphytic microbial activity. Therefore, a substantial portion of the C and P leached from these wetland plant species was bio-available to microbial communities. Even the microbes associated with S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet showed indications of P-limitation early in the leaching process, as P was removed from the water column. Leaves of R. mangle released much more TOC per gram of litter than the other species, likely contributing to the greater waterborne [DOC] observed by others in the mangrove ecotone of Everglades National Park. Between the two freshwater Everglades plants, C. jamaicense leached nearly twice as much P than Eleocharis spp. In scaling this to the landscape level, our observed leaching losses combined with higher litter production of C. jamaicense compared to Eleocharis spp. resulted in a substantially greater P leaching from plant litter to the water column and epiphytic microbes. In conclusion, leaching of fresh plant litter can be an important autochthonous source of nutrients in freshwater and estuarine wetland ecosystems.",10.1007/s10750-006-0124-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33746768711&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-006-0124-1&partnerID=40&md5=e6f94493eb3a0439ccb59487b37bd385,Davis_2006_90074808,"Davis, Stephen E., III; Childers, Daniel L.; Noe, Gregory B."

Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.",10.1029/2018GB005897,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047623402&doi=10.1029%2f2018GB005897&partnerID=40&md5=e45660cdfbade7aea8c8ed4eaf9f93a9,Krauss_2018_90075283,"Krauss, Ken W.; Noe, Gregory B.; Duberstein, Jamie A.; Conner, William H.; Stagg, Camille L.; Cormier, Nicole; Jones, Miriam C.; Bernhardt, Christopher E.; Lockaby, B.

JOUR,90074564,2019, Europe," Nolte, Stefanie",author_04,Origin of organic carbon in the topsoil of Wadden Sea salt marshes,"Blue carbon ecosystems, including salt marshes, play an important role in the global carbon cycle because of their high-efficiency storage of organic carbon (OC) in soils. Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock. These findings thereby yield important implications for carbon crediting and land-use management.",10.3354/meps13009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067861084&doi=10.3354%2fmeps13009&partnerID=40&md5=bc62d06f19bfb0a7c2f3f0f0c2140fe2,Mueller_2019_90074564,"Mueller, Peter; Hai Thi Do; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"
JOUR,90074609,2019, Europe," Nolte, Stefanie",author_07,Assessing the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of the semi-natural salt marshes in the European Wadden Sea,"Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.",10.1002/ecs2.2556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010,Mueller_2019_90074609,"Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"
JOUR,90075095,2017,NA," Nolte, Stefanie",author_03,Data from: Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils,"Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

The subterranean estuary, the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and sea water in a coastal aquifer, has a high potential to remove substantial N. A network of piezometers was used to characterize the denitrification capacity and groundwater flow paths in the subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh. ""N-enriched nitrate was injected into the subterranean estuary (in situ push-pull method) to evaluate the denitrification capacity of the saturated zone at multiple depths (125300 cm) below different zones (upland-marsh transition zone, high marsh, and low marsh). From the upland to low marsh, the water table became shallower, groundwater dissolved oxygen decreased, and groundwater pH, soil organic carbon, and total root biomass increased. As groundwater approached the high and low marsh, the hydraulic gradient increased and deep groundwater upwelled. In the warm season (groundwater temperature > 12 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity within each zone was observed. The warm season low marsh groundwater denitrification capacity was significantly higher than all other zones and depths. In the cool season (groundwater temperature < 10.5 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity was only found in the low marsh. Additions of dissolved organic carbon did not alter groundwater denitrification capacity suggesting that an alternative electron donor, possibly transported by tidal inundation from the root zone, may be limiting. Combining flow paths with denitrification capacity and saturated porewater residence time, we estimated that as much as 29-60 mg N could be removed from 11 of water flowing through the subterranean estuary below the low marsh, arguing for the significance of subterranean estuaries in annual watershed scale N budgets.",10.1007/BF02696018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-31144457667&doi=10.1007%2fBF02696018&partnerID=40&md5=0befedec4a28888fceff3be83a6c0794,Addy_2005_90075122,"Addy, K.; Gold, A.; Nowicki, B.; McKenna, J.; Stolt, M.; Groffman, P."

Salt marshes, because of their location between upland regions and coastal waters and their recognized role as nutrient transformers, have the potential to ameliorate some of this loading. In the current study, we used core incubations in the laboratory to investigate denitrification rates in high marsh soils from five fringing salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. The marshes showed a wide variety of terrestrial N loading, with rates ranging from 2 to 6037 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Field-collected cores were selected to include both vegetated and bare soils at each marsh, and the six-hour incubations were designed to approximate natural tidal rhythms. Total dissolved nitrogen flux in these marshes ranged between + 1255 and -710 mumol N m(-2) hr(-1), with N-2 gas accounting for the majority of the total N flux (average 76%). Nitrogen gas flux ranged between -375 (nitrogen fixation) and +420 (denitrification) mumol N-2 m(-2) hr(-1). While N-2 gas fluxes were significantly correlated (r = +0.64, p < 0.05) with marsh organic carbon content, we also detected a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.91, P < 0.05) between average N-2 gas fluxes and terrestrial nitrogen loads. Comparison of N-2 gas fluxes in vegetated vs. bare soils indicated a significant (p < 0.05) but variable effect of vegetation on N-2 flux. This field survey shows the potential of New England fringe salt marshes to intercept and transform land-derived nitrogen loads; however, sediment characteristics (e.g., percent of labile organic matter) and plant community structure can significantly affect the capacity of the marsh to process inorganic nitrogen loads. In order to understand the role of salt marshes in buffering coastal N loading, we need a better understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling denitrification and net N losses.",10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0870:DIFSMO]2.0.CO;2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-25144451281&doi=10.1672%2f0277-5212%282004%29024%5b0870%3aDIFSMO%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=0bb6f51595868df50088d819b9994986,Davis_2004_90075469,"Davis, J.L.; Nowicki, B.; Wigand, C."

Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and reclaimed for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canadas Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.",10.1007/s12237-018-0442-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052137156&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-0442-3&partnerID=40&md5=c787996bb4df80de55eaf84eaf931ca9,Simpson_2019_90074980,"Simpson, L.

Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise.

Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon.

Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment into Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (i.e., root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (i.e., carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground tissues compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.",10.1111/1365-2745.12571,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962537858&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2745.12571&partnerID=40&md5=48c28dacd9dcbd96acc54942480c13c1,Yando_2016_90074735,"Yando, Erik S.; Osland, Michael J.; Willis, Jonathan M.; Day, Richard H.; Krauss, Ken W.; Hester, Mark W."

The sequential extraction procedure proposed by Tessier was used to estimate the percentages of the metals present in each geochemical phase of the sediment. Metal concentrations in the solid phase were found to be enriched in the upper layers and mainly associated with reactive fractions such as organic matter, Fe - Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates (46 - 74% of Ni, Mn and Cd, and 11 - 19% of Cu and Zn). Principal factor analysis (PFA) and Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association of metals and their reactive phases with OC (the diagenetic component), and a negative or non-association with the mud content, Al, Fe and Li (the lithogenic component). Diagenetically released metals are mainly mobilized within hypersaline sediments by buoyancy transport (> 90% of total flux) in response to an extreme salinity gradient by input of fresh groundwater (3 - 6 psu cm(-1)). The. molecular diffusion due to the gradient of metals in porewater (maximum and higher levels at 5 - 7 and below 20 cm depth, respectively) is significantly less important to the advective transport. Most of the metals mobilized by diffusion - advection processes are re-precipitated in the sediments by authigenic minerals, only < 10% of most metals are extruded out to the overlying water column. Authigenic accumulation rates were estimated as 1.42 - 7.09 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Cd; 58.8 - 378 for Cu; 6922 - 17,985 for Fe; 38.2 - 345 for Mn; 20.8 - 263 for Ni; and 282 - 2956 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Zn. The Mn - Fe oxyhydroxides (40 - 85% of reactive metals) in the upper oxic - suboxic layers (< 5 cm below surface) and sulfide minerals (75 - 97%) in anoxic sediment layers (7 - 18 cm) constitute the main scavengers for metals.

In addition, we measured the stable isotopic composition of Pb in order to distinguish its input sources. Concentrations of Pb increased from low or background values in the bottommost layer (<60 cm depth), followed by fluctuations in the middle layer (20-60 cm) and peak values in the subsurface layer (3-5 cm). Pb associated to reactive fractions (e.g. OM, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates) accounted for 60% of that initially deposited. Stable Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-207/Pb-208) suggested that most of the Pb in the upper sediments (1.204 +/- 0.002 and 2.469 +/- 0.007) is still derived from the leaded gasoline combustion (1.201 +/- 0.006 and 2.475 +/- 0.005). Profile of dissolved Pb was related to those for ammonium, phosphates and dissolve Fe and Mn, which reveals the influence of the diagenetic reactions on the Pb behavior. OM. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and the sulfide minerals play a significant role for mobilizing and trapping the Pb. Metal mobilization was calculated considering an advective-diffusive system. The advective process constitutes the dominant mechanism of Pb mobilization. A low diffusive outflux with respect to the Pb mobilization rate suggested that most of the released Pb is retained in the sediments. Authigenic oxides precipitated at the oxic-suboxic layers (0-4 cm depth) and authigenic sulfide minerals formed Pb in the anoxic layers (7-20 cm depth) constituting the main scavengers for Pb that is diagenetically released. This retention has significant environmental implications because it reduces the availability and toxicity of Pb to biota, including humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

JOUR,90074967,2016,NA," Pan, Genxing",author_11,Microbial activity promoted with organic carbon accumulation in macroaggregates of paddy soils under long-term rice cultivation,"While soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stabilization has been increasingly the focus of ecosystem properties, how it could be linked to soil biological activity enhancement has been poorly assessed. In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.",10.5194/bg-13-6565-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006367236&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6565-2016&partnerID=40&md5=d57a008abcef0f9470eec299deab60ff,Liu_2016_90074967,"Liu, Yalong; Wang, Ping; Ding, Yuanjun; Lu, Haifei; Li, Lianqing; Cheng, Kun; Zheng, Jufeng; Filley, Timothy; Zhang, Xuhui; Zheng, Jinwei; Pan, Genxing"

Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation.

Radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137), stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15), organic matter concentrations and nutrient concentrations were measured. Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1). The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites (mostly >= 1% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5% N), decreased to approximately 0.6% N by 1940, and then remained constant to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3 plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level. Surface sediments in all of the cores have more total phosphorus (TP) than below ground. The downstream site closest to the estuary had an abrupt increase in surface TP (i.e., 0-10 cm). Sediment TP increased slightly from 2003 to present time (i.e., from 0.07 to 0.11% P).

Measurements of radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137) and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) were accompanied by nutrient and organic matter concentrations. Sediment accumulation rates, measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology, ranged from 48 to 81 mg cm(2) y(-1), whereas corresponding accretion rates ranged from 0.16 to 0.30 cm y(-1). Sediment nitrogen (N) accumulation rates increased twofold at an upper bay site, starting in the mid-1950s, whereas at other locations, only small to no increases were seen with time. Phosphorus (P) accumulation was minimal with time. N and P accumulation rates were higher between the 1940s to 1950s at stations BB-1 and BB-3, while higher accumulation rate in the down-bay (BB-4) was identified in the early 1990s. Results indicate that bay marshes can sequester approximately 79 +/- 11% of N and 54 +/- 34% of P entering the Bay from upland sources; thus, these marshes perform an important ecosystem service in the form of nutrient sequestration.

Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM).

Focusing on the arthropod community in the dominant salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora, we tested two hypotheses: first, that marsh community structure varies geographically, and second, that two aspects of marsh function (response to eutrophication and addition of dead plant material) also vary geographically. We worked at eleven sites on the Gulf Coast and eleven sites on the Atlantic Coast, dividing each coast up into two geographic areas. Abiotic conditions (tidal range, soil organic content, and water content, but not soil salinity), plant variables (Spartina nitrogen content, height, cover of dead plant material, but not live Spartina percent cover or light interception), and arthropod variables (proportional abundances of predators, sucking herbivores, stem-boring herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, but not total arthropod numbers) varied among the four geographic regions. Latitude and mean tidal range explained much of this geographic variation. Nutrient enrichment increased all arthropod functional groups in the community, consistent with previous experimental results, and had similar effects in all geographic regions, contrary to our hypothesis, suggesting widespread consistency in this aspect of ecosystem function. The addition of dead plant material had surprisingly little effect on the arthropod community. Our results caution against the uncritical extrapolation of work done in one geographic region to another, but indicate that some aspects of marsh function may operate in similar ways in different geographic regions, despite spatial variation in community structure.",10.1007/s00442-012-2352-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867564461&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-012-2352-6&partnerID=40&md5=a9c5f42e657cd0caa60fbbc3da7b15b6,McCall_2012_90074834,"McCall, Brittany D.; Pennings, Steven C."
JOUR,90074917,2020,NA," Pennings, Steven C.",author_06,Quantifying how changing mangrove cover affects ecosystem carbon storage in coastal wetlands,"Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.",10.1002/ecy.2916,NA,Charles_2020_90074917,"Charles, Sean P.; Kominoski, John S.; Armitage, Anna R.; Guo, Hongyu; Weaver, Carolyn A.; Pennings, Steven C."

We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation.

The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.",10.1007/s00442-012-2356-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867501387&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-012-2356-2&partnerID=40&md5=1ad42024ac95f1ab7f473d1a884c9b45,Guo_2012_90075289,"Guo, Hongyu; Pennings, Steven C."

Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored.

However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively.

However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity.

The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.HighlightsDenitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.",10.1111/ejss.12956,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083381567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12956&partnerID=40&md5=1111fdd770769b6d9af5ca6ed5172cd6,Hu_2021_90075266,"Hu, Minjie; Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi; Huang, Jiafang; Xu, Kang; Tong, Chuan"

We have investigated the relationships between stocks of different soil organic carbon (SOC) along the soil vertical profile and invasive plant success in a China wetland. In stands dominated by the exotic invasive species Spartina alterniflora and the native invasive Phragmites australis soil organic-carbon concentrations (SOC) were higher (12% and 9%, respectively) than in plots of a native species, Cyperus malaccensis, whereas SOC content (g m(-2) ) was 18% and 17% lower under P. australis than under S. alterniffolia and C. malaccensis, respectively. Soils under both invasive species had the concentrations and contents of light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC), light-fraction organic nitrogen (LFON) at 30-60 cm of soil depth and labile organic carbon (LOC) concentrations at 0-10 cm higher than soils under native species. The invasive species had higher total aboveground, total biomasses and lower shoot:root ratios than the native species. The success of both invasive species was associated with higher growth rates and accumulation of nutrients in biomass than in the native species and also accumulation of C in plant soil system. The stands currently dominated by the invasive species were recently occupied by monospecific stands of the native C. malaccensis, strongly suggesting that all or most of the current soil differences were due to the invasions. Higher sand fraction in C. malaccensis community and higher clay fraction in P. australis community relative to the native species, were correlated with higher soil N and P concentrations in invaded stands. The results suggest that different vegetation cover with distinct shoot/root ratio can change soil structure by favoring sedimentation of different particle size classes. Thus, despite both invasive species have some common traits, the results also showed that different invasive species with partially distinct impacts on soil and nutrient uses can succeed under the same conditions. The traits conferring invasive success are thus not necessarily species-specific.

Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon.

Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once.

A strong north-to-south salinity gradient in the study area was a major factor influencing composition of diatom assemblages. Subtidal sediments, especially in highly productive areas in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay, contained a high proportion of planktonic diatoms, especially small-celled Cyclotella and Chaetoceros species. Habitat type and physical properties, such as particle size and depth, were other important factors structuring diatom assemblages. Water-column nutrients and sediment contaminants did not show much effect on sediment diatoms, possibly due to the overriding effect of salinity or low variability in nutrient/ contaminant concentrations. However, the organic matter content of sediments was significantly related to diatom species composition. Both sediment carbon and nitrogen were considerably higher in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay and other areas experiencing strong human impacts.

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens.

Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat.

For our study of the effect of edaphic factors on vegetation we chose Long Point in Moulting Lagoon, Tasmania's largest saltmarsh, which is dominated by a diverse assemblage of halophytic succulents and graminoids. Three transects were established to sample variations in vegetation along the gradient from saltmarsh to woodland. Soil samples were analysed for summer and winter moisture, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC); a mixed summer and winter sample from each point was analysed for soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon. Additionally, a particle size analysis was carried out on all summer samples. Aspects of soil characteristics were aligned to classified vegetation groups and elevation. Moisture, pH, EC, SOM and carbon were all negatively correlated with elevation; the saltmarsh zone displaying higher levels of all variables than those in the adjacent woodland zone. Clay content decreased and sand content increased from the marine margin of the saltmarsh zone to the woodland zone. Within the saltmarsh zone, soil moisture, EC and carbon had highest values in the low marsh area, with values decreasing towards the upper marsh area.

However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.",10.1007/s11707-018-0680-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045061365&doi=10.1007%2fs11707-018-0680-5&partnerID=40&md5=66f99ad575a52e872053b662566736d2,Li_2018_90074600,"Li, Jianguo; Yang, Wenhui; Li, Qiang; Pu, Lijie; Xu, Yan; Zhang, Zhongqi; Liu, Lili"

We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh.

However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition.

JOUR,90074439,2006,NA," Qin, Pei",author_04,"The flux of methyl chloride along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh, Eastern China","Salt marshes have been suggested to be a large potential source for methyl chloride (CH3Cl) that is the major natural carrier of chlorine to the stratosphere. However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

Impacts of S. alterniflora on the inter-tidal macrobenthos community in the Jiangsu coastland are addressed by comparing the macrobenthos characteristics in a mudflat and in a four-year-old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. During the period October 2002-July 2003, we studied the distribution pattern and diversity of macrobenthos, and discussed their correlation with environmental factors caused by Spartina vegetation. The results showed that a total of 43 macrobenthos species were found, mainly consisting of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Annelida. Ten macrobenthos species were found in the Spartina salt marsh, and 36 species were found in the mudflat. Life forms and functional groups of macrobenthos in the Spartina salt marsh were obviously distrinct from that of the mudflat. The study showed that macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh decreased, and the community structure altered obviously, whereas the biomass showed no differences in different seasons. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seasonal change of macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh negatively related to content of sediment organic matter, total N, bulk density, height and biomass of Spartina vegetation, and positively related to the density of Spartina. All these differences suggested the obvious effects of the Spartina vegetation on the Jiangsu inter-tidal benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. Furthermore, the investigation also showed that the niche of the native macrobenthos living in the mudflat has been transferred down, seaward, due to the invasion of Spartina in our study site.

JOUR,90075324,2006,NA," Qin, Pei",author_04,Removal of methyl chloroform in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China,"The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH3CCl3 emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114035745&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2021.120503&partnerID=40&md5=a10c600910c714f7cee95362bb10ec77,Costa_2021_90074624,"Costa, Larissa; Johannesson, Karen; Mirlean, Nicolai; Quintana, Guilherme"

Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core.

We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.",10.23818/limn.38.42,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068908899&doi=10.23818%2flimn.38.42&partnerID=40&md5=2c67bdc9ead6e170e0933ee9d9300432,Cabrera_2019_90074335,"Cabrera, Santiago; Compte, Jordi; Gascon, Stephanie; Boix, Dani; Cunillera-Montcusi, David; Barrero, Lucas; Quintana, Xavier D."

However, less is known about the influence of ecosystem size on environmental characteristics; for example, do larger ecosystems have higher nutrient availability? The nature of this relationship is important for gaining a better understanding of whether the effects of ecosystem size on community functioning are direct or indirect. Indirect effects may exist when the environmental characteristics of larger ecosystems are different from those of smaller ones, and thus the different functioning of communities observed along the ecosystem-size gradient may respond to, for instance, different levels of nutrient availability, and not uniquely to different ecosystem sizes. Here, we tested whether the environmental characteristics (i.e., the physical, chemical and biological characteristics) of temporary ponds of various sizes differed. We chose temporary ponds because they are abiotic controlled systems in which abiotic factors have a strong influence on aquatic communities. However, temporary ponds are usually spatially clustered; consequently, pond locality might also be important in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond (i.e., ponds close to one another may share similar features). We therefore examined whether pond locality is a more important factor than size in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond. To do so, we sampled environmental characteristics (chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, macrophyte biomass, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and total organic and inorganic carbon) of ponds in 5 different localities. A cluster of ponds (10 to 12) was sampled in each locality. Ponds encompassing a wide range of sizes were selected for sampling within each locality. We also performed a meta-analysis (including data from 27 temporary pond localities) to investigate whether the environmental characteristics of the ponds sampled in this study were representative of Mediterranean temporary ponds, and thus if such characteristics could be used to distinguish between Mediterranean temporary ponds from temporary ponds located outside of the Mediterranean region. Our results showed that locality had a strong effect on the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds, whereas size had only a weak influence; only chlorophyll-a and pond depth showed a robust relationship with size, as both increased with pond size independently of locality. Moreover, our results suggest that the typology of the temporary pond (i.e., if they were mountain temporary ponds, salt marsh ponds or lowland ponds) had a larger influence on several environmental characteristics than did regional location (i.e., Mediterranean).",NA,NA,Ballon_2016_90074961,"Ballon, Cecilia; Avila, Nuria; Boix, Dani; Lopez-Flores, Rocio; Romo, Susana; Sala, Jordi; Quintana, Xavier D.; Gascon, Stephanie"
JOUR,90074586,1800,NA," Quirk, Tracy",author_02,Soil microbial community development across a 32-year coastal wetland restoration time series and the relative importance of environmental factors,"Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystem functioning through processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling, and regulating vegetation structure and productivity. Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153359,NA,Abbott_1800_90074586,"Abbott, Katherine M; Quirk, Tracy; Fultz, Lisa M"

JOUR,90075221,2019,NA," Quirk, Tracy",author_02,Dataset: Factors influencing blue carbon accumulation across a 32‐year chronosequence of created coastal marshes,"Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from 12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 , which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees.

Since many metal pollutants are highly redox sensitive, a better understanding of the effects of redox on metal speciation in estuarine sediments is useful for management of the coastal environment.

The recovery of the mangroves was measured by assessing changes in vegetation cover and sediment characteristics along transects and all mangroves present in the estuary were described in terms of height, diameter at breast height and phenology. Measurements were made in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. Surviving adult trees were producing propagules and showed that the forest would be able to regenerate if the seedlings established and were able to survive the environmental conditions. However there may be competition from salt marsh plants which increased in average cover from 0% in 2011 to 18.9% (2013) and 50% in 2015. Sediment characteristics changed over the study period with more oxic conditions in 2013 and 2015 (57.6 and 62.3 mV) compared to 2011 and 2012 (-189 to -148 mV) and organic matter decreased from 18.4% in 2011 to 9.8% in 2015. High initial porewater nutrient concentrations in 2013 promoted salt marsh growth.

The aims of the current study were to compare the biomass allocation of Salicornia tegetaria in six estuaries and relate findings to their environmental conditions. The current study measured the physico-chemical variables of the sediment (moisture content, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, pH) and pore water (temperature, salinity, pH, depth) at Olifants, Berg, Langebaan, Heuningnes, Nahoon and Kwelerha estuaries. Above and below ground biomass and stem height measurements were also collected. The below ground biomass (1.51 +/- 0.24 kg m(-2)) and root/shoot ratio (1.36 +/- 0.17) was the lowest at Heuningnes Estuary with no significant difference at the remaining estuaries, suggesting that factors, such as geomorphology and sedimentological processes, could have a stronger effect on the biomass allocation in this species. Important drivers of biomass allocation were sediment pH, redox potential and pore water depth.

Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02582.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857137924&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2486.2011.02582.x&partnerID=40&md5=cfd1e9fdd645bf9256f6b61fc8bb3138,Macreadie_2012_90074734,"Macreadie, Peter I.; Allen, Katie; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Ralph, Peter J.; Skilbeck, Charles G."

The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.",10.1111/gcb.13158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959542967&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13158&partnerID=40&md5=ae6ac69953785c11337ea555ade94708,Kelleway_2016_90074929,"Kelleway, Jeffrey J.; Saintilan, Neil; Macreadie, Peter I.; Skilbeck, Charles G.; Zawadzki, Atun; Ralph, Peter J."

Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.",10.1007/s10533-013-9841-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884908191&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-013-9841-5&partnerID=40&md5=81ab1ba74ae73fb8e9a3d9c5834953a4,Chambers_2013_90074425,"Chambers, Lisa G.; Osborne, Todd Z.; Reddy, K.

Total elemental contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate temporal variations in trace elements in soil profiles of the three salt marshes, assess the enrichment levels and ecological risks of these trace elements in three sampling seasons and identify their influencing factors. Trace elements did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in T. chinensis wetland. Compared to other elements, both Cd and As had higher enrichment factors exceeding moderate enrichment levels. However, the toxic unit (TU) values of these trace elements did not exceed probable effect levels. Correlation analysis showed that these trace elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture, sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values. Principal component analysis showed that the sampling season affected by the flow-sediment regulation regime was the dominant factor influencing the distribution patterns of these trace elements in soils, and plant community type was another important factor.

Direct denitrification was higher than coupled denitrification in all seasons. Denitrification rates were higher in WLD despite lower %OM, lower total N concentration, and higher BD in wetland soils.

Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)).

JOUR,90075026,2020,NA," Rogers, Kerrylee",author_04,Contemporary distribution of benthic foraminiferal assemblages in coastal wetlands of south-eastern Australia,"Benthic foraminifera identified from the upper intertidal zone of coastal mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands of south-eastern Australia exhibit spatial zonation that varies with elevation and corresponds to position in the tidal frame. This study describes relationships between benthic foraminiferal assemblages and environmental variables, such as wetland elevation, pore-water salinity, substrate organic matter content and sediment grainsize. Agglutinated taxa dominated higher in the tidal frame, whereas calcareous taxa increased in both relative abundance and diversity lower in the tidal frame. Species composition varied within and between study sites, reflecting local differences in other environmental variables. Three major spatial clusters were identified in the upper intertidal zone from a dataset consisting of 111 contemporary samples: a high-to mid-elevation assemblage consisting of differing abundances of Entzia macrescens and Trochammina inflata; a mid-elevation assemblage comprised of Arenoparrella mexicana in association with Trochammina inflata and Quinqueloculina seminula; and mid-to low-elevation assemblage characterised by Cribroelphidium excavatum, Quinqueloculina seminula, Ammobaculites spp. and Miliammina fusca. Multivariate analysis correlated foraminiferal assemblages with environmental variables showing that foraminiferal distribution in the region is constrained primarily by wetland elevation, but also by pore-water salinity. Foraminiferal assemblages derived from cluster analysis correlated with vegetation zones, implying that both foraminifera and vegetation are influenced by elevation and salinity. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the consistency in spatial zonation of assemblages provides greater confidence that contemporary distribution of foraminiferal assemblages can assist with the interpretation of past depositional conditions and palaeo-environmental reconstructions, providing insights into the evolution of coastal wetlands of south-eastern Australia over the Holocene.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106949,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090215169&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106949&partnerID=40&md5=39a90a96bc59b4be76b5c729191307a5,Lal_2020_90075026,"Lal, Kirti K.; Bonetti, Carla; Woodroffe, Colin D.; Rogers, Kerrylee"
JOUR,90075060,2020,NA," Rogers, Kerrylee",author_02,Temperate coastal wetland near-surface carbon storage: Spatial patterns and variability,"Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous, nevertheless are commonly described on the basis of vegetation distribution within the intertidal zone. Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106584,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077913513&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106584&partnerID=40&md5=e6a1ecd17713d251da68451818868114,Owers_2020_90075060,"Owers, Christopher J.; Rogers, Kerrylee; Mazumder, Debashish; Woodroffe, Colin D."

However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

JOUR,90074552,2015,NA," Rosenheim, Brad E.",author_02,What happens to soil organic carbon as coastal marsh ecosystems change in response to increasing salinity? An exploration using ramped pyrolysis,"Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands.",10.1002/2015GC005839,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939571985&doi=10.1002%2f2015GC005839&partnerID=40&md5=05efb0e8962e7cafb086bddfb225baf1,Williams_2015_90074552,"Williams, Elizabeth K.; Rosenheim, Brad E."

However, this temporal information is often difficult to interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C-14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C-14 age spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C-14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C-14 ages within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C-14 ages from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C-14 ages from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<<300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C-14 age of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C-14 ages also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise.",10.1002/2016GC006526,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010685610&doi=10.1002%2f2016GC006526&partnerID=40&md5=9a08e365e8bc57c0f2cd3d83a393a566,Vetter_2017_90074753,"Vetter, Lael; Rosenheim, Brad E.; Fernandez, Alvaro; Tornqvist, Torbjoern E."

Trace element contamination was negligible in seagrass sediments, but minor to severe, depending on the element, in salt marsh cores, owing to higher organic carbon and fine sediment contents. EF temporal variation in salt marsh cores was attributed to agriculture technology changes (e.g. installation of greenhouses, and improved irrigation and fertilization systems).

Because of its low relief, population increase and economic development during the last century, the Celestun lagoon is highly vulnerable to global change, including sea level rise. Here, we study a sediment core from a tropical saltmarsh to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on sediment accretion and carbon fluxes. Some geochemical indicators in a Pb-210 dated sediment core showed clear signals of marine influence. This was reflected on increased accretion rates, from 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1) in 1941 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 mm yr(-1) in 2012. These accretion rates were similar to eustatic sea level rise, and mean acceleration ranged from 0.037-0.22 mm yr(-2) implying a SLR by 2100 ranging from 14 to 86 cm.

Infauna density and species richness (per 7.07 cm(2) core) achieved equivalence to comparable reference marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Taxa with dispersing larval stages (e.g. Streblospio benedicti, Capitella sp.) achieved equivalence within 3 yr following marsh creation. Taxa that lack a planktonic dispersal stage, such as tubificid oligochaetes and Manayunkia aesturina, were slower to develop. Densities of Manayunkia did not achieve equivalence to natural marshes until 8 yr after marsh creation. Twenty-five yr elapsed before oligochaete densities of constructed marshes were similar to natural marshes. In constructed marshes, densities of surface-deposit feeders, dominated by Streblospio and Manayunkia, achieved equivalence to natural marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Subsurface-deposit feeders, consisting mostly of oligochaetes, did not become equivalent to natural marshes for 25 yr. Predictable trajectories, described by an asymptotic increase over time, existed for total species, species richness, and surface- and subsurface-deposit feeders. Oligochaetes and Manayunkia, which produce non-dispersing larvae, exhibited linear trajectories over time. In constructed marshes, total density and density of dominant taxa and trophic groups were strongly correlated with soil characteristics, especially organic C, N, bulk density and macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat). Non-linear regressions using soil organic C and MOM explained 38 to 40% of the variation in constructed marsh infauna density. The regressions suggest that a threshold of 0.5% soil organic C (500 g m(-2), 0 to 10 cm) and 500 g MOM m(-2) (0 to 10 cm) is needed to support infauna densities comparable to densities found in natural marshes. Taxon richness of constructed marshes was more strongly related to vegetation characteristics, especially macro-organic matter quality (e.g. lignin) than soil characteristics.

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)).

Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands is known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four cores - two collected from marine influenced saltmarshes (WAP-M and POR-M) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (WAP-F and POR-F) - highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. 13C NMR analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C, however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site.

This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)).

The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.",10.1111/gcb.13158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959542967&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13158&partnerID=40&md5=ae6ac69953785c11337ea555ade94708,Kelleway_2016_90074929,"Kelleway, Jeffrey J.; Saintilan, Neil; Macreadie, Peter I.; Skilbeck, Charles G.; Zawadzki, Atun; Ralph, Peter J."

During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period. The result suggests that the C accumulation and surface elevation gains made as a result of mangrove colonization may not be observable over initial decades, but will be significant in the longer term as forests reach maturity.",10.1098/rsbl.2018.0471,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062609363&doi=10.1098%2frsbl.2018.0471&partnerID=40&md5=02c3507bd88613c1e00b4a85eb555d87,Rogers_2019_90075466,"Rogers, Kerrylee; Saintilan, Neil; Mazumder, Debashish; Kelleway, Jeffrey J."

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.",10.1038/s41586-019-0951-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062585818&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-019-0951-7&partnerID=40&md5=4b44efb7fab903f4cd8991016a2c167d,Rogers_2019_90075480,"Rogers, Kerrylee; Kelleway, Jeffrey J.; Saintilan, Neil; Megonigal, J.

Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f,Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927,"Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1).

A radon (Rn-222) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 +/- 3.6 to 15.6 +/- 8.1 cm d(-1). Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity.

Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset < 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) catchment d(-1)) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial.

Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103 +/- 61 Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30 +/- 30 Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32 +/- 1 Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197 Mg/ha (RMSE = 24 Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (similar to 3 mol/m(2)/y) is equal to similar to 24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.",10.1029/2020GB006785,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104318228&doi=10.1029%2f2020GB006785&partnerID=40&md5=a63b98d97469bf195c775eca4ade5643,Reithmaier_2021_90074962,"Reithmaier, Gloria M.

Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f,Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927,"Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby.

However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125378,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089093548&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhydrol.2020.125378&partnerID=40&md5=e352c5c75411052cf4b385c4843ec9aa,Li_2020_90074332,"Li, Xiaofei; Sardans, Jordi; Hou, Lijun; Liu, Min; Xu, Chaobin; Penuelas, Josep"

However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity. Also, rhizospheres exerted a major control on increasing MBC and MBP but rarely affected bacterial community composition or diversity.",10.1007/s10021-019-00468-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075990620&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-019-00468-5&partnerID=40&md5=5a74a2c7b32baeb3c4fae87fbcbe725d,Hu_2020_90074767,"Hu, Minjie; Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi; Yang, Xianyu; Tong, Chuan; Zou, Shuangquan; Cao, Wenzhi"

In both marshes, the denitrification rates varied significantly with the season only in loam soil. The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.HighlightsDenitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.",10.1111/ejss.12956,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083381567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12956&partnerID=40&md5=1111fdd770769b6d9af5ca6ed5172cd6,Hu_2021_90075266,"Hu, Minjie; Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi; Huang, Jiafang; Xu, Kang; Tong, Chuan"

We have investigated the relationships between stocks of different soil organic carbon (SOC) along the soil vertical profile and invasive plant success in a China wetland. In stands dominated by the exotic invasive species Spartina alterniflora and the native invasive Phragmites australis soil organic-carbon concentrations (SOC) were higher (12% and 9%, respectively) than in plots of a native species, Cyperus malaccensis, whereas SOC content (g m(-2) ) was 18% and 17% lower under P. australis than under S. alterniffolia and C. malaccensis, respectively. Soils under both invasive species had the concentrations and contents of light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC), light-fraction organic nitrogen (LFON) at 30-60 cm of soil depth and labile organic carbon (LOC) concentrations at 0-10 cm higher than soils under native species. The invasive species had higher total aboveground, total biomasses and lower shoot:root ratios than the native species. The success of both invasive species was associated with higher growth rates and accumulation of nutrients in biomass than in the native species and also accumulation of C in plant soil system. The stands currently dominated by the invasive species were recently occupied by monospecific stands of the native C. malaccensis, strongly suggesting that all or most of the current soil differences were due to the invasions. Higher sand fraction in C. malaccensis community and higher clay fraction in P. australis community relative to the native species, were correlated with higher soil N and P concentrations in invaded stands. The results suggest that different vegetation cover with distinct shoot/root ratio can change soil structure by favoring sedimentation of different particle size classes. Thus, despite both invasive species have some common traits, the results also showed that different invasive species with partially distinct impacts on soil and nutrient uses can succeed under the same conditions. The traits conferring invasive success are thus not necessarily species-specific. A clear change in the general accumulation of C, N and P in the plant-soil system was related to the invasive plant success in this wetland areas.",10.3390/soils2010005,NA,Wang_2018_90075398,"Wang, Weiqi; Sardans, Jordi; Wang, Chun; Asensio, Dolores; Bartrons, Mireia; Penuelas, Josep"

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.",10.1002/ecs2.2556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010,Mueller_2019_90074609,"Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"

Organic analysis utilized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) for PAHs, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) for pesticides and PCBs. Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks. The spatial distribution of organic contaminants was evaluated in four of these tidal creek-salt marsh systems representing urban/industrial, suburban, and forested watersheds, from, the creek channel. to the adjacent uplands. The distribution of organic contaminants within each representative creek was not concordant with the total organic carbon or the clay content of the sediment. The representative industrial/urban creek-marsh system, Diesel Creek, had the highest concentration of PAHs in the creek channel and the highest concentration of PCBs and DDT on the marsh surface, primarily in the upper portion of the system, The representative suburban creek-marsh system, Shem Creek, had elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs throughout the entire system. This system also had one site with a total PAH concentration of 324,000 ppb and a total DDT concentration that was 20-100 times higher than the other sites. One of the representative forested creek-marsh systems, Rathall Creek, had low levels of the three organic contaminants except for one sampling site that had PAH concentrations a factor of 10 higher than the other sites. The other representative forested creek-marsh system, Long Creek, bad low levels of PAHs and PCBs, but elevated levels of DDT were observed, particularly in the upper portion on the marsh surface. The results of this study suggest that (1) anthropogenic alteration of the land cover in the watersheds of tidal creek-salt marsh systems may increase the organic contaminant loadings in the sediment, and (2) tidal creek-salt marsh sediments, particularly in the creek channel, are repositories and potentially conduits of organic contaminants from the upland environment to the deeper estuarine areas.",10.1007/s002449900540,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032704089&doi=10.1007%2fs002449900540&partnerID=40&md5=8bdae7112737384c311e397322b241df,Sanger_1999_90075158,"Sanger, D.M.; Holland, A.F.; Scott, G.I."

The particle size and total organic carbon (TOC) content of creek sediments in developed watersheds (i.e., industrial, urban, and suburban) were similar to that in watersheds with little or no development (i.e., forested or reference). Those trace metals commonly associated with urban and industrial sources, including Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg, were in significantly higher concentrations in tidal creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds compared to the suburban and forested watersheds. Sediment trace metal concentrations were similar for creeks located in suburban and forested watersheds and 2 to 10 times lower than the creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds. Concentrations of trace metals primarily associated with the natural weathering of basement rock, including Al, Fe, As, Ni, and Mn, were not significantly different among watershed types. Four of the tidal creek-salt marsh systems were extensively sampled from the creek channel to the marsh-upland interface to characterize sediment trace metal spatial distributions within creek-marsh systems. Sediment particle size, TOC, and trace metal concentrations varied spatially within each creek-marsh system depending on the type of development in the watershed and the probable source of metals.

The vegetative component of artificially established salt marshes has been examined in several studies, but relatively little is known about the other aspects of these systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the infaunal community of artificially established salt marshes. Infauna were sampled from pairs of artificially established (AE) salt marshes and nearby natural marshes at six sites along the North Carolina coast. The AE marshes ranged in age from 1 yr to 17 yr. Total infaunal density, density of dominant taxa, and community trophic structure (proportions of subsurface-deposit feeders, surface-deposit and suspension feeders, and carnivores) were compared between the two types of marsh to assess infaunal community development in AE marshes. Overall, the two marsh types had similar component organisms and proportions of trophic groups, but total density and densities within trophic groupings were lower in the AE marshes. Soil organic matter content of the natural marshes was nearly twice that of the AE marshes, and is a possible cause for the higher infaunal densities observed in the natural marshes. Using the same three criteria, comparisons of the natural and AE marshes at each of the six locations revealed varying degrees of similarity. Similarity of each AE marsh to its natural marsh control appeared to be influenced by differences in environmental factors between locations more than by AE marsh age. Functional infaunal habitat convergence of an AE marsh with a natural marsh somewhere within its biogeographical region is probable, but success in duplicating the infaunal community of a particular natural marsh is contingent upon the developmental age of the natural marsh and the presence and interaction of site-specific factors.",10.2307/1352678,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028161373&doi=10.2307%2f1352678&partnerID=40&md5=be42d396981d3b7418b53aec6fa336ee,Sacco_1994_90075452,"Sacco, J.N.; Seneca, E.D.; Wentworth, T.R."

Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively. The abundance of both methanogens and SRB in the sediment of the P. australis marsh with the highest sediment organic carbon content was higher than in the C. malaccensis and S. alterniflora marshes. Mean pore water DMS concentrations over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile under the S. alterniflora marsh were higher than those in the C. malaccensis marsh and P. australis marsh. Methane production rate correlated weakly with the abundance of methanogens across the three marsh zones together, but did not correlate with the concentrations of pore water acetate and DMS.

Halophyte plant communities influence the soil micro-ecosystem in the wetland by exerting effects on the physicochemical properties of the soil, and on enzymes andmicrobial community. In the soil these enzymes affect the redox potential (catalase) and cycling of carbon (dehydrogenase), nitrogen (protease, urease), and phosphorus (acid phosphatase). We analyzed enzyme activity and the relations between the activity of different enzymes, the physicochemical properties of the soil, and the microbial composition. The activity of five enzymes differed significantly between the plant communities. Soil salinity and microbial community composition all influenced enzyme activity. Catalase, protease and urease activity in the soil of the T. chinensis community was significantly higher than in the other two plant communities. Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity were significantly higher in the soil of the P. australis community than in the other two communities.

The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk indexes revealed higher metal contamination in S. alterniflora sediment.

The Eddy-covariance method (indirect method) was used to estimate marsh canopy net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and measured an annual gross primary production of 979 g C m(-2), while the loss through respiration was 766g Cm-2, resulting in a net uptake of 213 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Time of the day, solar irradiation, air temperature, humidity and wind direction all together explained 66% of the variation in NEE. The high marsh community of Spartina patens showed NEE to be significantly higher than the low marsh community. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over long time scales was estimated by measuring the actual amount of total organic carbon contained in dated sediment cores from a natural marsh (direct method), which resulted in a carbon accumulation rate of 192.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Changes in total organic carbon content over time in the core sample showed that 78% of organic carbon remained stored in the sediments after 130 years and only the most recalcitrant carbon (50%) remained under storage beyond 645 years. Overall the study showed that temperate macrotidal salt marshes are net sinks of carbon with potential for long term carbon storage. The marsh turned into a carbon sink at the beginning of May and switched back to being a source in late November. The average sedimentation rate estimated from the 137 CS dating (1950s to present) was 1.4 mm yr(-1) which is similar to accretion rates of comparable S. patens patches in the east coast.

Surface and pore waters were sampled four times a year between 2008 and 2010 and sediment cores were collected yearly in the constructed marsh and once in 2010 in the natural marsh. Interactions of trace metals with redox active species such as iron and sulfide as well as with organic matter were investigated. Precipitation with sulfides played a major role in immobilizing certain trace metals, including Cr, Mn, and Pb. At both sites, the presence of sulfide did not preclude the presence of dissolved trace metals in pore-water at concentrations exceeding their metal sulfide solubility product. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling indicated these dissolved metals remained in solution due to an association with heterogeneous dissolved organic carbon. No net trace metal accumulation in the surficial sediments of the constructed marsh was noted between 2007 and 2010. This implied that a dynamic equilibrium of trace metal flux into and out of the sediments was established, rather than a long-term net accumulation of trace metals. In the constructed marsh, little difference was found between the immobilization potential in the area of intermittent flooding (high marsh) and the area of sustained flooding (low marsh). The newly constructed wetland immobilized significantly more Cr, Mn, and Zn than the natural marsh and similar concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Pb.

These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized. Our findings point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column.",10.1029/2017JG004211,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059280963&doi=10.1029%2f2017JG004211&partnerID=40&md5=7151041e0a484e2ac9361b2d4fd3d1c1,Lalimi_2018_90074422,"Lalimi, F.

Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.",10.1111/rec.13439,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109387688&doi=10.1111%2frec.13439&partnerID=40&md5=da2889eae978aa7bf1b3dfc16b9a0048,Ledford_2021_90075160,"Ledford, Taylor C.; Mortazavi, Behzad; Tatariw, Corianne; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Wood, Abigail Griffin; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.",10.1111/rec.13300,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096713864&doi=10.1111%2frec.13300&partnerID=40&md5=c3a2a63e5c65058eade1222f6e46628e,Tatariw_2021_90075351,"Tatariw, Corianne; Mortazavi, Behzad; Ledford, Taylor C.; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Griffin Wood, Abigail; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

JOUR,90074920,2020,NA," Siok, Drexel",author_05,Assessing coastal carbon variability in two Delaware tidal marshes,"Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the ability to sequester and store carbon. Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance's National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this 'blue carbon' storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000.

Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02582.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857137924&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2486.2011.02582.x&partnerID=40&md5=cfd1e9fdd645bf9256f6b61fc8bb3138,Macreadie_2012_90074734,"Macreadie, Peter I.; Allen, Katie; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Ralph, Peter J.; Skilbeck, Charles G."

The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone.

We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context.

It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity.

Green beach vegetation can develop on nutrient-poor beaches landward from embryo dunes. It is characterised by low-dynamic coastal wetland habitat such as salt marshes and dune slacks. It has been hypothesised that the establishment of green beach vegetation is facilitated by the shelter provided by embryo dunes, however evidence is lacking.We explored the importance of geomorphology and soil conditions on the species richness and turnover of green beach vegetation over a time period of 10 years. We recorded 107 plots along 11 transects over a gradient from beach to dune on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. We characterised transect geomorphology at transect level and soil conditions and vegetation at plot level in 2006 and 2016.We found that the green beach vegetation was highly dynamic, total plant cover increased by 62% within 10 years. In 2006 beach width was an important factor in explaining species richness, with the highest number of species occurring on narrow beaches with a large volume of embryo dunes. In 2016, species richness was positively associated with the build-up of organic matter. Overall species richness declined relative to 2006 and was accompanied by an increase in elevation due to sand burial and the expansion of embryo dune volume.Our data suggests that geomorphology influenced the vegetation indirectly by affecting sand burial rate. Plant species richness declined less at sheltered conditions where sand burial was limited, allowing the build-up of organic matter. This indicates a time-dependent relationship between the development of embryo dunes and plant species richness: embryo dunes can be a source of shelter, thus increasing species richness, but can compete for space over time, lowering species richness again.

The interaction between digestive tract bacteria and soil animal hosts is still poorly explored despite the importance of soil fauna for ecosystem processes. In this study, we investigated the interactions between the bacterial communities from the digestive tract of the litter-feeding, semi-terrestrial crustacean Orchestia gammarellus and those obtained from the environment; these organisms thrive in, i.e., soil and plant litter from salt marshes. We hypothesized that elevation is an important driver of soil and litter bacterial communities, which indirectly (via ingested soil and litter bacteria) influences the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of O. gammarellus. Indeed, our results revealed that elevation modulated soil and litter bacterial community composition along with soil organic matter content and the C:N ratio. Soil and plant litter differed in alpha diversity indexes (richness and diversity), and in the case of plant litter, both indexes increased with elevation. In contrast, elevation did not affect the composition of bacterial communities associated with O. gammarellus' digestive tract, suggesting selection by the host, despite the fact that a large component of the bacterial community was also detected in external sources. Importantly, Ca. Bacilloplasma and Vibrio were highly prevalent and abundant in the host. The taxonomic comparison of Ca. Bacilloplasma amplicon sequence variants across the host at different elevations suggested a phylogenetic divergence due to host habitat (i.e., marine or semi-terrestrial), thus supporting their potential functional role in the animal physiology.

A total of 71,833 specimens representing 38 species were identified from a gradient of different elevation zones across the study area. We identified five live assemblages and nine biofacies for the dead assemblages from estuarine, low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, and upland transition environments. Although dissolution of calcareous tests was observed in the dead assemblages, characteristic species and abundance patterns dependent on elevation in the intertidal zone were similar between living assemblages and dead biofacies. The assemblages from the eastern Mississippi Sound estuaries were dominated by Ammonia tepida, Cribroelphidium poeyanum, C. excavatum, and Paratrochammina simplissima. The low marshes were dominated by Ammotium salsum, Ammobaculites exiguus, and Miliammina fusca. The dominant species in the middle marshes was Arenoparrella mexicana. The most abundant species in the high marshes was Entzia macrescens. The upland-marsh transition zones were dominated by Trochamminita irregularis and Pseudothurammina limnetis. Canonical correspondence analysis was applied to assess the relationship between a priori defined biofacies and measured environmental data (elevation, grain size, organic matter, and salinity) to test the hypothesis that distribution of foraminiferal assemblages is driven by elevation and hence flooding frequency. Salinity was the second most important explanatory variable of dead assemblages. Riverine freshwater from the Pascagoula River markedly influenced the live and dead assemblages in the Pascagoula River marsh, which was represented by low diversity and densities and dominance by Ammoastuta inepta.

Currently, there is a paucity of information on how these changes may alter the carbon accumulation capacity of coastal areas. Here, sediment cores were collected from two areas and used to determine the influence of mangrove migration and deforestation on sediment carbon stocks and accumulation rates. The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1). The total sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) accumulation rates for the period after mangrove deforestation (2005-2011) exhibited significant differences between preserved areas (Core C: 43.9 +/- 6.9 g m(-2) yr(-1); Core D: 83.1 +/- 5.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the deforested area (Core B: 25.8 +/- 6.0 g m(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting a decline after deforestation. For the preserved area, the TOC accumulation under mangrove dominance (65.5 +/- 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), after 1944) was higher than under saltmarsh dominance (23.5 +/- 15.9 g m(-2) yr(-1,) before 1944), as revealed by carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13). The increase in the TOC accumulation due to mangrove expansion in this New Zealand estuary was conservatively estimated as three-fold higher, and two-fold higher in stocks in comparison to the period when this ecosystem was dominated by non-mangrove vegetation.

This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.",10.1007/s12237-017-0362-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039866198&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-017-0362-7&partnerID=40&md5=e99451cc4a55cb3dba759112a13f7ab0,Radabaugh_2018_90075169,"Radabaugh, Kara R.; Moyer, Ryan P.; Chappel, Amanda R.; Powell, Christina E.; Bociu, Ioana; Clark, Barbara C.; Smoak, Joseph M."

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.",10.1111/rec.13439,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109387688&doi=10.1111%2frec.13439&partnerID=40&md5=da2889eae978aa7bf1b3dfc16b9a0048,Ledford_2021_90075160,"Ledford, Taylor C.; Mortazavi, Behzad; Tatariw, Corianne; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Wood, Abigail Griffin; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.",10.1111/rec.13300,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096713864&doi=10.1111%2frec.13300&partnerID=40&md5=c3a2a63e5c65058eade1222f6e46628e,Tatariw_2021_90075351,"Tatariw, Corianne; Mortazavi, Behzad; Ledford, Taylor C.; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Griffin Wood, Abigail; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems.

This study aims to identify the key biogeochemical drivers of metal mobilisation on contaminated estuarine sediments through 91) evaluation of the potential mobilisation under controlled conditions, and 92) investigation of the relevance of metal mobilisation for in situ pollution levels in an area with multiple contaminant sources. Sediments from a saltmarsh adjacent to a coastal landfill, a marina, and a shipyard on the Thames Estuary (Essex, UK) were exposed in the laboratory 924 h, N = 96, 20 degrees C) to water under various salinity, pH, and redox potential. Major cations, Fe(II), and trace metal concentrations were analysed in the leachate and sediment. Salinity, pH and redox had a significant effect on metal mobilisation (p < 0.001), e.g. under certain conditions Fe(II) leaching was increased similar to 1000-fold. Measurements in situ of surface and subsurface sediment cores revealed that landfill proximity poorly explained metal spatial distribution. However, physicochemical parameters explained up to 97% of geochemically normalized metal concentrations in sediments. Organic matter and pH were dominant factors for most of the metal concentrations at the sediment surface. At subsurface, major cations (Ca, Na, Mg and K) were determinant predictors of metal concentrations. Applying the empirical model obtained in the laboratory to geochemical conditions of the studied saltmarsh it was possible to demonstrate that Fe mobilisation regulates the fate of this (and other) metal in that area. Thus, present results highlight the importance of metal mobility to control sediment pollution and estuarine fate of metals. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.Key Points.Salt marsh soils preserved compounds with a range of reactivities that were derived from local grasses9%-17% of surface soil carbon was old, likely reflecting redeposition of eroded creekbank materialDecomposition decreases soil organic carbon thermal reactivity, and disturbances accelerate this shift, particularly in surface horizons",10.1029/2020GL090287,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099777956&doi=10.1029%2f2020GL090287&partnerID=40&md5=718ae426665bb4b6e02a6420ba5a8348,Luk_2021_90074440,"Luk, Sheron Y.; Todd-Brown, Katherine; Eagle, Meagan; McNichol, Ann P.; Sanderman, Jonathan; Gosselin, Kelsey; Spivak, Amanda C."

We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation.

Coastal Louisiana marshes have been historically classified as fresh, intermediate, brackish, or saline based on resident plant community and position along a salinity gradient. Short-term total carbon accumulation rates were assessed by collecting 10-cm deep soil cores at 24 sites located in marshes spanning the salinity gradient. Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates. Based on both analyses, the coastal Louisiana total marsh area (1,433,700 ha) accumulates about 2.7 to 3.3 Tg C year(-1).

Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.",10.1029/2018GB005897,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047623402&doi=10.1029%2f2018GB005897&partnerID=40&md5=e45660cdfbade7aea8c8ed4eaf9f93a9,Krauss_2018_90075283,"Krauss, Ken W.; Noe, Gregory B.; Duberstein, Jamie A.; Conner, William H.; Stagg, Camille L.; Cormier, Nicole; Jones, Miriam C.; Bernhardt, Christopher E.; Lockaby, B.

Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.",10.1111/rec.13439,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109387688&doi=10.1111%2frec.13439&partnerID=40&md5=da2889eae978aa7bf1b3dfc16b9a0048,Ledford_2021_90075160,"Ledford, Taylor C.; Mortazavi, Behzad; Tatariw, Corianne; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Wood, Abigail Griffin; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.",10.1111/rec.13300,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096713864&doi=10.1111%2frec.13300&partnerID=40&md5=c3a2a63e5c65058eade1222f6e46628e,Tatariw_2021_90075351,"Tatariw, Corianne; Mortazavi, Behzad; Ledford, Taylor C.; Starr, Sommer F.; Smyth, Erin; Griffin Wood, Abigail; Simpson, Lorae T.; Cherry, Julia A."

We used piezometer networks to evaluate the in situ groundwater denitrification capacity and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux (with N-15-enriched nitrate-N via the push-pull method) in four former fringing salt marshes topped by HTM along the Rhode Island coast, U.S.A. Groundwater at these sites commonly interacted with the buried marsh horizon and the HTM. In situ groundwater denitrification capacity site means ranged from 15.2 to 71.7 mu g N kg(-1)d(-1) with no significant differences between sites due to high intrasite variability. The site with the highest and most consistent denitrification capacity also had HTM of the finest texture and highest soluble organic carbon.

The site with the highest N2O contributions also had the lowest ambient groundwater nitrate-N indicating lack of priming for N2O reduction to N-2. Former salt marshes with HTM deposits may still have the capacity for substantial groundwater denitrification capacity, similar to that observed in undisturbed salt marshes, but may also contribute substantially to global N2O emissions.

Results showed that the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora altered the stocks and distribution of inorganic sulfur form in marsh soils.

JOUR,90074439,2006,NA," Sun, Shucun",author_05,"The flux of methyl chloride along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh, Eastern China","Salt marshes have been suggested to be a large potential source for methyl chloride (CH3Cl) that is the major natural carrier of chlorine to the stratosphere. However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

JOUR,90075324,2006,NA," Sun, Shucun",author_05,Removal of methyl chloroform in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China,"The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH3CCl3 emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Over all sampling periods, CH4 fluxes averaged between -0.392 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and 0.495 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), and emissions occurred during spring (0.008 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.068 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed during summer (-0.110 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (-0.009 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). CH4 fluxes from the four marshes were not significantly different (p > 0.05), and emissions occurred in LSM (0.026 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and BF (0.055 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed in HSM (-0.035 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and MSM (-0.022 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average CH4 flux from the intertidal zone was 0.002 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), indicating that coastal marsh acted as a weak CH4 source. Temporal variations of CH4 emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (temperatures, soil moisture and salinity) and the variations of limited C and mineral N in sediments, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.This study observed a large spatial variation of CH4 fluxes across the coastal marsh of the Yellow River estuary (CV = 7856.25 %), suggesting that the need to increase the spatial replicates at fine scales before the regional CH4 budget was evaluated precisely. With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.",10.1007/s11104-012-1564-1,NA,Sun_2013_90074736,"Sun, Zhigao; Jiang, Huanhuan; Wang, Lingling; Mou, Xiaojie; Sun, Wanlong"

Here, we examined the decay of shichito matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of litter decomposition, but could change the dominant pathway.",10.1007/s12237-019-00565-7,NA,Hu_2019_90074533,"Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Linhai; Lai, Derrick Y.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.",10.3390/ijerph16112043,NA,Hu_2019_90075112,"Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng"

Results showed that the decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79% faster than that of S. alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the C/N and lignin. Compared with S. alterniflora, the N (nitrogen) and S (sulfur) concentrations of litter in C. malaccensis were significantly higher. The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage.

Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh.

JOUR,90075116,2017,NA," Sylva, Sean P.",author_07,Shallow ponds are heterogeneous habitats within a temperate salt marsh ecosystem,"Integrating spatial heterogeneity into assessments of salt marsh biogeochemistry is becoming increasingly important because disturbances that reduce plant productivity and soil drainage may contribute to an expansion of shallow ponds. These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited.

Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.",10.1002/lno.10797,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051104990&doi=10.1002%2flno.10797&partnerID=40&md5=f467cdaa62630a06312a579ca8f317fa,Spivak_2018_90075496,"Spivak, Amanda C.; Gosselin, Kelsey M.; Sylva, Sean P."

Several sources of variation can lead to spatial differences in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species including: biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg production and availability within an organism's home range; trophic positions of consumers and MeHg biomagnification efficiency in food webs; and individual prey preferences that influence diet composition. To better understand spatial variation in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species, we evaluated the effects of habitat biogeochemistry, food web structure, and diet composition in the wetland-obligate California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) at three wetlands along the Petaluma River in northern San Francisco Bay, California, USA. The concentration of MeHg in sediments differed significantly among wetlands. We identified three sediment and porewater measurements that contributed significantly to a discriminant function explaining differences in habitat biogeochemistry among wetlands: the porewater concentration of ferrous iron, the percent organic matter, and the sediment MeHg concentration. Food web structure and biomagnification efficiency were similar among wetlands, with trophic magnification factors for MeHg ranging from 1.84 to 2.59. In addition, regurgitation samples indicated that black rails were dietary generalists with similar diets among wetlands (percent similarity indices > 70%). Given the similarities in diet composition, food web structure, and MeHg biomagnification efficiency among wetlands, we concluded that variation in habitat biogeochemistry and associated sediment MeHg production was the primary driver of differences in MeHg concentrations among black rails from different wetlands.

JOUR,90074906,2014,NA," Takekawa, John Y.",author_05,Importance of Biogeomorphic and Spatial Properties in Assessing a Tidal Salt Marsh Vulnerability to Sea-level Rise,"We evaluated the biogeomorphic processes of a large (309 ha) tidal salt marsh and examined factors that influence its ability to keep pace with relative sea-level rise (SLR). Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37 % (113 ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63 % (196 ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55 % (169 ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (< 5.5 %), with mean bulk densities of 0.58 g cm(-3), indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.",10.1007/s12237-013-9725-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901984314&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-013-9725-x&partnerID=40&md5=0c21b313f67f05787c4a232e7247e17d,Thorne_2014_90074906,"Thorne, Karen M.; Elliott-Fisk, Deborah L.; Wylie, Glenn D.; Perry, William M.; Takekawa, John Y."

We conducted experiments across a latitudinal and climate gradient of tidal marshes in the northeast Pacific to evaluate the effects of climate- and vegetation-related factors on litter decomposition. We manipulated tidal exposure and litter type in experimental mesocosms at two sites and used variation across marsh landscapes at seven sites to test for relationships between decomposition and marsh elevation, soil temperature, vegetation composition, litter quality, and sediment organic content. A greater than tenfold increase in manipulated tidal inundation resulted in small increases in decomposition of roots and rhizomes of two species, but no significant change in decay rates of shoots of three other species. In contrast, across the latitudinal gradient, decomposition rates of Salicornia pacifica litter were greater in high marsh than in low marsh. Rates were not correlated with sediment temperature or organic content, but were associated with plant assemblage structure including above-ground cover, species composition, and species richness. Decomposition rates also varied by litter type; at two sites in the Pacific Northwest, the grasses Deschampsia cespitosa and Distichlis spicata decomposed more slowly than the forb S. pacifica. Our data suggest that elevation gradients and vegetation structure in tidal marshes both affect rates of litter decay, potentially leading to complex spatial patterns in sediment carbon dynamics.

Macrofaunal densities in Pacific S. foliosa marshes (avg. 122,268 indiv. m(-2) > 300 mu m) were 3 to 10 times higher than observed in Atlantic S. alterniflora and S. anglica marshes. The macrofauna of S. foliosa marshes was composed mainly of enchytraeid, naidid, and tubificid oligochaetes (66%), with the enchytraeids dominant at all sites except Bolsa Chica Lagoon. Polychaetes, insects, and peracarid crustaceans accounted for most of the remaining fauna. Multivariate analyses indicated greatest faunal similarity between the two southernmost marshes (Mission Bay and San Diego Bay), and between Anaheim and Newport Bay marshes, with Bolsa Chica Lagoon exhibiting a distinct assemblage. There were strong positive associations of faunal abundance and composition with percent organic matter and percent open area, and negative associations with percent sand and dry weight of algae. For the vegetated marsh in Mission Bay, faunal comparisons were made with an adjacent mudflat and with a S. alterniflora marsh in North Carolina, USA. The unvegetated mudflat exhibited similar macrofaunal densities but higher species richness than the adjacent Spartina marsh. The macrofaunal assemblage of the Mission Bay S. foliosa marsh differed from that of the Atlantic S. alterniflora marsh and the Pacific mudflat in having a greater proportion of oligochaetes, especially Enchytraeidae, and fewer polychaetes. This study represents the first published description that we are aware of for macrofauna in S. foliosa vegetated marsh sediments. The findings document faunal variation among southern California embayments and suggest that differences in macrobenthic community structure occur between marsh and mudflat habitat as web as between east and west coast Spartina marshes.

This study used observations of natural variation and large-scale manipulative experiments to test the influence of vascular vegetation and soil organic matter on the rate and trajectory of macrofaunal recovery in a southern California created salt marsh, the Crown Point Mitigation Site. During the first three years following marsh establishment, macrofaunal density and species richness recovered rapidly within the Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) zone; densities in the created marsh were 50% of those in the natural marsh after 16 mo and 97% after 28 mo. However, the early successional assemblage had a lower proportion of tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes, and a higher proportion of chironomids and other insect larvae than did the mature natural marsh. Most of the colonizers arrived by rafting on sea grass and algae rather than by larval dispersal. Initial planting of S. foliosa had no influence on macrofaunal recovery, perhaps because of variable transplant survival. However, subsequently, both positive and negative correlations were observed between densities of some macrofaunal taxa and shoot densities of S. foliosa or Salicornia spp. (pickleweed). Salinity and measures of soil organics (belowground biomass, combustible organic matter, and chlorophyll a) also were correlated with macrofaunal densities and taxon richness. Of foul added soil amendments (kelp, alfalfa, peat, and Milorganite), Milorganite (a sewage product) and kelp both promoted macrofaunal colonization during year 1, but effects were short lived. The most significant sources of heterogeneity in the recovering marsh were associated with site history and climate variation. Faunal recovery was most rapid in highly localized, organic-rich marsh sediments that were remnants of the historical wetland. Elevated sea level during the 1998 El Nino corresponded with similarity of macrofaunal communities in the created and natural marshes. The large spatial scale and multi-year duration of this study revealed that natural sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may exert stronger influence on faunal succession in California wetlands than manipulation of vegetation or soil properties.",10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1785:NAMSOH]2.0.CO;2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036994925&doi=10.1890%2f1051-0761%282002%29012%5b1785%3aNAMSOH%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=ee758fde8083ed2e382cd95b660bfd1e,Levin_2002_90074473,"Levin, L.A.; Talley, T.S."

The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis. The succession of macrofaunal communities should be considered as a comprehensive response to the variations on environmental properties co-varying with smooth cordgrass invasion in coastal wetlands.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104862,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076841752&doi=10.1016%2fj.marenvres.2019.104862&partnerID=40&md5=b68bd776d73c044d9ca74bcd2e67c4d1,Ge_2020_90074349,"Ge, Baoming; Jiang, Senhao; Yang, Li; Zhang, Huabin; Tang, Boping"

Invasion of S. alterniflora altered the environmental properties. With the increase of invasion age, the coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content tended to increase, whereas chlorophyll a and salinity tended to decrease. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the habitats were separated along the gradient of the invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and salinity were the most important characters for habitat differentiation because the PCA biplot illustrated that the vectors of these environmental properties involved the smaller angles with PC 1. Based on a two-way ANOVA analysis, invasion stage of S. alterniflora and season significantly affected the density of A. latericea (p < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (p = 0. 226). The density of A. latericea varied significantly among seasons in each habitat based on a one-way ANOVA analysis, except in the bare mudflat without invasion. The highest densities occurred at the mature invasion stage in autumn, whereas the lowest densities occurred with no invasion in spring. Both Taylor's and Iwao's regressions indicated that A. latericea presented an aggregated distribution pattern (p < 0.001). The consistent distribution pattern indicated that it might be a biological trait of the species. Based on stepwise regression analysis, stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content were selected for the optimal regression model. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion altered the environment of the coast and variation in A. latericea density was a response of the species to the environmental change caused by S. alterniflora invasion.

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions.

However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the loss of marsh vegetation because of human-driven disturbances such as sea level rise and oil spills can potentially reduce marsh capacity for N removal. To investigate the effect of vegetation loss on ecosystem N removal, we contrasted denitrification capacity in marsh and subtidal sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using a combination of N-29(2) and N-30(2) production (isotope pairing), denitrification potential measurements (acetylene block), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of functional genes in the denitrification pathway. We found that, on average, denitrification capacity was 4 times higher in vegetated sediments because of a combination of enhanced nitrification and higher organic carbon availability. The abundance of nirS-type denitrifers indicated that marsh vegetation regulates the activity, rather than the abundance, of denitrifier communities. We estimated that marsh sediments remove an average of 3.6 t N km(-2) y(-1) compared to 0.9 t N km(-2) y(-1) in unvegetated sediments.

This study explored the ability of using testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) from sediments of a freshwater tidal marsh as indicators of water level in an inland estuary. The hypothesis was that modern testate amoeba assemblages change with surface elevation (approximately the duration of tidal flooding) within a freshwater tidal marsh. Variation in testate amoeba assemblages in relation to multiple environmental variables and sediment characteristics was studied through redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that a significant part of the variation in modern testate amoeba assemblages could be explained by flooding frequency, surface elevation, organic content and particle size of the soil. Transfer functions, partial least squares and weighted average regressions were made to show that testate amoebae can be used for reconstruction of water level (with an accuracy of 0.05 Normalized Elevation).

As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.",10.5194/bg-13-6611-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006355608&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6611-2016&partnerID=40&md5=7655f8f0776015827d9fb54deb45e299,Van de Broek_2016_90074835,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Temmerman, Stijn; Merckx, Roel; Govers, Gerard"

The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream.

Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.",10.1111/gcb.14089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042585405&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14089&partnerID=40&md5=ca6b3949132cd145c5ff964e9c7784b3,Van de Broek_2018_90075086,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Vandendriessche, Caroline; Poppelmonde, Dries; Merckx, Roel; Temmerman, Stijn; Govers, Gerard"

This study investigates the possibility of using soil testate amoebae assemblages of a brackish tidal marsh (Scheldt estuary, Belgium) as a proxy for water level changes. On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone's testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (similar to elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh. Testate amoeba assemblages in such a brackish habitat show thus a vertical zonation (RMSEP: 0.19 m) that is comparable to the vertical zonation of testate amoebae and other protists on freshwater tidal marshes and salt marshes.",10.4467/16890027AP.12.022.0768,NA,Ooms_2012_90075219,"Ooms, Marijke; Beyens, Louis; Temmerman, Stijn"

However, there is growing evidence that restored tidal marshes and their services develop slowly and differ from natural tidal marshes in many aspects. Here we focus on groundwater dynamics, because these affect several key ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and vegetation development. We hypothesize that groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are reduced as compared to natural marshes because of the difference in soil structure. In the macro-tidal Schelde estuary (Belgium), in both a natural and a restored (since 2006) freshwater tidal marsh, we measured depth profiles of soil properties (grain size distribution, LOI (loss on ignition), moisture content and bulk density) and temporal dynamics of groundwater levels along a transect with increasing distance from a tidal creek. X-ray micro CT-scanning was used to quantify soil macroporosity. The restored marsh has a two layered soil stratigraphy with a topsoil of freshly accreted sediment (ranging in depth between 10 and 60 cm, deposited since 2006) and a subsoil of compact relict agricultural soil. We found that both the soil in the natural marsh and the topsoil of the restored marsh consist of loosely packed sediment rich in macropores and organic matter, whereas the relict agricultural soil in the restored marsh is densely packed and has few macropores. Our results show that groundwater level fluctuations in the restored marsh are restricted to the top layer of newly deposited sediment (i.e. on average 0.08 m depth). Groundwater level fluctuations in the natural marsh occur over a larger depth of the soil profile (i.e. on average 0.28 m depth). As a consequence, the reduced groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are expected to alter the subsurface fluxes of water and nutrients, the source sink function and the development of marsh vegetation.",10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082525252&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2019.02.006&partnerID=40&md5=95bab27bd92463f39fb544ea94aab87b,Van Putte_2020_90075309,"Van Putte, Niels; Temmerman, Stijn; Verreydt, Goedele; Seuntjens, Piet; Maris, Tom; Heyndrickx, Marjolein; Boone, Matthieu; Joris, Ingeborg; Meire, Patrick"

However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.",10.3354/meps11447,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944345360&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11447&partnerID=40&md5=1a65ee2c699aa61d133ef331b5041bec,Elschot_2015_90075467,"Elschot, Kelly; Bakker, Jan P.; Temmerman, Stijn; van de Koppel, Johan; Bouma, Tjeerd J."

The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.",10.1007/s11368-018-2177-y,NA,Sun_2019_90074631,"Sun, Zhigao; Li, Jiabing; He, Tao; Tian, Liping; Li, Jing; Li, Xiao"

Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles. Heavy metal levels in sediments of the Min River estuary were much higher compared with most estuaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern. Both Ni and Pb in sediments of the intertidal zone showed high potential toxicity and high contributions to the sum of the toxic units (Sigma TUs).

Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference.

The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge.

However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats.

NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha-1), to mangrove (46 t ha-1), to seagrass (27 t ha-1) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha-1). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta13C and delta15N mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries.

In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries.

Within a salt marsh area along the Canche Estuary (northern France), four transects were sampled to see the effects of maximal tidal constraints (shore transects) and minimal tidal constraints (alongshore transects). Multivariate analyses have been performed to determine the correlations between biotic (foraminiferal absolute abundances) and abiotic factors (elevation, grain-size, TOC and total sulphur). For each of the principal benthic foraminiferal species the tolerance to subaerial exposure have been estimated as well. Two distinctive foraminiferal zones have been identified along the vertical tidal gradient: a zone I in the higher part of the salt marsh dominated by agglutinated and porcelaneous taxa, and a zone II in the lower one dominated by hyaline specimens. Hyper tidal exposure constraints the foraminiferal vertical zonation in accordance with the tidal frame. However it does not constitute a threshold parameter able by itself to explain all the faunal variations in the Canche Estuary. For sea level indicators, foraminifera should be considered relative to tidal subaerial exposure rather than to absolute altitude. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One-centimeter increments of Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated sediment were analyzed for diatoms, pigments (phaeophytin and chlorophyll a), biogenic silica, percentage organic matter, percentage carbon, and percentage nitrogen. Both sediment chlorophyll a and a diatom-based trophic index (TI) were significantly and positively correlated with riverine or local nutrient indices. Two diatom species, Amphora copulata Giffen and Navicula yarrensis Grunow, were significantly and negatively correlated with riverine and local nutrient indices. These results suggest that these variables can be used as potential indicators of trophic status. Results from a complete-linkage cluster analysis on the diatom assemblage data demonstrated that the sediment cores could be split into three time periods: early 1900s (pre-1930s/1940s), mid-1900s (1930s/40s to 1960s/1970s), and late 1900s (1960snos to 1990s). Examination of the sediment chlorophyll a and TI data over these time periods, coupled with an analysis of variance of nutrient inputs between the time periods, suggests that nutrient loading increased dramatically from the mid1960s to the mid-1970s. This study demonstrates that (1) a retrospective analysis of sediment cores can be conducted in highly variable salt marsh ponds and (2) these salt marsh environments are already affected by the higher nutrient loads from both riverine and local processes occurring over the last 50 years.

At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.",10.1128/AEM.00784-17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030695399&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00784-17&partnerID=40&md5=967ec70a42723bb8bcf6dda398a2b8da,Engel_2017_90074751,"Engel, Annette Summers; Liu, Chang; Paterson, Audrey T.; Anderson, Laurie C.; Turner, R.

Such a model should follow classic patterns of soil nutrient pools described for alluvial ecosystems that are dominated by mineral matter high in phosphorus and low in carbon and nitrogen. A contrast with classic models of soil development is the anthropogenically enriched high nitrate conditions due to agricultural fertilization in upstream watersheds. Here we determine if short-term patterns of soil chemistry and dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes along the emerging Wax Lake delta (WLD) chronosequence are consistent with conceptual models of long-term nutrient availability described for other ecosystems. We add a low nitrate treatment more typical of historic delta development to evaluate the role of nitrate enrichment in determining the net dinitrogen (N-2) flux. Throughout the 35-year chronosequence, soil nitrogen and organic matter content significantly increased by an order of magnitude, whereas phosphorus exhibited a less pronounced increase. Under ambient nitrate concentrations (> 60 mu M), mean net N-2 fluxes (157.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) indicated greater rates of gross denitrification than gross nitrogen fixation; however, under low nitrate concentrations (< 2 mu M), soils switched from net denitrification to net nitrogen fixation (-74.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). As soils in the WLD aged, the subsequent increase in organic matter stimulated net N-2, oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite fluxes producing greater fluxes in more mature soils. In conclusion, soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation along an emerging delta chronosequence largely coincide with classic patterns of soil development described for alluvial floodplains, and substrate age together with ambient nitrogen availability can be used to predict net N-2 fluxes during early delta evolution.",10.1007/s10021-013-9727-3,NA,Henry_2014_90074807,"Henry, Kelly M.; Twilley, Robert R."

These expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error [SE]: 0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 %), or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on autochthonous soil development.

JOUR,90074782,2018,NA," Unger, Viktoria",author_02,Geomorphic influences on the contribution of vegetation to soil C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora marshes,"Salt marshes are important hotspots of long-term belowground carbon (C) storage, where plant biomass and allochthonous C can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years. However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.",10.5194/bg-15-379-2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040771479&doi=10.5194%2fbg-15-379-2018&partnerID=40&md5=e1cdb8a9dc523eb908d0a9ab98583c97,Elsey-Quirk_2018_90074782,"Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Unger, Viktoria"

At each salt marsh, samples were taken from a non-vegetated zone and one from each of areas dominated by Halimione portulacoides, Spartina maritima and Arthrocnemum fruticosum. Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher. These results point out that plants are an important feature for metal accumulation in salt marshes.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon.

JOUR,90075296,2015, Europe," Valente, T.",author_08,"Bromine enrichment in marsh sediments as a marker of environmental changes driven by Grand Solar Minima and anthropogenic activity (Caminha, NW of Portugal)","A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

JOUR,90075302,2017, Europe," Valente, T.",author_06,Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries,"This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

Concentration of branched (br) GDGTs ranged from < 1 to 15 mu g/g organic carbon (OC) and crenarchaeol ranged from 0.6 to 19 mu g/g OC. An overall decrease in brGDGTs was observed from the inner Thames (Brentford) to the outer Thames (Isle of Grain), suggesting a drop in soil OM input towards the sea. In contrast, crenarchaeol concentration was highest around east London rather than towards the open sea. Such elevated crenarchaeol concentration occurred in the section of the river most influenced by anthropogenic pollution, such as discharge points for London's major sewage treatment plants, docks and power plants. The non-systematic spatial distribution of crenarchaeol was also reflected in the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The highest BIT values occurred upstream and in close proximity to salt marshes (0.8-1), whereas the lowest values (0.3-0.5) were towards the sea. However, unusually low values (0.4) were observed in the river section that had high crenarchaeol concentration. In contrast, bulk delta C-13 values were insensitive to London's anthropogenic influence. This suggests that the natural systematic decrease in BIT index in the estuary is overprinted by London's anthropogenic activity between Deptford Creek and Tilbury. We therefore advise caution when interpreting the BIT index for sediments in close proximity to megacities discharging industrial and municipal waste that can become incorporated into the near surface sedimentary record.

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time.

Four modern transects collected from three tidal environments at Siletz Bay, Oregon, USA, produced three elevation-dependent groups in both the foraminiferal and delta C-13/bulk geochemistry datasets. Foraminiferal samples from the tidal flat and low marsh are identified by Miliammina fusca abundances of >45%, middle and high marsh by M. fusca abundances of <45% and the highest marsh by Trochamminita irregularis abundances >25%.

Living and dead foraminiferal species from 10 stations were analyzed over two successive years in the summer (dry) and fall (wet) seasons. There were insignificant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the distribution of live and dead species.

Here we present the results of a comprehensive vegetation and sediment delta C-13 and C/N survey of Welwich Marsh (outer Humber Estuary, UK), together with high-resolution delta C-13 and C/N analyses of Holocene cores collected nine years previously from the Humber Estuary and the Lincolnshire Marshes, Eastern England, UK. The contemporary intertidal delta C-13 and C/N dataset shows a gradual increase in surface sediment delta C-13 with decreasing marsh height and suggests that delta C-13 is controlled by the degree of tidal inundation and thus reflects organic matter source. However, sediment C/N ratios are less sensitive to tidal changes and the recent introduction Of C-4 salt-marsh species complicates the contemporary analogue. The Holocene delta C-13 and C/N records are in general agreement with existing microfossil data and provide additional palacoenvironmental information. This includes support for an estuary-wide expansion of marine conditions from c. 3.3 ka cal. yr BP, followed by a contraction of marine conditions after c. 2.7 ka cal. yr BP, and evidence for an increase in delivery of terrigenous organic matter to the inner estuary in the late Holocene. Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis is shown to be a reliable and independent indicator of coastal environmental change and is therefore a complementary technique to the more commonly used microfossil approach. However, this study also shows that in some circumstances the technique may be compromised when applied to sediments from cores that have been stored for a period of time.

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.",10.1007/s10021-021-00660-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108615887&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00660-6&partnerID=40&md5=3c98333d69e7f9089f95a1f2e2d667bb,Martins_2021_90074438,"Martins, Marcio; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Masque, Pere; Carrasco, A.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions.

Diatom samples were collected from 100 sites in Barnegat Bay and Great Bay representing both subtidal and intertidal habitats. A total of 603 diatom taxa were found, with most samples characterized by high species diversity. A strong north-to-south salinity gradient in the study area was a major factor influencing composition of diatom assemblages. Subtidal sediments, especially in highly productive areas in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay, contained a high proportion of planktonic diatoms, especially small-celled Cyclotella and Chaetoceros species. Habitat type and physical properties, such as particle size and depth, were other important factors structuring diatom assemblages. Water-column nutrients and sediment contaminants did not show much effect on sediment diatoms, possibly due to the overriding effect of salinity or low variability in nutrient/ contaminant concentrations. However, the organic matter content of sediments was significantly related to diatom species composition. Both sediment carbon and nitrogen were considerably higher in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay and other areas experiencing strong human impacts. This study developed diatom inference models for salinity and sediment nitrogen content and concluded that diatom species with relatively high optima for sediment nitrogen may be used as indicators of nutrient enrichment in studied lagoons.",10.2112/SI78-011.1,NA,Desianti_2017_90074466,"Desianti, Nina; Potapova, Marina; Enache, Mihaela; Belton, Thomas J.; Velinsky, David J.; Thomas, Roger; Mead, Jerry"

In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.",10.1007/s10533-014-9989-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904805203&doi=10.1007%2fs10533-014-9989-7&partnerID=40&md5=a4d0e1ee5bb0b17de5a6be5f9f4a248c,Weston_2014_90075073,"Weston, Nathaniel B.; Neubauer, Scott C.; Velinsky, David J.; Vile, Melanie A."

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes.

Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.",10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a,Ferreira_2013_90074595,"Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

However, the consequences of freshwater input on bacteria and archaea remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Soil samples at a depth of 0-10 cm were collected in various kinds of Phragmites australis wetlands (flooded freshwater-restored (FW), nonflooding (PW) and tidal flooding (TW)) to investigate how the diversity and community structure of bacteria and archaea responded to freshwater input. The alpha-diversity metrics revealed that the bacterial richness and diversity in FW did not significantly differ from those in PW and TW (p 0.05). However, archaeal richness and diversity was higher in FW than in PW (p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Crenarchaeota constituted the predominant bacterial and archaeal phyla in FW, respectively, whereas Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Thaumarchaeota (archaea) exhibited the highest relative abundance in both PW and TW. The community structure of bacteria and archaea in TW differed from those in FW and PW, as revealed by beta diversity metrics and the analysis of similarities. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that the largest number of discriminating bacterial and archaeal taxa was found in TW. The Mantel test and Spearman correlation analysis showed that environmental variables (i.e. salinity, soil organic matter and soil texture) influenced the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure. And soil salinity parameters played a predominant role in shaping bacterial and archaeal communities.

In this study, coastal marsh soil profiles of two contrasting basins were investigated for lignin composition in order to assess organic matter source and degradation status under these different wetland formations. The Atchafalaya Basin is undergoing land building whereas the Barataria Basin is experiencing land loss. Lignin monomers were extracted using alkaline CuO oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Marsh soil profiles from the Barataria Basin showed strong lignin storage with two-fold higher lignin contents (sum of vanillyl, syringyl, and cinnamyl phenols, A(8)) than those in the Atchafalaya Basin. Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

Understanding these characteristics will help better to guide beneficial use of wetlands in processing nitrate. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and denitrification rate in Louisiana coastal wetlands. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from three different wetlands along a salinity gradient, namely, bottomland forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM) located in the Barataria Basin estuary. Potential denitrification rate (PDR) was measured by acetylene inhibition method and distribution of carbon (C) moieties in organic C was determined by C-13 solid-state NMR. Of the three wetlands, the FM soil profile exhibited the highest PDR on both unit weight and unit volume basis as compared to FS and SM. The FM also tended to yield higher amount of N2O as compared to the FS and SM especially at earlier stages of denitrification, suggesting incomplete reduction of NO3- at FM and potential for emission of N2O. Saline marsh soil profile had the lowest PDR on the unit volume basis. Increasing incubation concentration from 2 to 10 mg NO3--N L-1 increased PDR by 2 to 6 fold with the highest increase in the top horizons of FS and SM soils. Regression analysis showed that across these three wetland systems, organic C has significant effect in regulating PDR. Of the compositional C moieties, polysaccharides positively influenced denitrification. rate whereas phenolics (likely phenolic adehydes and ketonics) negatively affected denitrification rate in these wetland soils. These results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of wetlands for treating nutrient-rich biosolids and wastewaters, non-point source agricultural runoff, and nitrate found in the diverted Mississippi River water used for coastal restoration.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), ER (660.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), GEP (-2025.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD.

Total elemental contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate temporal variations in trace elements in soil profiles of the three salt marshes, assess the enrichment levels and ecological risks of these trace elements in three sampling seasons and identify their influencing factors. Trace elements did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in T. chinensis wetland. Compared to other elements, both Cd and As had higher enrichment factors exceeding moderate enrichment levels. However, the toxic unit (TU) values of these trace elements did not exceed probable effect levels. Correlation analysis showed that these trace elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture, sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values.

Open-top chambers (OTCs) were applied to simulate air-warming conditions.Based on the 2-year study, we found the following: (1) Averaged across the entire study period, the OTCs significantly increased the mean air temperature by 1.53 +/- 0.17 A degrees C. (2) The air warming resulted in no significant stimulation of the mean soil respiration averaged across the entire study period. Warming had no significant effect on soil respiration in the growing season, but it markedly reduced soil respiration by 16 % in the non-growing season.

Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET.

In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Observed differences were investigated based on the microbial activity and environmental factors of the soil at the two sites. Results showed that the organic carbon content of wetland soil vegetated with Phragmites australis (site A) was markedly lower than that with P australis and Spartina altemiflora (site B). Sites differences were due to higher microbial activity at site A, which led to higher soil respiration intensity and greater carbon outputs. This indicated that the capability of organic carbon accumulation of the site B soils was greater than at site A. In addition, petroleum pollution and soil salinity were different in the two wetland soils. After bio-remediation, the soil petroleum pollution at site B was reduced to a similar level of site A. However, the culturable microbial biomass and enzyme activity in the remediated soils were also lower than at site A. These results indicated that greater petroleum pollution at site B did not markedly inhibit soil microbial activity.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

The results indicated that the total SOC content at Area A (southeast of Dongtan, sandy soil with Phragmites communis) was only 46.11% of that of Area B (northeast of Dongtan, clay soil with mixed P. communis and Spartina alterniflora)(P= 0.000 < 0.05), but their organic matter input per year was almost identical. These findings implied that Area B had a lower output of SOC. The microbial biomass at Area A was 3.83 times greater than that at Area B (P= 0.049 < 0.05); the soil catalase and invertase activities at Area A, which were related to carbon metabolism, were 60.31% (P=0.006 < 0.05) and 34.33% (P=0.021 < 0.05) higher than at Area B, respectively; and the soil respiration at Area A was also higher than at Area B. These findings implied that the microbial activities at Area A were greater than those at Area B, and therefore the carbon metabolism was rapid, resulting in increased SOC output at Area A. Increased water content and salinity in the clay soil at Area B may inhibit the microbial activities, thereby reducing the decomposition of the organic matter and enhancing carbon sequestration. In addition, some artificial measures for controlling spread of S. alterniflora at Area B (mowing/digging and tillage (M + D); mowing/digging and tillage/waterlogging (M + D + W)) were found to generally improve the microbial activity of soil, thereby increasing SOC output. However, when the two different physical controlling modes were compared, the SOC and microbial activities of the soil subjected to the M + D + W treatment were relatively high and low, respectively, due to waterlogging restraining the microbial metabolism. These findings indicated that the difference in microbial activities was the important factor leading to variability in the SOC sequestration capability between Areas A and B. Additionally, with the exception of soil texture and vegetation types, environmental conditions and artificial turbulence also influenced microbial activities of soil, and hence SOC output and organic carbon sequestration capability.

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms.

Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities.

Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass.

JOUR,90075013,2004,NA," Wang, Y.",author_02,Dynamics of carbon sequestration in a coastal wetland using radiocarbon measurements,"[ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.",10.1029/2004GB002261,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-15944399352&doi=10.1029%2f2004GB002261&partnerID=40&md5=fae68dafe54e03ecb3da99e1f779e483,Choi_2004_90075013,"Choi, Y.; Wang, Y."

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107433584&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107875&partnerID=40&md5=c57f77f001595b38968fd0652dc8bd4f,Cui_2021_90074357,"Cui, Lina; Sun, Huimin; Du, Xuhua; Feng, Wenting; Wang, Yugang; Zhang, Jinchi; Jiang, Jiang"
JOUR,90075428,2019,NA," Wang, Yugang",author_05,Soil organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in a subtropical mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems,"Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

In the context of saline conditions, long-term effect of cultivation after reclamation on soil chemical properties has not been well understood. We studied this issue using a case of approximately 60-years cultivation of a coastal saline marsh in Bohai Rim, northern China. The results showed that long-term reclamation significantly decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) (-42.2%) and total nitrogen (TN) (-25.8%) at surface layer (0-30 cm) as well as their stratification ratios (SRs) (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm and 5-10 cm: 50-70 cm). However, there was no significant change in total phosphorus (TP) as well as its SRs under cultivation. Cultivation markedly reduced ratios of SOC to TN, SOC to TP and TN to TP at surface layer (0-30 cm) and their SRs (0-5 cm: 50-70 cm). After cultivation, electrical conductivity and salinity significantly decreased by 60.1% and 55.3% at 0-100 cm layer, respectively, suggesting a great desalinization. In contrast, soil pH at 20-70 cm horizons notably increased as an effect of reclamation. Cultivation also changed compositions of cations at 0-10 cm layer and anions at 5-100 cm layer, mainly decreasing the proportion of Na+, Cl- and SO42-. Furthermore, cultivation significantly reduced the sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage in plow-layer (0-20 cm) but not residual sodium carbonate, suggesting a reduction in sodium harm.",10.1371/journal.pone.0093727,NA,Wang_2014_90074583,"Wang, Yidong; Wang, Zhong-Liang; Feng, Xiaoping; Guo, Changcheng; Chen, Qing"
JOUR,90075456,2020,NA," Wang, Zhong-Liang",author_10,Conversion of coastal marshes to croplands decreases organic carbon but increases inorganic carbon in saline soils,"Over the past century, conversion to agriculture has greatly reduced the global extent of coastal wetlands leading to degradation and loss of these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.",10.1002/ldr.3538,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078656687&doi=10.1002%2fldr.3538&partnerID=40&md5=23e583e88350f309dc61605d090b24bc,Zhu_2020_90075456,"Zhu, Yuanshan; Wang, Yidong; Guo, Changcheng; Xue, Dongmei; Li, Jun; Chen, Qing; Song, Zhaoliang; Lou, Yilai; Kuzyakov, Yakov; Wang, Zhong-Liang; Jones, Davey L."

We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing.

At the same time, fiddler crab (Uca spp.) distributions have expanded and purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing on creekbank vegetation has increased. Sea-level rise and reduced predation pressure drive these changing crab populations but most studies focus on one species; there is a need for community-level assessments of impacts from multiple crab species. There is also a need to identify additional factors that can affect crab populations. We sampled crabs and environmental parameters in four Rhode Island salt marshes in 2014 and compiled existing data to quantify trends in crab abundance and multiple factors that potentially affect crabs. Crab communities were dominated by fiddler and green crabs (Carcinus maenas); S. reticulatum was much less abundant. Burrow sizes suggest that Uca is responsible for most burrows. On the marsh platform, burrows and Carcinus abundance were negatively correlated with elevation, soil moisture, and soil percent organic matter and positively correlated with soil bulk density. Uca abundance was negatively correlated with Spartina patens cover and height and positively correlated with Spartina alterniflora cover and soil shear strength. Creekbank burrow density increased dramatically between 1998 and 2016. During the same time, fishing effort and the abundance of birds that prey on crabs decreased, and water levels increased. Unlike in other southern New England marshes where recreational overfishing is hypothesized to drive increasing marsh crab abundance, we propose that changes in crab abundance were likely unrelated to recreational finfish over-harvest; instead, they better track sea-level rise and changing abundances of alternate predators, such as birds. We predict that marsh crab abundance will continue to expand with ongoing sea-level rise, at least until inundation thresholds for crab survival are exceeded.",10.7717/peerj.4876,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047810574&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.4876&partnerID=40&md5=64d96b0db049718822a0d71a2f200d1e,Raposa_2018_90075418,"Raposa, Kenneth B.; McKinney, Richard A.; Wigand, Cathleen; Hollister, Jeffrey W.; Lovall, Cassie; Szura, Katelyn; Gurak, John A., Jr.; McNamee, Jason; Raithel, Christopher; Watson, Elizabeth B."

Recently, conflicting results of N loading impacts on microbial mediated organic matter decomposition in coastal wetland soils have been reported. However, to date, the majority of studies have investigated short-term nutrient loading effects while few have reported long-term integrated impacts.

We measured soil (0-10 cm) physiochemical characteristics, soil microbial biomass N, and measures of biogeochemical cycling of N, including potentially mineralizable nitrogen and denitrification rates. Our results show that soil total P increased with P additions, but no significant differences in measures of soil microbial biomass or activity occurred with N, P, or N x P loading. We conclude that long-term N loading at rates equivalent to Mississippi River diversions had no persistent lasting effects on total N or examined soil microbial measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sandy sediment dredged from the bed of the Mississippi River was placed at targeted locations in Barataria Bayin an effort to restore and protect coastal Louisiana marshes. This study sought to determine how comparable these dredged river-sediment marsh soils are to those of the surrounding natural marshes in Barataria Bay. Percent organic matter in the created marsh was 11.6% of the natural marsh. Extractable ammonium and extractable nitrate in the created marsh soils were 15.4% and 8.75% of the natural marsh. In the created marsh, the beta-glucosidase enzyme activity was 10.3% and soil oxygen demand was 11.2% of the natural marsh, reflecting significantly lower soil microbial processes within the created marshsites. Associated ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and nutrient availability for support of primary production, are consequently significantly lower in the newly created wetland soil.

Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively.

Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion.

The majority of studies on coastal land loss use aerial and satellite photographic analysis while field and site-specific measurements are limited. The aim of this study was to spatially and temporally measure coastal marsh edge erosion and investigate factors responsible for differences in erosion including shoreline orientation, soil physio-chemical properties, and wind speed and duration. A total of 33 transects across six island sites in northern Barataria Basin, Louisiana were established. Transects on shorelines facing different compass directions were measured for erosion for up to 2 years. Soils were analyzed for physiochemical properties including bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Bathymetric surveys were conducted to determine the extent of the erosive bay bottom profile. In addition, C-14 dating of the basal organic matter (1.5-1.6 m) was conducted. Erosion rates ranged from 49.27 to 324.85 cm y(-1) with a mean value of 141.69 +/- 22.45 cm y(-1). As expected, erosion rates were significantly different (p < 0.001) between protected and unprotected sites. The erosion rate was not correlated with wind speed (r = -0.07), weakly correlated with compass direction of shoreline (r = 0.25) and water level (r = 0.25) but strongly correlated with duration of wind (r = 0.60). Erosion rate was negatively correlated (r = -0.45) with bulk density and positively correlated with organic matter content (r = 0.42) of the top 40 cm of the soil. Over time, the marsh is eroded down to a depth of 1.5 m, which correlates to annual loss of 1.82 +/- 0.29 m(3) volume of marsh per meter shoreline length including a loss of organic matter (141.5 +/- 22.55 kg m(-1)) and carbon (63.32 +/- 10.09 kg m(-1)) previously preserved for up to 850 years. As a consequence, annual CO2 emissions for Barataria Basin were estimated to be 1.56 +/- 0.26 million tCO(2)e y(-1). Results can inform coastal managers as to the most vulnerable marshes to target restoration efforts. Due to high relative sea level rise in coastal Louisiana, these results can also be used to inform the world's stable coastlines on the relative vulnerability of their coastal marshes in the near future, due to projected eustatic sea level.

However, the rapid expansion of open water areas has been associated with marsh degradation and there is a growing need for detailed studies as coastal wetlands continue to degrade under increasing rates of sea level rise and related stressors. Yet, few studies investigate soil physicochemical and biogeochemical properties within different marsh landscape features, which could provide insight into mechanisms of the formation and expansion of open water areas. The current study compared wetland soil physical and microbial properties observed in vegetated areas with shallow open water areas called panties, identifying a number of significant differences. Panne soils possessed lower bulk density, total C, N, P, SOC, DOC, and SRP compared with vegetated marsh areas, suggesting a shift in nutrient pools as vegetated areas transition into shallow open water features. Panne features also displayed significantly lower microbial pool sizes and processing rates than vegetated marsh soils, suggesting reduced capacity for nutrient processing in open water areas. Further, extractable NH4-N was highest in the panne soils suggesting that the absence of macrophytes decreased N uptake in open water areas. Also related to the lack of vascular plants, extractable DOC in panties averaged less than half the concentration found in vegetated marsh areas, despite a smaller difference in soil total C.

Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.",10.1890/10-2037.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051955666&doi=10.1890%2f10-2037.1&partnerID=40&md5=e96b2c3ff336749aa1cda07f28f373eb,Davey_2011_90074559,"Davey, Earl; Wigand, Cathleen; Johnson, Roxanne; Sundberg, Karen; Morris, James; Roman, Charles T."

At the same time, fiddler crab (Uca spp.) distributions have expanded and purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing on creekbank vegetation has increased. Sea-level rise and reduced predation pressure drive these changing crab populations but most studies focus on one species; there is a need for community-level assessments of impacts from multiple crab species. There is also a need to identify additional factors that can affect crab populations. We sampled crabs and environmental parameters in four Rhode Island salt marshes in 2014 and compiled existing data to quantify trends in crab abundance and multiple factors that potentially affect crabs. Crab communities were dominated by fiddler and green crabs (Carcinus maenas); S. reticulatum was much less abundant. Burrow sizes suggest that Uca is responsible for most burrows. On the marsh platform, burrows and Carcinus abundance were negatively correlated with elevation, soil moisture, and soil percent organic matter and positively correlated with soil bulk density. Uca abundance was negatively correlated with Spartina patens cover and height and positively correlated with Spartina alterniflora cover and soil shear strength. Creekbank burrow density increased dramatically between 1998 and 2016. During the same time, fishing effort and the abundance of birds that prey on crabs decreased, and water levels increased. Unlike in other southern New England marshes where recreational overfishing is hypothesized to drive increasing marsh crab abundance, we propose that changes in crab abundance were likely unrelated to recreational finfish over-harvest; instead, they better track sea-level rise and changing abundances of alternate predators, such as birds. We predict that marsh crab abundance will continue to expand with ongoing sea-level rise, at least until inundation thresholds for crab survival are exceeded.",10.7717/peerj.4876,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047810574&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.4876&partnerID=40&md5=64d96b0db049718822a0d71a2f200d1e,Raposa_2018_90075418,"Raposa, Kenneth B.; McKinney, Richard A.; Wigand, Cathleen; Hollister, Jeffrey W.; Lovall, Cassie; Szura, Katelyn; Gurak, John A., Jr.; McNamee, Jason; Raithel, Christopher; Watson, Elizabeth B."

Monthly samples were collected during the period from February 1998 to February 1999 in both parts of the lagoon. Ventrosia maritima displayed an annual life cycle. Recruitment occurred in summer and autumn at the outer part of the lagoon and additionally in late winter at the innermost part. A positive correlation was found between the percentages of small individuals and salinity or sediment organic matter at the outer part. Growth practically ceased in winter. The mudsnail displayed remarkable densities and an increase in growth in spring at < 1 psu indicating that it is highly tolerant to extremely low salinities. Population density showed a significant seasonal variation; it increased from early summer to autumn (30,000-40,000 individuals m(-2)) following the summer and autumn recruitment. No significant correlation between the density of V. maritima and several examined physicochemical variables was found; a negative correlation was observed between the density of the mudisnail and that of the co-occurring polychaete Streblospio shrubsolii. Secondary production calculated by the size-frequency method gave a mean annual density (N) of 9740 ind m(-2), a mean biomass (B) of 1.66 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m(-2) y(-1), a production (P) of 4.51 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 2.72 at the outer part of the lagoon and a N of 14,570 ind m(-2), a B of 3.2 g AFDW m(-2) y(-1), a P of 9.9 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 3.09 at the innermost part. At the innermost part of the lagoon, where the seawater renewal rate and hydro-dynamism were lower and the sediment finer and organically richer, V. maritima displayed more recruitment pulses, a larger body size and a denser and more productive population than the one at the outer part.

As a correct species assignment is crucial for ecological studies, the data presented here are substantiated using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genome to verify the systematic status of the mudsnail taxon in question. A comparative molecular analysis involving almost all brackish-water taxa of Hydrobiinae indicates that the populations from the Evros Delta belong to the Pontic species Ventrosia maritima, a taxon that was not reported before from the Mediterranean. Moreover, it appears that in previous studies, the mudsnail populations from the Evros Delta were misidentified. Principal Component Analyses using environmental variables defined station groups among which V maritima showed a significant variation in density. Mudsnail specimens were absent at stations with an immediate access to the sea (salinity 32 - 34 PSU, very fine to fine sand, organic matter 0.3 -1.4 %), they showed intermediate densities (up to 3,000 ind./m(2)) in innermost lagoonal parts (34-35 PSU, very fine sand, organic matter 1.0-1.4 %) and relatively high densities (up to 7,000 ind./m(2)) only in isolated parts (15-17 PSU, fine sand, organic matter 0.5-0.8 %). Contact with the sea, which is strongly correlated with seawater renewal rate and hydrodynamism, was found to be the most important factor affecting mudsnail distributions. The data presented, being the first detailed ecological information available for V. maritima, are compared with the available information for other mudsnail taxa.

JOUR,90074365,2013,NA," Wilson, Alicia M.",author_03,Tracing mercury seawater vs. atmospheric inputs in a pristine SE USA salt marsh system: Mercury isotope evidence,"Salt marshes can be a significant source of MeHg in coastal marine organisms, however the sources and cycling of Hg in salt marsh sediments, and in coastal environments in general, remain unclear. We analyzed surface and cored sediments from a salt marsh and adjacent upland sand dune in Cabretta Island, Georgia, USA, for total mercury (Hg-T), Hg isotopes and trace metal concentrations to better constrain the sources of Hg in this coastal environment. Hg-T concentrations are lower in the upland sands (1-6 ng/g) than in the marsh sediments (6-16 ng/g). Hg-T shows a positive correlation with total organic content (TOC) and increasing proportion of fines in the sediments. Trace metal concentrations also show a positive correlation with Hg-T in the marsh sediments regardless of chemical affinity (i.e. chalcophile, siderophile or lithophile). All these data are consistent with surface adsorption (either directly on to sediments or on to organic matter) as a dominant mechanism of Hg and metals accumulation in the marsh sediments. The surface sediments show significant mass independent fractionation (MIF) of odd Hg isotopes: the upland dune sands have zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199 (-0.07 parts per thousand to -0.14 parts per thousand) and the marsh surface sediments have positive Delta Hg-199 (0.48 parts per thousand to 0.79 parts per thousand). As in the surface samples, well-sorted sand layers in the cored sediments have low Hg concentrations and zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199, whereas fine particle-rich layers have higher Hg concentrations and positive Delta Hg-199 values. In the absence of any evidence for MIF of Hg isotopes by bacteria mediated methylation-demethylation reactions, the observed Hg isotope differences between marsh and upland sands can be explained by different sources of Hg. We suggest that local atmospheric Hg deposition dominates the Hg budget in the ombrotrophic upland sand, while the positive MIF in the marsh sediments are consistent with Hg dominantly of seawater origin. While in situ processes, like photoreduction and evasion can overprint the Hg depositional isotope signature, their effect on the sediments is currently unconstrained. Nevertheless, our data show that Hg isotopes can delineate different sources of Hg in a pristine coastal environment and at small spatial scales. Thus natural background isotope variability should be assessed as a baseline when Hg isotopes are used as tracers of Hg in anthropogenically-influenced sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We used delta C-13 to trace carbon origins. We found that groundwater releases large amounts of carbon to the open ocean.

To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA.

Several sources of variation can lead to spatial differences in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species including: biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg production and availability within an organism's home range; trophic positions of consumers and MeHg biomagnification efficiency in food webs; and individual prey preferences that influence diet composition. To better understand spatial variation in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species, we evaluated the effects of habitat biogeochemistry, food web structure, and diet composition in the wetland-obligate California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) at three wetlands along the Petaluma River in northern San Francisco Bay, California, USA. The concentration of MeHg in sediments differed significantly among wetlands. We identified three sediment and porewater measurements that contributed significantly to a discriminant function explaining differences in habitat biogeochemistry among wetlands: the porewater concentration of ferrous iron, the percent organic matter, and the sediment MeHg concentration. Food web structure and biomagnification efficiency were similar among wetlands, with trophic magnification factors for MeHg ranging from 1.84 to 2.59. In addition, regurgitation samples indicated that black rails were dietary generalists with similar diets among wetlands (percent similarity indices > 70%). Given the similarities in diet composition, food web structure, and MeHg biomagnification efficiency among wetlands, we concluded that variation in habitat biogeochemistry and associated sediment MeHg production was the primary driver of differences in MeHg concentrations among black rails from different wetlands.

Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame.

This study describes relationships between benthic foraminiferal assemblages and environmental variables, such as wetland elevation, pore-water salinity, substrate organic matter content and sediment grainsize. Agglutinated taxa dominated higher in the tidal frame, whereas calcareous taxa increased in both relative abundance and diversity lower in the tidal frame. Species composition varied within and between study sites, reflecting local differences in other environmental variables. Three major spatial clusters were identified in the upper intertidal zone from a dataset consisting of 111 contemporary samples: a high-to mid-elevation assemblage consisting of differing abundances of Entzia macrescens and Trochammina inflata; a mid-elevation assemblage comprised of Arenoparrella mexicana in association with Trochammina inflata and Quinqueloculina seminula; and mid-to low-elevation assemblage characterised by Cribroelphidium excavatum, Quinqueloculina seminula, Ammobaculites spp. and Miliammina fusca. Multivariate analysis correlated foraminiferal assemblages with environmental variables showing that foraminiferal distribution in the region is constrained primarily by wetland elevation, but also by pore-water salinity. Foraminiferal assemblages derived from cluster analysis correlated with vegetation zones, implying that both foraminifera and vegetation are influenced by elevation and salinity. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the consistency in spatial zonation of assemblages provides greater confidence that contemporary distribution of foraminiferal assemblages can assist with the interpretation of past depositional conditions and palaeo-environmental reconstructions, providing insights into the evolution of coastal wetlands of south-eastern Australia over the Holocene.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106949,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090215169&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106949&partnerID=40&md5=39a90a96bc59b4be76b5c729191307a5,Lal_2020_90075026,"Lal, Kirti K.; Bonetti, Carla; Woodroffe, Colin D.; Rogers, Kerrylee"
JOUR,90075060,2020,NA," Woodroffe, Colin D.",author_04,Temperate coastal wetland near-surface carbon storage: Spatial patterns and variability,"Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous, nevertheless are commonly described on the basis of vegetation distribution within the intertidal zone. Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106584,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077913513&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106584&partnerID=40&md5=e6a1ecd17713d251da68451818868114,Owers_2020_90075060,"Owers, Christopher J.; Rogers, Kerrylee; Mazumder, Debashish; Woodroffe, Colin D."

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR.

However, the roles of the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence in regulating soil dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction processes (denitrification (DNF), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANA) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) remains unclear. The objective of this study was therefore to reveal the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance.We investigated plant biomass, soil properties, NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance of NO3 (-) reduction pathways following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequences of 6, 10, and 14 years compared to Cyperus malaccensis in a coastal wetland of southeastern China.The S. alterniflora invasion generally increased plant biomass, soil water content, available substrates, nirS, anammox bacterial 16S rRNA and nrfA gene abundance, but it decreased soil bulk density. Soil DNF, ANA and DNRA rates in stands of S. alterniflora ranged from 1.52 to 17.58, 0.31 to 1.27 and 0.14 to 2.01 nmol N g(-1) h(-1), respectively, which were generally higher than the values in stands of C. malaccensis. The soil NO3 (-) reduction rates generally increased with the increasing chronosequence of invasion by S. alterniflora, while the changes in DNF and ANA rates were less pronounced than changes in DNRA. DNF was the dominant pathway (70.00-92.41%), and the ANA and DNRA contributed 2.49-15.27% and 5.10-20.75% to the total NO3 (-) reduction, respectively. The contributions of DNF and ANA to the total NO3 (-) reduction decreased slightly, while the contribution of DNRA increased remarkably after S. alterniflora invasion. Soil NO3 (-) reduction processes were influenced by available substrates and associated microbial activities. It is estimated that an N loss of approximately 520.97 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in C. malaccensis and 794.46 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in S. alterniflora were linked to both DNF and ANA processes.The S. alterniflora invasion altered soil NO3 (-) reduction processes by increasing soil microbial activities and available substrates and thus may further mediate the soil N availability in the coastal wetlands.",10.1007/s11104-017-3464-x,NA,Gao_2017_90075235,"Gao, Dengzhou; Li, Xiaofei; Lin, Xianbiao; Wu, Dianming; Jin, Baoshi; Huang, Yanping; Liu, Min; Chen, Xing"

Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community.

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors.

To comprehensively evaluate the ecological effects of livestock grazing and tidal flooding on salt marshes, we conducted a grazing-exclusion experiment in the high and middle marsh zones of the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Livestock grazing generally enhanced EMF in the salt marshes, with a stronger impact in the middle marshes than in the high ones.

JOUR,90075473,2020,NA," Wu, Jihua",author_04,"Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on saltmarsh nitrogen removal in the Yangtze River Estuary, China","Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90075123,2007,NA," Wu, Ying",author_02,"Spatial variations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur in the salt marsh sediments of the Yangtze Estuary in China","Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

JOUR,90074244,2014,NA," Xi, Xuefei",author_06,Variability in soil microbial community and activity between coastal and riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary - Potential impacts on carbon sequestration,"Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to the higher soil microbial biomass, the MZ had more -Proteobacteria than the CZ, as well as some specific bacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity such as Pseudomonas sp. and Limnobacter sp. that might have led to its higher dehydrogenase activity and respiratory rates. Additionally, the CZ possessed more Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with the ability to fix CO2 than the MZ. Significantly lower soil salinity in MZ (4.25gkg(-1)) was suitable for -Proteobacteria, but detrimental for Halobacteria compared with CZ (7.09gkg(-1), p<.01), which might lead to the lower microbial decomposition capacity of soils in CZ.

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.

Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.",10.1007/s00253-013-5104-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894298106&doi=10.1007%2fs00253-013-5104-6&partnerID=40&md5=9aef56de1efef0314e84be799212a6ac,Yuan_2014_90074341,"Yuan, Junji; Ding, Weixin; Liu, Deyan; Xiang, Jian; Lin, Yongxin"

CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively.

In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites.

Correlation analysis indicated that soil organic matter, moisture, large aggregates as well as electric conductivity were key factors influencing metal distributions in these zones.

Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes.

Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly raised C and N concentrations in SOM, labile and recalcitrant pools compared to bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils. Spartina alterniflora soil had higher recalcitrant index for C relative to bare flat. The proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C and the decomposition rate of old C in the labile pool were significantly higher than those in the recalcitrant pool. However, the S. alterniflora-derived C stock of the recalcitrant pool was much greater than that of the labile pool.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of potential interactive effects between plant traits and tidal disturbances in regulating biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon sequestration, in coastal saltmarsh systems.",10.1002/ecs2.2642,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080983518&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2642&partnerID=40&md5=e9c2726d6dbd6cd5b6a0aecda5bc7c82,Wang_2019_90074770,"Wang, Fangfang; Yan, Jiaguo; Ma, Xu; Qiu, Dongdong; Xie, Tian; Cui, Baoshan"

Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa. Thus, we recommend managers help alleviate soil abiotic stresses in the intertidal salt marshes, making the soil conditions more suitable for S. salsa growth and succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides.

Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa. Thus, we recommend managers help alleviate soil abiotic stresses in the intertidal salt marshes, making the soil conditions more suitable for S. salsa growth and succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90075213,2017,NA," Yang, P.",author_05,Changes of community structure and abundance of methanogens in soils along a freshwater-brackish water gradient in subtropical estuarine marshes,"Methane emissions from wetlands contribute to the currently rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) also play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively. The abundance of both methanogens and SRB in the sediment of the P. australis marsh with the highest sediment organic carbon content was higher than in the C. malaccensis and S. alterniflora marshes. Mean pore water DMS concentrations over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile under the S. alterniflora marsh were higher than those in the C. malaccensis marsh and P. australis marsh. Methane production rate correlated weakly with the abundance of methanogens across the three marsh zones together, but did not correlate with the concentrations of pore water acetate and DMS. Our results suggest that the abundance of methanogens is controlled by sediment organic carbon supply, and further, methane production is affected by the abundance of methanogens in the subtropical estuarine brackish marshes.",10.1007/s12237-014-9930-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943350835&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-014-9930-2&partnerID=40&md5=bab2330041b343b09fc85c646fff054c,Tong_2015_90075222,"Tong, C.; She, C.

Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05).

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

We examined Gulf sturgeon physical habitat attributes and infaunal macrobenthic prey density and composition both spatially and seasonally relative to acoustically tagged Gulf sturgeon occurrence in the Pascagoula River estuary. Gulf sturgeon occupancy patterns indicated that adults move quickly through the system during fall and spring compared to longer but more spatially and temporally variable occupancy for juveniles and sub-adults in both seasons; sub-adults exhibited a less spatially and temporally variable occupancy pattern. We found significant differences in physical habitat and macrobenthic density characteristics that partially explained Gulf sturgeon spatial and temporal occupancy patterns. Direct comparisons of physical drivers (% silt, depth, particulate organic carbon) and macrobenthic density patterns (BEST procedures) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) but weak (global R = 0.277) and suggest alternate hypotheses to better explain the differential estuarine habitat use patterns.

This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity in different estuarine and intertidal habitats via quantitative PCR and C-13 stable isotope experiments. The results showed that Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (M. oxyfera)-like DAMO bacteria and Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. nitroreducens)-like DAMO archaea cooccurred in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with a relatively higher abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene (4.0 x 10(6)-7.6 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) than the M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene (4.5 x 10(5) -9.4 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment). The abundance of the M. oxyfera-like bacterial pmoA gene was closely associated with sediment pH and ammonium (P<0.05), while no significant relationship was detected between M. nitroreducens-like archaeal mcrA gene abundance and the measured environmental parameters (P>0.05). High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea.

In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

JOUR,90074475,1997,NA," Yoch, D.C.",author_02,Spartina alterniflora dieback recovery correlates with increased acetylene reduction activity in saltmarsh sediments,"Spartina alterniflora salt marshes occasionally exhibit areas where the plants have all died off for no apparent reason. These dieback areas remain devoid of plant growth for months to years. An analysis of microbial acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and porewater chemistry of four such diebacks has been carried out on marshes in the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, U.S.A. Four different diebacks were studied and sediments in all of them showed low rates of ARA, relative to sediments from the control areas which were populated by healthy S. alterniflora plants. The pore water of all the dieback sediments had higher salinities than the controls when this study began, but this trend was not consistent over the 18-month study period. Furthermore, dissolved ammonium and sulfide in the pore water, microbial biomass, organic matter and macro-organic matter content did not show a consistent trend differentiating the control and dieback sediments over this study period. During the course of this study, one of the diebacks recovered and the recolonisation of the barren area with healthy plants correlated with a full recovery of sediment ARA. The return of ARA to the sediments of this recovered marsh could not be correlated, however, with any of the porewater parameters measured (including NH4+), nor with any of the sediment characteristics. It is concluded that the lower levels of bacterial ARA in the diebacks may be due to the lack of essential factors associated with healthy spartina plants.

Dimethylselenoniopropionate, a possible precursor of dimethylselenide, is the selenium analogue of the common marine osmoprotectant, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Dimethylselenoniopropionate was organically synthesized from dimethylselenide and acrylate and used in a comparative study with dimethylsulfoniopropionate as a growth substrate, an inducer and substrate for dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in two marine bacterial isolates, Alcaligenes sp. strain M3A and Pseudomonas doudoroffii, and in salt marsh sediments and estuarine creek water samples. In P. doudoroffii, the rate of dimethylselenoniopropionate transport into cells was about half that observed with dimethylsulfoniopropionate; Alcaligenes does not take up these molecules. The rate and extent of induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in P. doudoroffii at low concentrations of dimethylselenoniopropionate were similar to that of dimethylsulfoniopropionate. In Alcaligenes the low constitutive level of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase cleaved dimethylselenoniopropionate into dimethylselenide and acrylate, but induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase by dimethylselenoniopropionate did not follow. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyases from both strains, when induced by dimethylsulfoniopropionate, utilized dimethylselenoniopropionate as a substrate with emission of dimethylselenide. Rates of partially purified dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity with dimethylselenoniopropionate were half those with dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Anoxic salt marsh sediments catalyzed dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylselenoniopropionate degradation at equal rates. In sediments containing high organic matter, both dimethylsulfide and dimethylselenide served as substrates for methanogenesis.

Despite this issue, virtually nothing is known on local plant species exposure to metal contaminants, nor their ability to uptake and translocate metal(loid)s from contaminated estuarine sediment. In the current study, we assessed the accumulation and partitioning of the metal(loid)s Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Se in the dominant saltmarsh primary producer, Sporobolus virginicus, across three urbanised estuaries in NSW Australia. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, while Sydney Olympic Park, Port Jackson exhibited intermediate metal(loid) loadings and Hunter Wetlands exhibited the lowest loadings among estuaries. Essential metals (Zn and Cu) were more mobile, with sediment:root bioconcentration factors (BCFs) greater than unity and translocation among plant organs greater than, or equal to, unity. Other metal(loid)s were less mobile, with BCFs equal to unity and translocation factors among organs much reduced. Despite these barriers to translocation, all metal(loid)s were accumulated to roots with dose, and further accumulative relationships between metal(loid)s in roots and culms, and culms and leaves, were evidenced (with the exception of Cu). Along with sediment metal(loid)s, increases in sediment pH predicted Cu uptake in roots and increases in soil organic matter predicted Se uptake in roots. Although significant positive linear relationships were observed between sediment metal (loid)s and plant organ metal(loid)s(withholding Cu), the variance explained was low to intermediate for most metal(loid)s suggesting employing S. virginicus as an accumulative bioindicator would be impractical.

To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1).

The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone.

However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR.

Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference.

S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.",10.3390/ijerph16112043,NA,Hu_2019_90075112,"Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng"

To determine the effect of an alien species (Spartina alterniflora) invasion on the decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics of litter in the Min River estuary, three communities with differing levels of invasion, namely, a Cyperus malaccensis community (before invasion, BI stage), a S. alterniflora community (after invasion, AI stage), and a C. malaccensis-S. alterniflora community (during invasion, DI stage), were studied using the space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79% faster than that of S. alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the C/N and lignin. Compared with S. alterniflora, the N (nitrogen) and S (sulfur) concentrations of litter in C. malaccensis were significantly higher. The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage.

Results show that both the SOC and TN stocks varied seasonally, following an order of winter > autumn > summer > spring, and accumulated with the time passing by, and varied spatially, too, showing a decreasing order of Phagmites australis belt in high tidal marsh > Spartina alterniflora belt in medium-tidal marsh > Scirpus mariqueter belt in low-tidal marsh > bare mudflat.

This study was undertaken to understand the potential for soil respiration changes in a disturbed coastal ecosystem under future atmospheric warmingAn in situ simulated warming experiment was conducted in a reclaimed salt marsh on Chongming Island in the Yangtze Estuary, China. Open-top chambers (OTCs) were applied to simulate air-warming conditions.Based on the 2-year study, we found the following: (1) Averaged across the entire study period, the OTCs significantly increased the mean air temperature by 1.53 +/- 0.17 A degrees C. (2) The air warming resulted in no significant stimulation of the mean soil respiration averaged across the entire study period. Warming had no significant effect on soil respiration in the growing season, but it markedly reduced soil respiration by 16 % in the non-growing season. (3) Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature or volumetric moisture at a 5 cm depth, but it increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119 % averaged across the entire study period. (4) Air warming had no significant effect on total organic carbon, total nitrogen or the molar C/molar N ratio of the soil in the uppermost 10 cm layer during the 2 years of soil respiration measurement. The warming treatment also had no significant effect on aboveground biomass or fine root (< 2 mm) density during the second year of soil respiration measurement. (5) Soil temperature accounted for 81.0 % and 79.0 % of the temporal variations of soil respiration in the control (CON) and elevated temperature (ET) plots, respectively. No significant correlation between soil volumetric moisture and soil respiration was observed in either CON or ET. Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET. No change of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10) value) was observed.Based on above results, we speculate that soil porewater salinity was the key factor controlling the effects of air warming on soil respiration in the reclaimed salt marsh. Our results suggest that an air warming of approximately 1.5 A degrees C over the next few decades may not lead to a higher soil respiration in reclaimed salt marshes.",10.1007/s11104-013-1707-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884816335&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-1707-z&partnerID=40&md5=eedd2483ca4e0aafe4cafee3cdaf656b,Zhong_2013_90074463,"Zhong, Qicheng; Du, Qin; Gong, Jinnan; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Kaiyun"
JOUR,90074510,2017,NA," Zhang, Chao",author_04,"Soil carbon and nitrogen storage in recently restored and mature native Scirpus marshes in the Yangtze Estuary, China: Implications for restoration","As part of research into the re-establishment of the native species Scirpus mariqueter in the salt marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, the roles of revegetation mode (planting density), site characteristics (sediment texture and hydrological regime) and community age (recently restored and mature marshes) in the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) were examined. In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption.

Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils.

Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3.

However, little information is available on the relationship between hydrologic conditions and denitrification. In this study three typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including short-term flooding wetlands (STFW), seasonal-flooding wetlands (SFW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) were chosen as the study sites in the Yellow River Delta. In contrast, five typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including 100-year floodplain (H), 10-year floodplain (T), 5-year floodplain (F), 1-year floodplain (O) and permanently flooded floodplain (B) were chosen as the study sites in Xianghai wetlands. This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes. Generally, higher flooding frequencies will cause higher denitrification rates in salt marshes. Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes. Therefore, the changes in soil properties (e.g. SOM, TN, pH and salinity) can become an important way to control NO3- levels in inland salt marshes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.",10.1038/srep34835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990817882&doi=10.1038%2fsrep34835&partnerID=40&md5=24912372ff0e19e750b300a353200145,Bai_2016_90075381,"Bai, Junhong; Zhang, Guangliang; Zhao, Qingqing; Lu, Qiongqiong; Jia, Jia; Cui, Baoshan; Liu, Xinhui"

Our results showed that there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils among the five sampling sites (p > 0.05), whereas significant differences were observed between June and other months (p < 0.05) following the order June > August > November > April. Generally, available phosphorus (AP) contents also showed a fluctuation in different sampling periods and there were significant differences between November and August and April at 10-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). The soil P supply was generally lower with lower AP:TP ratios less than 2%. Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter. The findings indicated that seasonal changes in soil P should be given more concerns to minimize the eutrophication risk of water bodies in coastal wetlands and guide the flow and sediment regulation regime of the upstream reservoir.

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107433584&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107875&partnerID=40&md5=c57f77f001595b38968fd0652dc8bd4f,Cui_2021_90074357,"Cui, Lina; Sun, Huimin; Du, Xuhua; Feng, Wenting; Wang, Yugang; Zhang, Jinchi; Jiang, Jiang"
JOUR,90075428,2019,NA," Zhang, Jinchi",author_06,Soil organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in a subtropical mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems,"Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

Chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the features of these HSs. The results indicate that the studied HSs in the salt marsh sediments are mainly terrestrial-derived and that the sedimentary organic matter (SUM) in the top layer may contain more organic matter from marine sources and/or autochthonous materials due to the dramatic decreasing of the sediment supply as a result of damming. The degradation of labile carbohydrates and proteins and the preservation of refractory lignin components dominate the early diagenetic reactions of SUM in the salt marsh area. The average contents of the carboxylic groups in FAs and HAs are 11.64 +/- 1.08 and 7.13 +/- 0.16 meq/gC, and those of phenolic groups are 1.95 +/- 0.13 and 2.40 +/- 0.44 meq/gC, respectively. The content of carboxylic groups increased with increasing depth, while there were no obvious changes in the content of phenolic groups. The average concentration of total proton-binding sites is approximately 12.5 mu mol/g sediment for the studied HSs. These values may provide insight into the migration and fate of HS-bound contaminants in sediments and the overlying sea water in the salt marsh areas of the Changjiang Estuary.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90075123,2007,NA," Zhang, Jing",author_04,"Spatial variations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur in the salt marsh sediments of the Yangtze Estuary in China","Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

A monitoring program before and after restoration has been carried out in the study area located in the Yellow River Delta since 2001. Water quality, soil salinity. soil organic matter, plant community. and bird species were chosen as indicators in this program. During the past seven years, the restored wetland showed increasing efficiency in reducing water pollution levels. Soil quality was constantly improved through salinity reduction and soil organic matter accumulation. The vegetation community quickly re-established after the restoration was initiated in 2002. The restored vegetation communities provide favorable habitat conditions for birds and thirty-seven bird species were observed in October 2007. Based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plant species and vegetation community are mainly influenced by soil salinity and water depth. These indicate that conducting freshwater to the project area is an efficient measure for vegetation restoration. While monitoring results show that the restoration project had positive effects on the wetland ecosystem over the past seven years, two issues remain for future study: (1) the contribution of harvesting vegetation to stabilizing nutrient removal rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter in the soil; and (2) the effects of excessive propagation of Phragmites australis on spatial heterogeneity and plant diversity.

Results showed that the conversions mainly occurred between dry lands and Phragmites australis-Suaeda salsa-Tamarix chinensis marshes (PSTMs). The total area of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986 to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH, salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH, salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in NO3--N. TN (total nitrogen), and AP (available phosphorus) (P < 0.05) was observed. The more loss of soil nutrient storage also occurred after the maximal area conversion from PSTMs to dry lands compared to other conversions during the study period.

Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils.

The Lorentz models were ideal for the relationships among SOC, TN and electrical conductivity (EC), indicating that certain EC values could improve carbon and nitrogen accumulation. The theoretical threshold of EC for the maximum SOC and SOCs was 2.2 ms/cm, and the maximum TN and TNs highly depended on groundwater tables (0.9-1.0 ms/cm for LW, 1.6-1.8 ms/cm for MW and 3.0 ms/cm for HW).

Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference.

S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon.

NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.",10.3390/ijerph16112043,NA,Hu_2019_90075112,"Hu, Weifang; Zhang, Wenlong; Zhang, Linhai; Tong, Chuan; Sun, Zhigao; Chen, Yuehmin; Zeng, Congsheng"

Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %). Most soil aggregates had residual Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and reducible Cd, Pb dominated in the total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates. Although mud soil showed low total concentrations of heavy metals, the relatively high concentrations of bioavailable Cd and Cu resulted from the relatively high Cd (F2) and Cu (F2) in the > 2 mm aggregates indicated contribution of carbonates to soil aggregation and metal adsorption in tidal mud flat.Soil type and aggregate distribution were important factors controlling heavy metal concentration and fractionation in YRD wetland soil. Compared with mud soil, normal soil contained increased concentrations of F5 and F3 of metals in the 0.053-0.25 mm aggregate, and sandy soil contained increased concentrations of bioavailable and total Cr, Ni, and Zn with great contribution of mass loadings in the < 0.053 mm aggregate.

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms.

Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora.

As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest.

In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.",10.5194/bg-13-6565-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006367236&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6565-2016&partnerID=40&md5=d57a008abcef0f9470eec299deab60ff,Liu_2016_90074967,"Liu, Yalong; Wang, Ping; Ding, Yuanjun; Lu, Haifei; Li, Lianqing; Cheng, Kun; Zheng, Jufeng; Filley, Timothy; Zhang, Xuhui; Zheng, Jinwei; Pan, Genxing"

Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation.

Our results showed that the relative denitrification index (RDI) increased gradually with incubation time, and showed a rapid increase in the first 5 days of incubation. The RDI values declined quickly from surface soils to subsurface soils and then kept a small change in deeper soils along soil profiles over the incubation time. Denitrification proceeded much faster in the top 20 cm soils of open wetland than in the closed wetland, whereas no significant differences in RDI values were observed in deeper soils between both wetlands. The RDIs were significantly negatively correlated with bulk density and sand content, while a significantly positive correlation with clay content, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous.

Native (Suaeda salsa) and invasive (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes were selected to study the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and stocks in the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that the SOC contents (g/kg) and stocks (kg/m(2)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years, especially for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The SOC contents exhibited an even distribution along the soil profiles in native salt marshes, while the SOC contents were gradually decreased with depth after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years. The natural ln response ratios (LnRR) were applied to identify the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on the SOC stocks. We also found that Spartina alterniflora invasion might cause soil organic carbon losses in a short-term phase (2-4 years in this study) due to the negative LnRR values, especially for 20-60 cm depth. And the SOCD in surface layer (0-20 cm) do not increase linearly with the invasive age.

JOUR,90074430,2015,NA," Zhao, Bin",author_04,Reclamation of coastal salt marshes promoted carbon loss from previously-sequestered soil carbon pool,"Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of 'blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)).

We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition.

However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC.

S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora.

Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption.

Although the mean TP content in soil profiles was slightly higher in spring (635.7 mg/kg) than that in fall (628.0 mg/kg), the mean TP stock was obviously lower in spring (959.9 g/m(2)) with an obvious accumulation at the 60-80 cm soil depth compared to fall (1124.6 g/m(2)). Topsoil concentration factors also indicated that TP and AP had shallower distribution in soil profiles.

The results showed that the exponential function fits the depth distribution of the SOCv more well than other two functions. The SOCc can be fitted very well by all three functions for three salt marsh (Adj. R-2 > 0.99), of which the allometric function was the best one. The mean topsoil concentration factors (TCFs) of three salt marshes were beyond 0.1, which means the SOC enrichment in surface soils due to plant cycling, but TCFs in PSM were significantly higher than those in SSM (P < 0.05). Nearly 30% of SOC was concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.",10.1038/srep34835,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990817882&doi=10.1038%2fsrep34835&partnerID=40&md5=24912372ff0e19e750b300a353200145,Bai_2016_90075381,"Bai, Junhong; Zhang, Guangliang; Zhao, Qingqing; Lu, Qiongqiong; Jia, Jia; Cui, Baoshan; Liu, Xinhui"

Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion.

Our results showed that there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils among the five sampling sites (p > 0.05), whereas significant differences were observed between June and other months (p < 0.05) following the order June > August > November > April. Generally, available phosphorus (AP) contents also showed a fluctuation in different sampling periods and there were significant differences between November and August and April at 10-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). The soil P supply was generally lower with lower AP:TP ratios less than 2%. Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter.

Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes. Our study indicates that instead of CO2 being simply incorporated into PCS and SCS, carbon dynamics following Spartina invasion are more complicated. Detailed studies of CH4 emissions are needed before ascertaining whether, and to what degree, the invasion of S. alterniflora may affect the global warming process.",10.1002/clen.201300839,NA,Zhou_2015_90074569,"Zhou, Changfang; Zhao, Hui; Sun, Zhiyi; Zhou, Luxian; Fang, Chao; Xiao, Yan; Deng, Zifa; Zhi, Yingbiao; Zhao, Yongqiang; An, Shuqing"

In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of C, N and S of both soil and (native and invasive) plants in four typical coastal wetlands in the core area of the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The results show that the invasive S. alterniflora greatly influenced soil properties and increased soil C, N and S storage capacity: the stock (mean +/- standard error) of soil organic carbon (SOC, (3.56 +/- 0.36) kg/m(3)), total nitrogen (TN, (0.43 +/- 0.02) kg/m(3)), and total sulfur (TS, (0.69 +/- 0.11) kg/m(3)) in the S. alterniflora marsh exceeded those in the adjacent bare mudflat, Suaeda salsa marsh, and Phragmites australis marsh. Because of its greater biomass, plant C ((1193.7 +/- 133.6) g/m(2)), N ((18.8 +/- 2.4) g/m(2)), and S ((9.4 +/- 1.5) g/m(2)) storage of S. alterniflora was also larger than those of co-occurring native plants. More biogenic elements circulated in the soil-plant system of the S. alterniflora marsh, and their spatial and temporal distribution patterns were also changed by the S. alterniflora invasion. Soil properties changed by S. alterniflora's invasion thereby indirectly affected the accumulation of soil C, N and S in this wetland ecosystem. The SOC, TN, and TS contents were positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and moisture, but negatively correlated with the pH and bulk density of soil.

TRIS concentrations in Spartina sediments ranged from 21.7 +/- 11.2 mu mol.cm(-3) to 3.0 +/- 2.0 mu mol.cm(-3). Within the TRIS pool, elemental sulfur (ES) constituted the lowest fraction (3.6% to 31.4%) and chromium reduced sulfur (CRS) and acid volatile sulfur (AVS) fractions were higher particularly at coasts characterized by siltation, ranging from 29.9% to 62.2% and from 28% to 59%, respectively. AVS or CRS contents correlated positively with dissolved iron/SO42- and pH, while no clear relationship was present between the TRIS fractions and the abundance of sulfate reduction genes or between the TRIS fractions and TOC. Massive pyrite was the dominant authigenic pyrite present at all sites.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms.

Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora.

Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)).

High n-DAMO microbial activity was observed, which varied between 0.2 and 84.3 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-)1 for nitrite-DAMO bacteria and between 0.4 and 32.6 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry sediment day(-1) for nitrate-DAMO archaea. The total n-DAMO potential tended to be higher in the warm season and in the upstream freshwater and low-salinity estuarine habitats and was significantly related to sediment pH, total organic carbon, Fe(II), and Fe(III) contents (P<0.05). In addition to acting as an important methane (CH4) sink, n-DAMO microbes had the potential to consume a substantial amount of reactive N in estuarine and intertidal environments, with estimated nitrogen elimination rates of 0.5-224.7 nmol N g(-1) dry sediment day(-1). Overall, our investigation reveals the distribution pattern and controlling factors of n-DAMO bioprocesses in estuarine and intertidal marshes and gains a better understanding of the coupling mechanisms between carbon and nitrogen cycles.

However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling.

Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Yancheng tidal marsh to stabilize the sediments and gradually replaced the native plants. However, the changes in the soil bacterial community profile caused by S. alterniflora invasion are poorly characterized. Here, we used MiSeq sequencing to compare the composition of the bacterial community in soil at different depths under exotic S. alterniflora (SA), native Phragmites australis (PA), and native Suaeda salsa (SS). The results showed that the pH value was lower, but the salinity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and number of 16S rRNA genes were higher in SA soils than in PA and SS soils. Overall, Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae. Anaerolineae in the Chloroflexi phylum showed the greatest difference based on vegetation, accounting for 14.4% of the overall bacterial community in SA soils but only about 3.8% of those in PA and SS soils. The composition, interaction, and predicted functional profiles of the bacterial community in SA soils were significantly different from those in PA and SS soils, especially for functions related to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Salinity was negatively correlated with the Shannon index and accounted for 37.7% of the total variation in the bacterial community, making it the most important environmental factor.

Aerobic methanotrophs in coastal marsh soils are important methane consumers, but their activity and populations are poorly characterized. DNA stable-isotope probing followed by sequencing was used to determine how active methanotrophic populations differed in the main habitats of a Chinese coastal marsh. These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50-70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a significant correlation between the active bacterial communities and soil properties (salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and available phosphorus).

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties.

JOUR,90074575,2021,NA," Zhuang, Ping",author_08,Lateral detrital C transfer across a Spartina alterniflora invaded estuarine wetland,"Background The lateral movements of mass and energy across the terrestrial-aquatic interface are being increasingly recognized for their importance in the carbon (C) balance of coastal/estuarine wetlands. We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.",10.1186/s13717-021-00340-2,NA,Gao_2021_90074575,"Gao, Yu; Chen, Jiquan; Zhang, Tingting; Zhao, Bin; McNulty, Steven; Guo, Haiqiang; Zhao, Feng; Zhuang, Ping"

However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle.

The increased topographic relief associated with the creekbank region is thought to control the unique chemistry and productivity found there. This study was designed to examine the role that tidal creeks play-during the natural development of a barrier island Spartina alterniflora marsh ecosystem on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA. A salt marsh chronosequence, resulting from a 1962 overwash event, was used as a 'space-for-time' substitution in order to define the changes that take place within this marsh over a successional time scale. The chronosequence of marshes is largely attributed to the variation in elevation across the overwash platform: younger marshes are higher relative to sea level. We used a principal components analysis on a suite of physico-chemical and biological variables. A single principle component explained 53% of the variability in the data and is used to describe the functional trajectory along which these marshes develop. This component is associated with an increase in sediment organic matter and nitrogen content (%N), porewater nutrients, S. alterniflora height, weight, %flowering and %N, and a decrease in grain size and redox potential. The factor scores from this analysis, which were used as a proxy for the functional maturity of the marsh, increased from creek edge to interior marsh for young marsh sites. Thus, the marsh nearest the creek most resembles the mature marsh. The temporal patterns of creek-water physico-chemistry vary between different aged creeks, suggesting that due to their small size and shallow depth younger creeks act to retain nutrients and particulates within the marsh. The hydrological, chemical and biological processes within the creeks themselves and at the creekbank are important in controlling the overall rate of marsh development. While creeks act to accelerate the rate of maturation, our results also indicate that not all marshes follow the same developmental trajectory and that the regional landscape may be a more important factor. With the increased interest in marsh restoration and creation for the mitigation of coastal wetland loss, there is a need for a greater functional understanding of the factors that control marsh development. The results of this study suggest that increasing creek frontage will increase the rate at which created marshes achieve functional equivalence with mature marshes.",10.3354/meps180161,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033519406&doi=10.3354%2fmeps180161&partnerID=40&md5=688d23f231d8b686870f6f96b3aa304e,Tyler_1999_90075312,"Tyler, A.C.; Zieman, J.C."

Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153359,NA,Abbott_1800_90074586,"Abbott, Katherine M; Quirk, Tracy; Fultz, Lisa M"
JOUR,90075221,2019,NA,"Abbott, Katherine M",author_01,Dataset: Factors influencing blue carbon accumulation across a 32‐year chronosequence of created coastal marshes,"Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from 12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 , which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.",10.1007/s11356-012-1336-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878113006&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-012-1336-8&partnerID=40&md5=f8246c1cf89f6b2c562d1c93d66c72c6,Anjum_2013_90074768,"Anjum, Naser A.; Ahmad, Iqbal; Valega, Monica; Figueira, Etelvina; Duarte, Armando C.; Pereira, Eduarda"

Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon.

Our results showed that the relative denitrification index (RDI) increased gradually with incubation time, and showed a rapid increase in the first 5 days of incubation. The RDI values declined quickly from surface soils to subsurface soils and then kept a small change in deeper soils along soil profiles over the incubation time. Denitrification proceeded much faster in the top 20 cm soils of open wetland than in the closed wetland, whereas no significant differences in RDI values were observed in deeper soils between both wetlands. The RDIs were significantly negatively correlated with bulk density and sand content, while a significantly positive correlation with clay content, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous.

Owing to worse natural environment such as drought, water shortage and intense human activities, inland salt marshes were extensively developed in the west Songhuajiang-Nenjiang plain with high ecological frangibility, in which Xianghai wetland is one typical inland salt marsh located downstream of Huolin river basin, Jilin Province of China.

The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), soil pH and soil particle sizes were measured in wetland soils in order to study influencing factors and seasonal dynamics of the life elements in soil profiles from inland salt marsh. Correlation analysis was carried out to show the relationships between SOC, TN, TP, soil pH, clay, silt and sand. Results showed that SOC, TN and TP contents were significantly negatively correlated with depth, and decreased from surface soils down to bottom soil layers in four months; the obvious seasonal dynamics of SOC, TN and TP contents in soil profiles were also observed and the seasonal dynamics of life elements in soil profiles generally showed the consistent changing trends of ""increasing after decreasing"" with the exception of continuous increase of SOC and TN contents in surface soils, There were significantly negative correlations between SOC, TN and TP, which were greatly influenced by soil clay, silt and sand contents; soil pH was significantly negatively correlated with SOC content, but weakly influenced TN and TP contents.

Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption. The findings of this study indicate that freshwater restoration can contribute to controlling the eutrophication status of water bodies through increasing P sorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Trace elements did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in T. chinensis wetland.

Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils.

Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes.

Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes.

Salt marsh deposits on a typical temperate backbarrier saltmarsh area at the Skallingen barrierspit (Denmark) were investigated for autochthonous or below ground organic production, which was found to have a mean value of 0.14 kg m(-2) y(-1) or about 0.1 mm y(-1). This production is concentrated in the upper approximately 5 cm of the salt marsh. Below this level the organic material decomposes with a decreasing organic content until about 15 cm below the surface. Hereunder the decomposition of organic material seems to stabilize at a very low level. The constant rate of the below ground organic production results in a larger concentration of this type of organic matter in the slowest accreting salt marsh deposits. The root activity is the primary reason for differences in the bulk dry density of salt marsh surface layers, therefore the surface layers of slowly accreting salt marshes have the lowest bulk dry density. During autocompaction, the bulk dry density increases down core. This process is only to a small degree (<10%) directly affected by the space loss due to decomposition of organic matter. The decay of organic matter, however, is most likely indirectly part of the autocompaction process by weakening the internal strength of the root fabric and thus the capability of resistance against compaction from the overburden of depositing sediments.

Coastal Louisiana marshes have been historically classified as fresh, intermediate, brackish, or saline based on resident plant community and position along a salinity gradient. Short-term total carbon accumulation rates were assessed by collecting 10-cm deep soil cores at 24 sites located in marshes spanning the salinity gradient. Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates. Based on both analyses, the coastal Louisiana total marsh area (1,433,700 ha) accumulates about 2.7 to 3.3 Tg C year(-1).

Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr(-1), a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget.",10.1029/2020JG005832,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103233334&doi=10.1029%2f2020JG005832&partnerID=40&md5=a5c25433c8600e05926f5a73870de7ad,Baustian_2021_90075292,"Baustian, Melissa M.; Stagg, Camille L.; Perry, Carey L.; Moss, Leland C.; Carruthers, Tim J.

Aellen,"This paper deals with the organic matter dynamics of a dwarf shrub species, Atriplex portulacoides, which characterizes the majority of ungrazed European salt marshes. These dynamics were investigated by the simultaneous estimation of primary production, litter production, decomposition processes and accumulation of organic matter in sediment. We used harvested biomass techniques and the litter-bag method, as well as more recent techniques such as determination of natural isotopic compositions. The results of this study have been compared with those of other studies of salt marshes of the Eastern Coast of America dominated by Spartina alterniflora.Studies of the fate of halophytic organic matter in salt marshes have shown that processes such as consumption, decomposition, or flooding rapidly could distribute organic material to different compartments of the marsh system. Aboveground productivity of A. portulacoides was 1700 g m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 80% of this production was transformed rapidly in necromass. A large part of this dead material (86%) fell as litter directly onto the sediment at the sampling site. The remainder was washed away by tides, either out of the marsh, or into the upper marsh where it accumulated in drift lines. Decomposition of A. portulacoides on the sediment was followed using litter-bags. Decay constants, based on the first order decay function, ranged between 0.0404 d(-1) and 0.0113 d(-1) and appeared high when compare with data obtained in other American and European salt marshes. Nitrogen immobilisation was not detectable in this decomposition experiment. During decay, nitrogen concentrations increased, whereas absolute amount of nitrogen decreased. After microbial decomposition, plant detritus was rapidly incorporated into sediment. The carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment showed that organic matter in the middle marsh came from both aboveground production of A. portulacoides and microalgae. The patterns for these two kinds of organic matter in different granulometric fractions depended on tidal submersion frequency. During the summer, when the salt marsh was not disturbed by tides, the clay fraction got richer in plant organic matter, whereas, during the other periods, this fraction was characterized by microalgal organic matter.This study provides new data about the dynamic of organic matter. It remains still difficult to establish comparisons between North American and European salt marsh functioning according to the variability of primary production, microbial decomposition and tidal range in these ecosystems.",10.1007/978-94-011-5266-2_6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031693383&doi=10.1007%2f978-94-011-5266-2_6&partnerID=40&md5=bf92354cc591181849b3cdde8bb0d204,Bouchard_1998_90074359,"Bouchard, V.; Creach, V.; Lefeuvre, J.

JOUR,90074545,2000, Europe,"Bouchard, V.",author_01,Primary production and macro-detritus dynamics in a European salt marsh: carbon and nitrogen budgets,"Primary production and the detritus pathway (i.e., detritus production, litter fall, export to coastal waters, and decomposition) were studied over a I-year period in three salt marsh levels (low, middle and high marshes). Carbon and nitrogen content in biomass and macro-detritus were estimated at each step of the detrital pathway. Several lines of evidence suggested that low, middle and high marshes had different properties which affected their interaction with adjoining waters. More than species diversity, the salt marsh zonation across a 1.8 km transect resulted in a spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of organic matter and nutrients within the salt marsh. The low marsh was the less productive level (1080 g dry weight m-(2) per year) and was a source of organic matter for the two other marsh levels. Almost 89% of the organic matter produced in the low marsh was flushed away by the tide and redistributed inside the marsh, whereas the remainder decomposed quickly (0.023 per day) at the production site. The export of macro-detritus to coastal waters was probably insignificant to the carbon and nitrogen balance of the salt marsh. In the middle and high marshes, most of the production fell as litter directly at the production site. In the high marsh, vegetation stands were very productive (1990 g dry weight m(-2) per year) and litter decomposed slowly (0.0047 per day), The middle marsh was as productive as the high marsh (1910 g dry weight m(-2) per day), but the decay rate (0.028 per day) was similar to that estimated for the low marsh. This study demonstrates that the mineralization of halophyte-derived organic matter takes place almost completely within the marsh itself. Data on carbon and nitrogen decay indicated that only a small part of the high marsh production was rapidly available to fuel food webs of the ecosystem or to be exported to coastal waters. In contrast, the high amount of biomass produced in the middle marsh was rapidly available for food webs, Export of organic matter may be controlled by macro-detritus production (amount and timing), intensity and time distribution of tide events, and, mostly, decay rates. Because for most of the year the marsh is exposed to the atmosphere, we suggest that exchanges of gaseous carbon and nitrogen with the atmosphere should be investigated.

Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher.

The rate of mineral matter accumulation was higher in both reference marshes, but was significantly higher in only one. Spatial variability in accumulation rates was low when analyzed in one managed marsh site, suggesting a primarily autochthonous source of matter. In contrast, the associated reference marsh apparently received allochthonous material that settled out in a distinct spatial pattern as water velocity decreased. The impoundment marshes experienced an accretion deficit of one full order of magnitude (0.1 vs. 1.0 cm/yr) based on comparison of accretion and sea level rise data, while the unmanaged reference marshes experienced a five-fold smaller deficit or no deficit.

TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils.

Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

Accretion rates are compared to a number of factors assumed to influence vertical marsh accretion: rates of relative sea-level rise, climatic parameters (average daily temperatures and degree days) and latitude (related to insolation and day length), sediment characteristics (organic matter inventory, bulk, mineral, and organic matter density), distance of the core site from the nearest source of tidal waters, and the tidal range. Unique to our study is a consideration of climatic parameters and latitude, which should influence organic matter production, and thus vertical accretion rates. Significant predictors of accretion rates (in order of importance) were found to be organic matter inventory, distance from a creek, and range of mean tides. Contrary to conclusions from previous studies, we found that accretion rates decreased with increasing tidal range, probably because we considered a wider span of tidal ranges, from micro- to macrotidal. Although four marshes with low organic matter inventories also show a deficit in accretion with respect to relative sea-level rise, organic matter is not limiting in two-thirds of the marshes studied, despite shorter growing seasons.",10.1007/BF02803561,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2142813967&doi=10.1007%2fBF02803561&partnerID=40&md5=56f6690286422577c1c7b54b3f5430d3,Chmura_2004_90074854,"Chmura, G.L.; Hung, G.A."

A field survey was performed based on a plot sampling design. The results provided by the analyses of rhizospheric soil (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, total nitrogen, etc.) and metal(loid)s' phytoavailability (assessed by EDTA) were discussed and related to plant metal uptake. The averages of pH and EC values of the bulk soil and rhizospheric samples were in the range of neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7-8) to saline (> 2 dS m(-1)), respectively. Heavy metal and As concentrations (e.g. similar to 600 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, similar to 11,000 mg kg(-1) Pb) were higher in the rhizosphere for both total and EDTA-extractable fraction. Phragmites australis uptaked the highest concentrations in roots (e.g. similar to 66 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 1,770 mg kg(-1) Zn) but not in shoots, for which most of plant species showed low values for Zn (< 300 mg kg(-1)) but not for Cd (> 0.5 mg kg(-1)) or Pb (similar to 20-40 mg kg(-1)). Vegetation distribution in the studied salt marsh looked to be more affected by salinity than by metal pollution. The free availability of water for plants and the incoming nutrient-enriched effluents which flow through the salt marsh may have hindered the metal(loid)s' phytotoxicity.

We performed a field study following a plot sampling survey. The analyses of soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon contents, etc.), total metal and As concentrations and their phytoavailability assessed with EDTA were related to each microenvironment and the corresponding plant species uptake. The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. However the highest metal and As shoot concentrations occurred in species from the Sand Dunes: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As similar to 270 mg kg(-1) Pb for Dittrichia viscosa: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 390 mg kg(-1) Zn for Crucianella maritima. The occurrence of edaphic gradients including salinity and texture determined the vegetation distribution. However, it cannot be concluded that there was a disturbance due to metal(loid)s soil concentrations in terms of vegetation composition except in the Degraded Dunes and Dry River. The higher EDTA-extractable concentrations were coincidental with the most saline soils but this did not result in higher metal(loid)s plant accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114035745&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2021.120503&partnerID=40&md5=a10c600910c714f7cee95362bb10ec77,Costa_2021_90074624,"Costa, Larissa; Johannesson, Karen; Mirlean, Nicolai; Quintana, Guilherme"

Sediment cores (ca. 60 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in As content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominated). Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores.

This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the ""MIRACLE"" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some ""memory"" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg ""trapped"" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

JOUR,90075171,2017, Europe (rare),"Covelli, Stefano",author_01,Historical sedimentary trends of mercury and other trace elements from two saltmarshes of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea),"Purpose Previous research conducted in the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea) has shown that this environment has been affected by trace metal contamination, especially by mercury (Hg), from both industrial (the chlor-alkali plant) and mining activities (Idrija mine, Slovenia). Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg.

On many sites, restoration of ecological attributes such as secondary production, habitat/species diversity, and wetland soil characteristics do not occur within the first decade, and no long-term studies exist to document the length of time required to achieve complete restoration of wetland dependent functions and values. Characteristics of community structure (macrophyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15-25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12-24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7-12 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) than in natural marshes (2-5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems.

JOUR,90074688,2002,NA,"Craft, C.",author_01,Fifteen years of vegetation and soil development after brackish-water marsh creation,"Aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter (MOM), and wetland soil characteristics were measured periodically between 1983 and 1998 in a created brackish-water marsh and a nearby natural marsh along the Pamlico River estuary, North Carolina to evaluate the development of wetland vegetation and soil dependent functions after marsh creation. Development of aboveground biomass and MOM was dependent on elevation and frequency of tidal inundation. Aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora , which occupied low elevations along tidal creeks and was inundated frequently, developed to levels similar to the natural marsh (750 to 1,300 g/m(2) ) within three years after creation. Spartina cynosuroides , which dominated interior areas of the marsh and was flooded less frequently, required 9 years to consistently achieve aboveground biomass equivalent to the natural marsh (600 to 1,560 g/m(2) ). Aboveground biomass of Spartina patens , which was planted at the highest elevations along the terrestrial margin and seldom flooded, never consistently developed aboveground biomass comparable with the natural marsh during the 15 years after marsh creation. MOM (0 to 10 cm) generally developed at the same rate as aboveground biomass. Between 1988 and 1998, soil bulk density decreased and porosity and organic C and N pools increased in the created marsh. Like vegetation, wetland soil development proceeded faster in response to increased inundation, especially in the streamside zone dominated by S. alterniflora. We estimated that in the streamside and interior zones, an additional 30 years (nitrogen) to 90 years (organic C, porosity) are needed for the upper 30 cm of created marsh soil to become equivalent to the natural marsh. Wetland soil characteristics of the S. patens community along upland fringe will take longer to develop, more than 200 years. Development of the benthic invertebrate-based food web, which depends on organic matter enrichment of the upper 5 to 10 cm of soil, is expected to take less time. Wetland soil characteristics and functions of created irregularly flooded brackish marshes require longer to develop compared with regularly flooded salt marshes because reduced tidal inundation slows wetland vegetation and soil development. The hydrologic regime (regularly vs. irregularly flooded) of the ""target"" wetland should be considered when setting realistic expectations for success criteria of created and restored wetlands.",10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.01020.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036087556&doi=10.1046%2fj.1526-100X.2002.01020.x&partnerID=40&md5=3a38d4e3004b2f985425a40faa65d1ec,Craft_2002_90074688,"Craft, C.; Broome, S.; Campbell, C."

Infauna density and species richness (per 7.07 cm(2) core) achieved equivalence to comparable reference marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Taxa with dispersing larval stages (e.g. Streblospio benedicti, Capitella sp.) achieved equivalence within 3 yr following marsh creation. Taxa that lack a planktonic dispersal stage, such as tubificid oligochaetes and Manayunkia aesturina, were slower to develop. Densities of Manayunkia did not achieve equivalence to natural marshes until 8 yr after marsh creation. Twenty-five yr elapsed before oligochaete densities of constructed marshes were similar to natural marshes. In constructed marshes, densities of surface-deposit feeders, dominated by Streblospio and Manayunkia, achieved equivalence to natural marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Subsurface-deposit feeders, consisting mostly of oligochaetes, did not become equivalent to natural marshes for 25 yr. Predictable trajectories, described by an asymptotic increase over time, existed for total species, species richness, and surface- and subsurface-deposit feeders. Oligochaetes and Manayunkia, which produce non-dispersing larvae, exhibited linear trajectories over time. In constructed marshes, total density and density of dominant taxa and trophic groups were strongly correlated with soil characteristics, especially organic C, N, bulk density and macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat). Non-linear regressions using soil organic C and MOM explained 38 to 40% of the variation in constructed marsh infauna density. The regressions suggest that a threshold of 0.5% soil organic C (500 g m(-2), 0 to 10 cm) and 500 g MOM m(-2) (0 to 10 cm) is needed to support infauna densities comparable to densities found in natural marshes. Taxon richness of constructed marshes was more strongly related to vegetation characteristics, especially macro-organic matter quality (e.g. lignin) than soil characteristics.

A combination of measurements from different-age created marshes as well as periodic measurements over time on two marshes were used to (1) document rates of wetland pedogenesis, especially soil organic matter, and, (2) explore relationships between soil and benthic invertebrate community development. Soil macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat), organic C and N increased and bulk density decreased during the 25 years following marsh establishment. The most dramatic changes in bulk density, MOM, C and N occurred within the upper 10 cm of the soil with lesser changes below this depth. Created marshes were sinks for organic C (90-140 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) and N (7-11 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) but not for P (0-1 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1). The density of benthic invertebrates (>250 mum) and subsurface-deposit feeding oligochaetes also increased over time on created salt marshes. Invertebrate and oligochaete density were strongly related to MOM content (r2 = 0.83-0.87) and soil organic C (r2 = 0.52-0.82) and N (r2 = 0.62-0.84).

Attributes related to biological productivity and diversity (Spartina, epiphytic and sediment algae, benthic invertebrates), soil development (sediment deposition, organic C, N, P, organic matter quality), and microbial processes (C mineralization) were compared among eight constructed marshes and eight paired natural reference marshes. Most ecological attributes developed in a predictable manner over time, and most achieved equivalence to natural marshes 5-15 yr after marsh construction. An exception was soil organic C and N pools (0-30 cm) that, after 28 yr, were significantly lower in constructed marshes. Development of habitat structure (Spartina stem height and density) and biodiversity (algae and invertebrates) developed concurrently with functional characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll a, and invertebrate density. Processes related to hydrology, sediment deposition and soil C and N accumulation, developed almost instantaneously with the establishment of Spartina, and young (1- to 3-yr-old), constructed marshes trapped sediment and sequestered N at higher rates than comparable reference marshes. Development of heterotrophic activity (C mineralization, invertebrate density) was strongly linked to surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C content.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f,Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927,"Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

This study analyzed the environment and the macroinvertebrate community in European salt marshes 3 years after restoration using Spartina maritima plantations in comparison with non-restored and preserved marshes in Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community.

Our primary objectives were to quantify carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and sequestration rates in restored marshes dominated by Spartina maritima to provide support for restoration and management strategies that may offset negative aspects of eutrophication and climate change in estuarine ecosystems. Sediment C content was between ca. 13 mg C g(-1)and sediment N content was ca. 1.8 mg N g(-1). The highest C content for S. maritima was recorded in leaves and stems (ca. 420 mg C g(-1)) and the lowest in roots (361 +/- 4 mg C g(-1)). S. maritima also concentrated more N in its leaves (31 +/- 1 mg N g(-1)) than in other organs. C stock in the restored marshes was 29.6 t C ha(-1); ca. 16 % was stored in S. maritima tissues. N stock was 3.6 t N ha(-1), with 8.3 % stored in S. maritima. Our results showed that the S. maritima restored marshes, 2.5 years after planting, were sequestering atmospheric C and, therefore, provide some mitigation for global warming. Stands are also capturing nitrogen and reducing eutrophication. The concentrations of C and N contents in sediments, and cordgrass relative cover of 62 %, and low below-ground biomass (BGB) suggest restored marshes can sequester more C and N.

Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1).

In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to quantify carbon sources in a restoring, sparsely vegetated marsh (Restoring) and an adjacent, historically unaltered marsh (Reference) in the Nisqually River Delta (NRD) of Washington, USA. Three sediment cores were collected at ""Inland"" and ""Seaward"" locations at both marshes similar to 6 years after restoration. Benthic diatoms, C3 plants, C4 plants, and particulate organic matter (POM) were collected throughout the NRD. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of sources and sediments were used in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to determine the contribution of each carbon source to the sediments of both marshes. Autochthonous marsh C3 plants contributed 73 +/- 10% (98 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 89 +/- 11% (119 g C m(-2) year(-1)) to Reference-Inland and Reference-Seaward sediment carbon sinks, respectively. In contrast, the sediment carbon sink at the Restoring Marsh received a broad assortment of predominantly allochthonous materials, which varied in relative contribution based on source distance and abundance. Marsh POM contributed the most to Restoring-Seaward (42 +/- 34%) (69 g C m(-2) year(-1)) followed by Riverine POM at Restoring-Inland (32 +/- 41%) (52 g C m(-2) year(-1)).

The aim of this study is to correlate the distribution patterns of living (stained) benthic foraminifera with environmental variables such as tidal elevation, interstitial pore water salinity. organic matter content of the sediment, pheopigments. chlorophyll a, carbonate contents and grain size distribution of the sediment from 86 samples collected in the Aiguillon cove (France).

Organic matter also influences the distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera: the relative abundance of Ammonia tepida is typically favored by all increase of total organic matter food resources.

This study is carried out on 15 samples regularly spaced from the mudflat to the tidal marsh. The results indicate that grain size is the most limiting parameter.

Both organic-bound and residual fractions were always dominant, being the seasonal variations due to interchanges between these two fractions. Phenol oxidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase had higher activities during the Spring and Summer, contrarily to peroxidase which had higher activity during Winter. Protease showed high activities in both Spring and Winter. These different periods of high organic matter hydrolysis caused two periods of organic metal bound decrease.

For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90075486,2014, Europe,"Duarte, Bernardo",author_01,Abiotic control modelling of salt marsh sediments respiratory CO 2 fluxes: Application to increasing temperature scenarios,"Sediment microbial communities are responsible for several ecosystem key-processes such as decomposition. However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.",10.5194/bg-15-379-2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040771479&doi=10.5194%2fbg-15-379-2018&partnerID=40&md5=e1cdb8a9dc523eb908d0a9ab98583c97,Elsey-Quirk_2018_90074782,"Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Unger, Viktoria"

The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas.

Ditching was largely abandoned by the mid-twentieth century; however, techniques that create permanent shallow water pools for mosquito control and bird habitat are increasingly being applied to marshes of the USA and elsewhere. Salt marshes in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were used to examine differences between areas that have been ditched and those altered to increase the density of shallow pools in water table dynamics, salinity, soil and porewater chemistry, as well as short-term sedimentation, accretion, and elevation change rates. We found that the area with plugged ditches, berms, and pools in Plum Island had less drainage, higher salinity and porewater sulfide and ammonium concentrations, and higher soil organic matter than the adjacent ditched area. Despite averaging 8 cm lower in elevation, the Plum Island ditched area had less sediment deposition and was composed of higher elevation plant species than the area with plugged ditches, berms, and shallow pools. Elevation increased in the ditched area at a rate of 3.2 +/- A 0.5 mm/year, but elevation change was variable in the area with pools. In Barnegat Bay, the marsh area with pools and ditches had less sediment deposition and surface accretion than the ditch-only area, associated, in part, with the higher elevation. An average elevation difference of 4.5 cm was associated with a sixfold difference in mineral sediment deposition. Temporal sediment deposition and surface accretion was important in the ditch-only area but was absent or muted in the area with numerous pools. Elevation increased in both marsh areas at an average rate of 1.8 +/- A 0.8 mm/year, less than half the long-term average local rate of sea-level rise.

In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon.

S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced.

The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes.

Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.",10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a,Ferreira_2013_90074595,"Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries.

Within a salt marsh area along the Canche Estuary (northern France), four transects were sampled to see the effects of maximal tidal constraints (shore transects) and minimal tidal constraints (alongshore transects). Multivariate analyses have been performed to determine the correlations between biotic (foraminiferal absolute abundances) and abiotic factors (elevation, grain-size, TOC and total sulphur). For each of the principal benthic foraminiferal species the tolerance to subaerial exposure have been estimated as well. Two distinctive foraminiferal zones have been identified along the vertical tidal gradient: a zone I in the higher part of the salt marsh dominated by agglutinated and porcelaneous taxa, and a zone II in the lower one dominated by hyaline specimens. Hyper tidal exposure constraints the foraminiferal vertical zonation in accordance with the tidal frame. However it does not constitute a threshold parameter able by itself to explain all the faunal variations in the Canche Estuary. For sea level indicators, foraminifera should be considered relative to tidal subaerial exposure rather than to absolute altitude. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90074575,2021,NA,"Gao, Yu",author_01,Lateral detrital C transfer across a Spartina alterniflora invaded estuarine wetland,"Background The lateral movements of mass and energy across the terrestrial-aquatic interface are being increasingly recognized for their importance in the carbon (C) balance of coastal/estuarine wetlands. We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.",10.1186/s13717-021-00340-2,NA,Gao_2021_90074575,"Gao, Yu; Chen, Jiquan; Zhang, Tingting; Zhao, Bin; McNulty, Steven; Guo, Haiqiang; Zhao, Feng; Zhuang, Ping"

However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.",10.1029/2019JG005459,NA,Gao_2020_90074889,"Gao, Yu; Peng, Rong-Hao; Ouyang, Zu-Tao; Shao, Chang-Liang; Chen, Ji-Quan; Zhang, Ting-Ting; Guo, Hai-Qiang; Tang, Jian-Wu; Zhao, Feng; Zhuang, Ping; Zhao, Bin"
JOUR,90074349,2020,NA,"Ge, Baoming",author_01,Succession of macrofaunal communities and environmental properties along a gradient of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora invasion stages,"The exotic species smooth cordgrass (Spartina alternifiora) is recognized as an important invasive species in China, introduced about 40 years ago. The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis. The succession of macrofaunal communities should be considered as a comprehensive response to the variations on environmental properties co-varying with smooth cordgrass invasion in coastal wetlands.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104862,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076841752&doi=10.1016%2fj.marenvres.2019.104862&partnerID=40&md5=b68bd776d73c044d9ca74bcd2e67c4d1,Ge_2020_90074349,"Ge, Baoming; Jiang, Senhao; Yang, Li; Zhang, Huabin; Tang, Boping"

Invasion of S. alterniflora altered the environmental properties. With the increase of invasion age, the coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content tended to increase, whereas chlorophyll a and salinity tended to decrease. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the habitats were separated along the gradient of the invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and salinity were the most important characters for habitat differentiation because the PCA biplot illustrated that the vectors of these environmental properties involved the smaller angles with PC 1. Based on a two-way ANOVA analysis, invasion stage of S. alterniflora and season significantly affected the density of A. latericea (p < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (p = 0. 226). The density of A. latericea varied significantly among seasons in each habitat based on a one-way ANOVA analysis, except in the bare mudflat without invasion. The highest densities occurred at the mature invasion stage in autumn, whereas the lowest densities occurred with no invasion in spring. Both Taylor's and Iwao's regressions indicated that A. latericea presented an aggregated distribution pattern (p < 0.001). The consistent distribution pattern indicated that it might be a biological trait of the species. Based on stepwise regression analysis, stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content were selected for the optimal regression model. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion altered the environment of the coast and variation in A. latericea density was a response of the species to the environmental change caused by S. alterniflora invasion.

Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization.

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink.

Several locations along the estuary salinity gradient were sampled during four different periods of contrasting river discharge and tidal ranee. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters ranged from 7 mg l(-1) in the lower bay stations closest to the ocean to 20 mg l(-1) in the river and upper bay samples. There was a general linear relationship between DOC concentrations and salinity in three of the four sampling periods. In contrast, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were significantly lower (0.1-3 mg l(-1)) and showed no relationship with salinity. The high molecular weight dissolved OM (HMW DOM) isolated from selected water samples collected along the bay displayed atomic carbon: nitrogen ratios ([C/N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic carbon (delta(13)C(OC)) that ranged from 10 to 30 and from -28 to -25parts per thousand, respectively. Combined, such compositions indicate that in most HMW DOM samples, the majority of the OM originates from terrigenous sources, with smaller contributions from riverine and estuarine phytoplankton. In contrast, the [C/N]a ratios of particulate OM (POM) samples varied significantly among the collection periods, ranging from low values of similar to5 to high values of >20. Overall, the trends in [C/N]a ratios indicated that algal sources of POM were most important during the early and late summer, whereas terrigenous sources dominated in the winter and early spring.In Winyah Bay bottom sediments, the concentrations of the mineral-associated OM were positively correlated with sediment surface area. The [C/N]a ratios and delta(13)C(OC) compositions of the bulk sedimentary OM ranged from 5 to 45 and from -28 to -23parts per thousand, respectively. These compositions were consistent with predominant contributions of terrigenous sources and lesser (but significant) inputs of freshwater, estuarine and marine phytoplankton. The highest terrigenous contents were found in sediments from the river and upper bay sites, with smaller contributions to the lower parts of the estuary. The yields of lignin-derived CuO oxidation products from Winyah Bay sediments indicated that the terrigenous OM in these samples was composed of variable mixtures of relatively fresh vascular plant detritus and moderately altered soil OM. Based on the lignin phenol compositions, most of this material appeared to be derived from angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular plant sources similar to those found in the upland coastal forests in this region. A few samples displayed lignin compositions that suggested a more significant contribution from marsh C-3 grasses.

Elevated nitrogen contents in humus samples suggest nitrogen incorporation during humification is most extensive in forest soils relative to the marsh sites. The lignin compositions of the macro-organic and humus samples reflect the predominant type of vegetation at each site. Lignin phenol ratios indicate that woody and nonwoody litter from gymnosperm and angiosperms trees (pines and oaks) is the major source of vascular plant-derived organic matter in the forest site and that angiosperm grasses (Juncus and Spartina) are the major sources of lignin at the marsh sites. The phenol distributions also reveal that oxidative degradation of Lignin is most extensive in the forest and brackish marsh zones whereas little Lignin decay occurs in the salt marsh samples. In forest soils, most organic matter originates From highly altered forest vegetation while at the brackish marsh site organic matter is a mixture of degraded Juncus materials and microbial/algal remains. Organic matter in the salt marsh appears to be composed of a more complex mixture of sources, including degraded Spartina detritus as well as algal and microbial inputs. Microbial methane oxidation appears to be an important process and a source of C-15 depleted organic carbon in subsurface sediments at this site.",10.2307/1353145,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033801373&doi=10.2307%2f1353145&partnerID=40&md5=f1f9a257b4babaa0f3031107a57cddb8,Goñi_2000_90075267,"Goñi, M.A.; Thomas, K.A."
JOUR,90074871,2012, Europe,"Gonzalez-Alcaraz, M. N.",author_01,"Storage of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil-plant system of Phragmites australis stands from a eutrophicated Mediterranean salt marsh","In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

N.",author_01,Contribution of soil properties to the assessment of a seawater irrigation programme as a management strategy for abandoned solar saltworks,"The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades, but has been little studied on the estuarine portion of the St. Lawrence River. We collected soil cores from Phragmites stand and S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec.

The organic matter content of the ground samples was measured through loss-on-ignition (LOI) with the equation developed by Craft et al. (1991): % organic carbon = 0.40*%LOI + 0.0025(%LOI)2. As much as possible, rhizomes and roots were identified to species using the key of Niering et al. (1977). We used the color and turgor of rhizomes and roots to discern live from dead. Live material is usually light in color and turgid. Dead tissue is dark and flaccid. Unidentified material (mostly roots) was grouped together as other. The volume of each species was determined by placing the entire sample of a species in a graduated cylinder with a known amount of water and measuring the volume of water displaced.

The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.",10.1007/s00442-012-2356-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867501387&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-012-2356-2&partnerID=40&md5=1ad42024ac95f1ab7f473d1a884c9b45,Guo_2012_90075289,"Guo, Hongyu; Pennings, Steven C."

Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored.

We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms.

Such a model should follow classic patterns of soil nutrient pools described for alluvial ecosystems that are dominated by mineral matter high in phosphorus and low in carbon and nitrogen. A contrast with classic models of soil development is the anthropogenically enriched high nitrate conditions due to agricultural fertilization in upstream watersheds. Here we determine if short-term patterns of soil chemistry and dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes along the emerging Wax Lake delta (WLD) chronosequence are consistent with conceptual models of long-term nutrient availability described for other ecosystems. We add a low nitrate treatment more typical of historic delta development to evaluate the role of nitrate enrichment in determining the net dinitrogen (N-2) flux. Throughout the 35-year chronosequence, soil nitrogen and organic matter content significantly increased by an order of magnitude, whereas phosphorus exhibited a less pronounced increase. Under ambient nitrate concentrations (> 60 mu M), mean net N-2 fluxes (157.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) indicated greater rates of gross denitrification than gross nitrogen fixation; however, under low nitrate concentrations (< 2 mu M), soils switched from net denitrification to net nitrogen fixation (-74.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). As soils in the WLD aged, the subsequent increase in organic matter stimulated net N-2, oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite fluxes producing greater fluxes in more mature soils. In conclusion, soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation along an emerging delta chronosequence largely coincide with classic patterns of soil development described for alluvial floodplains, and substrate age together with ambient nitrogen availability can be used to predict net N-2 fluxes during early delta evolution.",10.1007/s10021-013-9727-3,NA,Henry_2014_90074807,"Henry, Kelly M.; Twilley, Robert R."

These expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error [SE]: 0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 %), or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on autochthonous soil development.

Sediment cores from living stands (LS), dead stands (DS), and recently killed stands (RKS) were collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOG), sulfate, chloride, Cr(II)-reducible sulfide, and biomass of roots and rhizomes. Living roots were distributed mainly in the upper 16 cm and concentrated at 4-10 an below the sediment surface. Pyrite accumulations were significantly different among the three types of sediment cores in the upper 16 an sediment and follow the descending order of DS (615 mu mol cm(-3)) > RKS (547 mu mol cm(-3)) > LS (368 mu mol cm(-3)). Between 20 cm and 30 an, pyrite contents approached values of 40 mu mol cm(-3) and 55 mu mol cm(-3) in all sediment cores.

Root distribution also affected the redistribution of iron through iron sulfide formation. Sulfate depletion in the upper 16 cm was higher in RKS (79.3 mu mol cm(-3)) than DS (49.1 mu mol cm(-3)). No significant sulfate depletion was found in LS. Sulfate reduction under DS was likely limited by the readily available substrates.

However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity.

In both marshes, the denitrification rates varied significantly with the season only in loam soil. The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.HighlightsDenitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.",10.1111/ejss.12956,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083381567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12956&partnerID=40&md5=1111fdd770769b6d9af5ca6ed5172cd6,Hu_2021_90075266,"Hu, Minjie; Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi; Huang, Jiafang; Xu, Kang; Tong, Chuan"

Here, we examined the decay of shichito matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively.

Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.",10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862197067&doi=10.1016%2fS1001-0742%2811%2960877-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0b866e9d9b9e7b8a49468ef17b110c7,Hu_2012_90074580,"Hu, Yu; Li, Yanli; Wang, Lei; Tang, Yushu; Chen, Jinhai; Fu, Xiaohua; Le, Yiquan; Wu, Jihua"

Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables.

The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit.

A geological and geomorphological survey was carried out and samples from the mining waste deposits and the marsh were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe content, and soil mineralogical composition. Metals in marsh plants were determined in above-and below -ground structures.

Restored wetland similarity with adjacent natural habitat (age 2 yr at Tijuana Estuary and 6 yr at Mission Bay) depended on habitat type and pigment measure. Restored upper intertidal Succulent marsh at Mission Bay was most divergent: it had lower microalgal biomass, a lower concentration of zeaxanthin relative to fucoxanthin, and less bacteriochlorophyll a relative to chlorophyll a than natural habitat. The results Suggest that patches of prokaryotic primary producers coincide with areas of high sediment organic matter and/or hypoxia superimposed on a broadly distributed flora of diatoms across various wetland landscapes.",10.1672/08-06.1,NA,Janousek_2009_90074499,"Janousek, Christopher N."

We conducted experiments across a latitudinal and climate gradient of tidal marshes in the northeast Pacific to evaluate the effects of climate- and vegetation-related factors on litter decomposition. We manipulated tidal exposure and litter type in experimental mesocosms at two sites and used variation across marsh landscapes at seven sites to test for relationships between decomposition and marsh elevation, soil temperature, vegetation composition, litter quality, and sediment organic content. A greater than tenfold increase in manipulated tidal inundation resulted in small increases in decomposition of roots and rhizomes of two species, but no significant change in decay rates of shoots of three other species. In contrast, across the latitudinal gradient, decomposition rates of Salicornia pacifica litter were greater in high marsh than in low marsh. Rates were not correlated with sediment temperature or organic content, but were associated with plant assemblage structure including above-ground cover, species composition, and species richness. Decomposition rates also varied by litter type; at two sites in the Pacific Northwest, the grasses Deschampsia cespitosa and Distichlis spicata decomposed more slowly than the forb S. pacifica. Our data suggest that elevation gradients and vegetation structure in tidal marshes both affect rates of litter decay, potentially leading to complex spatial patterns in sediment carbon dynamics. Climate change may thus have direct effects on rates of decomposition through increased inundation from sea-level rise and indirect effects through changing plant community composition.",10.1007/s10021-017-0111-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011589278&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-017-0111-6&partnerID=40&md5=9fb98ed72241123539f01ac90fc2c45d,Janousek_2017_90075030,"Janousek, Christopher N.; Buffington, Kevin J.; Guntenspergen, Glenn R.; Thorne, Karen M.; Dugger, Bruce D.; Takekawa, John Y."

Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)).

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.",10.1111/gcb.15248,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089185406&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.15248&partnerID=40&md5=0a06b229ec01501464fbcdc33a006333,Kauffman_2020_90075318,"Kauffman, J.

Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators.

As a correct species assignment is crucial for ecological studies, the data presented here are substantiated using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genome to verify the systematic status of the mudsnail taxon in question. A comparative molecular analysis involving almost all brackish-water taxa of Hydrobiinae indicates that the populations from the Evros Delta belong to the Pontic species Ventrosia maritima, a taxon that was not reported before from the Mediterranean.

Sediments were collected at 5-cm intervals and analyzed for iron distribution in the solid phase using a two-step sequential extraction. The upper 50 cm of the sediment pore waters are mostly sulfidic during both winter and summer. The pore water and sediment geochemistry suggest organic matter degradation is coupled mostly to Fe (III) and sulfate reduction. In summer, there is greater accumulation of alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate in the pore waters and lower levels of ascorbate extractable Fe, which is presumed to be comprised primarily of readily reducible Fe(III) oxides, in the sediments, consistent with higher organic matter degradation rates in summer compared to winter.

One pair is located adjacent to a large tidal creek, and includes a nearly unvegetated site and a site densely vegetated by tall-form Spartina alterniflora. The other two sites, located higher in the marsh, are densely vegetated by Juncus roemarianus and sparsely vegetated by short-form S. alternifora. At each site, trace element distributions among four operationally-defined solid fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, reducible and oxidizable) were measured at 4-5 cm intervals from the sediment water interface to a depth of up to 50 cm. The operationally-defined extractions suggest that in suboxic sediments, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co and Zn occur in association with Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides. In sulfidic sediments, Fe, Co and Ni probably occur mostly in pyrite. Mn is likely pyritized and may also form rhodochrosite at two of the sites, Cr is likely bound mostly to organic matter, and Zn, Cu and Pb are inferred to occur in association with both sulfides and organic matter. The depth- and site-dependent trace element distributions are in surprisingly good agreement with variations in redox geochemistry inferred from pore water data in a companion study [Koretsky, C.M., Haveman, M., Cuellar, A., Beuving, L., Shattuck, T., Wagner, M., 2008.

Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary OM composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content (TOC) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23% and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) also showed a wide range between -22.4 and -27.0 parts per thousand. A(13)C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic C-13 enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments.

Carbon preference index ratio (CPI) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C-24-C-31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse OM inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant OM derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments.

Nekton, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and soil and water quality variables were sampled bimonthly from April 2004 through April 2005 at four subtidal habitat types: terraced nearshore, terraced open water, unterraced nearshore, and unterraced open water. Results indicate that terraced ponds had increased the habitat value of degrading unterraced ponds over open water areas for estuarine nekton; nekton density and richness were similar between terraced and unterraced nearshore habitat types, but greater at all nearshore as compared to open water sites. Analysis of the distribution of nekton functional groups and weight:length ratios indicates the terraced and unterraced pond habitats were not functioning similarly: distribution of nekton functional groups differed significantly between habitat types with greater percentages of benthic-oriented species at unterraced open water habitats and higher percentage of open water species in terraced ponds as compared to unterraced ponds, and two of the six numerically dominant fish species had greater weight-length relationships in unterraced ponds as compared to terraced ponds. This lack of functional equivalency may be attributed to environmental differences between terraced and unterraced ponds such as water depth or SAV biomass, or the relatively young age of the terraces studied, which may not have allowed for the development of some critical habitat variables, such as soil organic matter that was found to be significantly lower in terraced versus unterraced ponds (p < 0.05). To properly assess the ecological equivalency of restored or rehabilitated sites for nekton requires that we move beyond measures of nekton density, biomass, and diversity and incorporate measures of functional equivalency, including habitat measures.",10.1007/BF03036518,NA,La Peyre_2007_90075014,"La Peyre, Megan K.; Gossman, Bryan; Nyman, John A."

Macrofaunal densities in Pacific S. foliosa marshes (avg. 122,268 indiv. m(-2) > 300 mu m) were 3 to 10 times higher than observed in Atlantic S. alterniflora and S. anglica marshes. The macrofauna of S. foliosa marshes was composed mainly of enchytraeid, naidid, and tubificid oligochaetes (66%), with the enchytraeids dominant at all sites except Bolsa Chica Lagoon. Polychaetes, insects, and peracarid crustaceans accounted for most of the remaining fauna. Multivariate analyses indicated greatest faunal similarity between the two southernmost marshes (Mission Bay and San Diego Bay), and between Anaheim and Newport Bay marshes, with Bolsa Chica Lagoon exhibiting a distinct assemblage. There were strong positive associations of faunal abundance and composition with percent organic matter and percent open area, and negative associations with percent sand and dry weight of algae. For the vegetated marsh in Mission Bay, faunal comparisons were made with an adjacent mudflat and with a S. alterniflora marsh in North Carolina, USA. The unvegetated mudflat exhibited similar macrofaunal densities but higher species richness than the adjacent Spartina marsh. The macrofaunal assemblage of the Mission Bay S. foliosa marsh differed from that of the Atlantic S. alterniflora marsh and the Pacific mudflat in having a greater proportion of oligochaetes, especially Enchytraeidae, and fewer polychaetes. This study represents the first published description that we are aware of for macrofauna in S. foliosa vegetated marsh sediments. The findings document faunal variation among southern California embayments and suggest that differences in macrobenthic community structure occur between marsh and mudflat habitat as web as between east and west coast Spartina marshes.

This study used observations of natural variation and large-scale manipulative experiments to test the influence of vascular vegetation and soil organic matter on the rate and trajectory of macrofaunal recovery in a southern California created salt marsh, the Crown Point Mitigation Site. During the first three years following marsh establishment, macrofaunal density and species richness recovered rapidly within the Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) zone; densities in the created marsh were 50% of those in the natural marsh after 16 mo and 97% after 28 mo. However, the early successional assemblage had a lower proportion of tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes, and a higher proportion of chironomids and other insect larvae than did the mature natural marsh. Most of the colonizers arrived by rafting on sea grass and algae rather than by larval dispersal. Initial planting of S. foliosa had no influence on macrofaunal recovery, perhaps because of variable transplant survival. However, subsequently, both positive and negative correlations were observed between densities of some macrofaunal taxa and shoot densities of S. foliosa or Salicornia spp. (pickleweed). Salinity and measures of soil organics (belowground biomass, combustible organic matter, and chlorophyll a) also were correlated with macrofaunal densities and taxon richness. Of foul added soil amendments (kelp, alfalfa, peat, and Milorganite), Milorganite (a sewage product) and kelp both promoted macrofaunal colonization during year 1, but effects were short lived. The most significant sources of heterogeneity in the recovering marsh were associated with site history and climate variation. Faunal recovery was most rapid in highly localized, organic-rich marsh sediments that were remnants of the historical wetland. Elevated sea level during the 1998 El Nino corresponded with similarity of macrofaunal communities in the created and natural marshes. The large spatial scale and multi-year duration of this study revealed that natural sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may exert stronger influence on faunal succession in California wetlands than manipulation of vegetation or soil properties.",10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1785:NAMSOH]2.0.CO;2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036994925&doi=10.1890%2f1051-0761%282002%29012%5b1785%3aNAMSOH%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=ee758fde8083ed2e382cd95b660bfd1e,Levin_2002_90074473,"Levin, L.A.; Talley, T.S."

We quantified total C and N pools, and mobile fractions including extractable mineral N, extractable organic C and N, and active (aerobically mineralizable) C and N, in surface soils (top 7.6 cm) of adjacent mangrove (primarily Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh (Juncus roemerianus) vegetation zones in tidal wetlands of west-central Florida (USA). We tested whether surface-soil accumulations of C, N, and their potentially mobile fractions are greater in mangrove than in saltmarsh owing to greater accumulations in the mangrove zone of soil organic matter (SOM) and fine mineral particles (C- and N-retaining soil constituents). Extractable organic fractions were 39-45% more concentrated in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soil, and they scaled steeply and positively with SOM and fine mineral particle (silt + clay) concentrations, which themselves were likewise greater in mangrove soil. Elevation may drive this linkage. Mangrove locations were generally at lower elevations, which tended to have greater fine particle content in the surface soil. Active C and extractable mineral N were marginally (p < 0.1) greater in mangrove soil, while active N, total N, and total C showed no statistical differences between zones. Extractable organic C and N fractions composed greater shares of total C and N pools in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soils, which is meaningful for ecosystem function, as persistent leaching of this fraction can perpetuate nutrient limitation. The active (mineralizable) C and N fractions we observed constituted a relatively small component of total C and N pools, suggesting that mangrove surface soils may export less C and N than would be expected from their large total C and N pools.

JOUR,90074943,2021,NA,"Lewis, David Bruce",author_01,Florida mangrove saltmarsh reference surface soils,"Site description. This data package consists of data obtained from sampling surface soil (the 0-7.6 cm depth profile) in black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forest and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) saltmarsh along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in peninsular west-central Florida, USA. This location has a subtropical climate with mean daily temperatures ranging from 15.4 °C in January to 27.8 °C in August, and annual precipitation of 1336 mm. Precipitation falls as rain primarily between June and September. Tides are semi-diurnal, with 0.57 m median amplitudes during the year preceding sampling (U.S. NOAA National Ocean Service, Clearwater Beach, Florida, station 8726724). Sea-level rise is 4.0 0.6 mm per year (1973-2020 trend, mean 95 % confidence interval, NOAA NOS Clearwater Beach station). The A. germinans mangrove zone is either adjacent to water or fringed on the seaward side by a narrow band of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). A near-monoculture of J. roemerianus is often adjacent to and immediately landward of the A. germinans zone. The transition from the mangrove to the J. roemerianus zone is variable in our study area. An abrupt edge between closed-canopy mangrove and J. roemerianus monoculture may extend for up to several hundred meters in some locations, while other stretches of ecotone present a gradual transition where smaller, widely spaced trees are interspersed into the herbaceous marsh. Juncus roemerianus then extends landward to a high marsh patchwork of succulent halophytes (including Salicornia bigellovi, Sesuvium sp., and Batis maritima), scattered dwarf mangrove, and salt pans, followed in turn by upland vegetation that includes Pinus sp. and Serenoa repens. Field design and sample collection. We established three study sites spaced at approximately 5 km intervals along the western coastline of the central Florida peninsula. The sites consisted of the Salt Springs (28.3298°, -82.7274°), Energy Marine Center (28.2903°, -82.7278°), and Green Key (28.2530°, -82.7496°) sites on the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Pasco County, Florida, USA. At each site, we established three plot pairs, each consisting of one saltmarsh plot and one mangrove plot. Plots were 50 m^2 in size. Plots pairs within a site were separated by 230-1070 m, and the mangrove and saltmarsh plots composing a pair were 70-170 m apart. All plot pairs consisted of directly adjacent patches of mangrove forest and J. roemerianus saltmarsh, with the mangrove forests exhibiting a closed canopy and a tree architecture (height 4-6 m, crown width 1.5-3 m). Mangrove plots were located at approximately the midpoint between the seaward edge (water-mangrove interface) and landward edge (mangrove-marsh interface) of the mangrove zone. Saltmarsh plots were located 20-25 m away from any mangrove trees and into the J. roemerianus zone (i.e., landward from the mangrove-marsh interface). Plot pairs were coarsely similar in geomorphic setting, as all were located on the Gulf of Mexico coastline, rather than within major sheltering formations like Tampa Bay, and all plot pairs fit the tide-dominated domain of the Woodroffe classification (Woodroffe, 2002, ""Coasts: Form, Process and Evolution"", Cambridge University Press), given their conspicuous semi-diurnal tides. There was nevertheless some geomorphic variation, as some plot pairs were directly open to the Gulf of Mexico while others sat behind keys and spits or along small tidal creeks. Our use of a plot-pair approach is intended to control for this geomorphic variation. Plot center elevations (cm above mean sea level, NAVD 88) were estimated by overlaying the plot locations determined with a global positioning system (Garmin GPS 60, Olathe, KS, USA) on a LiDAR-derived bare-earth digital elevation model (Dewberry, Inc., 2019). The digital elevation model had a vertical accuracy of 10 cm (95 % CI) and a horizontal accuracy of 116 cm (95 % CI). Soil samples were collected via coring at low tide in June 2011. From each plot, we collected a composite soil sample consisting of three discrete 5.1 cm diameter soil cores taken at equidistant points to 7.6 cm depth. Cores were taken by tapping a sleeve into the soil until its top was flush with the soil surface, sliding a hand under the core, and lifting it up. Cores were then capped and transferred on ice to our laboratory at the University of South Florida (Tampa, Florida, USA), where they were combined in plastic zipper bags, and homogenized by hand into plot-level composite samples on the day they were collected. A damp soil subsample was immediately taken from each composite sample to initiate 1 y incubations for determination of active C and N (see below). The remainder of each composite sample was then placed in a drying oven (60 °C) for 1 week with frequent mixing of the soil to prevent aggregation and liberate water. Organic wetland soils are sometimes dried at 70 °C, however high drying temperatures can volatilize non-water liquids and oxidize and decompose organic matter, so 50 °C is also a common drying temperature for organic soils (Gardner 1986, ""Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 1"", Soil Science Society of America); we accordingly chose 60 °C as a compromise between sufficient water removal and avoidance of non-water mass loss. Bulk density was determined as soil dry mass per core volume (adding back the dry mass equivalent of the damp subsample removed prior to drying). Dried subsamples were obtained for determination of soil organic matter (SOM), mineral texture composition, and extractable and total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) within the following week. Sample analyses. A dried subsample was apportioned from each composite sample to determine SOM as mass loss on ignition at 550 °C for 4 h. After organic matter was removed from soil via ignition, mineral particle size composition was determined using a combination of wet sieving and density separation in 49 mM (3 %) sodium hexametaphosphate ((NaPO_3)_6) following procedures in Kettler et al. (2001, Soil Science Society of America Journal 65, 849-852). The percentage of dry soil mass composed of silt and clay particles (hereafter, fines) was calculated as the mass lost from dispersed mineral soil after sieving (0.053 mm mesh sieve). Fines could have been slightly underestimated if any clay particles were burned off during the preceding ignition of soil. An additional subsample was taken from each composite sample to determine extractable N and organic C concentrations via 0.5 M potassium sulfate (K_2SO_4) extractions. We combined soil and extractant (ratio of 1 g dry soil:5 mL extractant) in plastic bottles, reciprocally shook the slurry for 1 h at 120 rpm, and then gravity filtered it through Fisher G6 (1.6 mum pore size) glass fiber filters, followed by colorimetric detection of nitrite (NO_2^-) + nitrate (NO_3^-) and ammonium (NH_4^+) in the filtrate (Hood Nowotny et al., 2010,Soil Science Society of America Journal 74, 1018-1027) using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek Epoch, Winooski, VT, USA). Filtrate was also analyzed for dissolved organic C (referred to hereafter as extractable organic C) and total dissolved N via combustion and oxidation followed by detection of the evolved CO_2 and N oxide gases on a Formacs HT TOC/TN analyzer (Skalar, Breda, The Netherlands). Extractable organic N was then computed as total dissolved N in filtrate minus extractable mineral N (itself the sum of extractable NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N). We determined soil total C and N from dried, milled subsamples subjected to elemental analysis (ECS 4010, Costech, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) at the University of South Florida Stable Isotope Laboratory. Median concentration of inorganic C in unvegetated surface soil at our sites is 0.5 % of soil mass (Anderson, 2019, Univ. of South Florida M.S. thesis via methods in Wang et al., 2011, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment 174, 241-257). Inorganic C concentrations are likely even lower in our samples from under vegetation, where organic matter would dilute the contribution of inorganic C to soil mass. Nevertheless, the presence of a small inorganic C pool in our soils may be counted in the total C values we report. Extractable organic C is necessarily of organic C origin given the method (sparging with HCl) used in detection. Active C and N represent the fractions of organic C and N that are mineralizable by soil microorganisms under aerobic conditions in long-term soil incubations. To quantify active C and N, 60 g of field-moist soil were apportioned from each composite sample, placed in a filtration apparatus, and incubated in the dark at 25 °C and field capacity moisture for 365 d (as in Lewis et al., 2014, Ecosphere 5, art59). Moisture levels were maintained by frequently weighing incubated soil and wetting them up to target mass. Daily CO_2 flux was quantified on 29 occasions at 0.5-3 week intervals during the incubation period (with shorter intervals earlier in the incubation), and these per day flux rates were integrated over the 365 d period to compute an estimate of active C. Observations of per day flux were made by sealing samples overnight in airtight chambers fitted with septa and quantifying headspace CO_2 accumulation by injecting headspace samples (obtained through the septa via needle and syringe) into an infrared gas analyzer (PP Systems EGM 4, Amesbury, MA, USA). To estimate active N, each incubated sample was leached with a C and N free, 35 psu solution containing micronutrients (Nadelhoffer, 1990, Soil Science Society of America Journal 54, 411-415) on 19 occasions at increasing 1-6 week intervals during the 365 d incubation, and then extracted in 0.5 M K_2SO_4 at the end of the incubation in order to remove any residual mineral N. Active N was then quantified as the total mass of mineral N leached and extracted. Mineral N in leached and extracted solutions was detected as NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N via colorimetry as above. This incubation technique precludes new C and N inputs and persistently leaches mineral N, forcing microorganisms to meet demand by mineralizing existing pools, and thereby directly assays the potential activity of soil organic C and N pools present at the time of soil sampling. Because this analysis commences with disrupting soil physical structure, it is biased toward higher estimates of active fractions. Calculations. Non-mobile C and N fractions were computed as total C and N concentrations minus the extractable and active fractions of each element. This data package reports surface-soil constituents (moisture, fines, SOM, and C and N pools and fractions) in both gravimetric units (mass constituent / mass soil) and areal units (mass constituent / soil surface area integrated through 7.6 cm soil depth, the depth of sampling). Areal concentrations were computed as X * D * 7.6, where X is the gravimetric concentration of a soil constituent, D is soil bulk density (g dry soil / cm^3), and 7.6 is the sampling depth in cm.",NA,NA,Lewis_2021_90074943,"Lewis, David Bruce"

Our results demonstrated that the changing trend of inorganic sulfur (IS) and total sulfur (TS) contents were consistent. TS and IS contents in SEW and SHW soils showed a decrease and then an increase in the whole sampling dates. TS and IS showed significant differences between the TFW and SEW soils (p < 0.05). Water-soluble sulfate (H2O-S) contents exhibited a ""decreasing then increasing"" trend after the regulation (from July to October) in the SHW (7.86-19.23 mg/kg) and SEW (8.12-16.27 mg/kg) soils, whereas the TFW (21.35-30.58 mg/kg) soils showed an opposite trend after the regulation.

The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge.

JOUR,90074763,2014,NA,"Luo, Min",author_01,Abundance and speciation of iron across a subtropical tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea,"Iron has profound influence on anaerobic organic matter oxidation and Fe-S-C biogeochemical cycling in tidal marshes. To examine the abundance and speciation of iron, six iron species (poor crystalline Fe(III), crystalline Fe(III), non-sulfidic Fe(II), porewater Fe2+, FeS, and FeS2) were investigated in a cross transect (span = 250 m, depth = similar to 1.2 m) in a tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea. The results suggested that sediment characteristics, pH, redox condition, conductivity, chloride, sulfate, and organic matter create a highly heterogeneous geochemical framework in the cross transect. Correspondingly, the zonation of iron species differed significantly across the tidal marsh. Poor crystalline Fe(III) (48 +/- 24 mu mol g 1) and crystalline Fe(III) (75 +/- 32 mu mol g 1) accumulated on the surface of the high-tide zone and decreased with elevation. The non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals (140 +/- 61 mu mol g 1) accounted for the largest proportion of the six iron species. The porewater Fe2+ was enriched within the deep layer of the upland region (pH = 6.2-6.5) and exhibited a maximum of 11.49 mM. The aqueous sulfide concentration was below detection. FeS (39 +/- 6 mu mol g 1) and FeS2 (57 +/- 25 mu mol g 1) accumulated closer to the lower extremity. Tidal water brought O-2 and removed certain amounts of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and Fe(III)-bearing particles in an element budget during tidal inundation.

JOUR,90074722,2013,NA,"Macreadie, Peter I.",author_01,Loss of 'Blue Carbon' from Coastal Salt Marshes Following Habitat Disturbance,"Increased recognition of the global importance of salt marshes as 'blue carbon' (C) sinks has led to concern that salt marshes could release large amounts of stored C into the atmosphere (as CO2) if they continue undergoing disturbance, thereby accelerating climate change. Empirical evidence of C release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare, yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes. Here we investigated the stability of salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora) sediment C levels following seagrass (Thallasia testudinum) wrack accumulation; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes. At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term 'refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0069244,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879983342&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0069244&partnerID=40&md5=fb2f0fb9a1b05349d291728ecad70fba,Macreadie_2013_90074722,"Macreadie, Peter I.; Hughes, A.

JOUR,90074734,2012,NA,"Macreadie, Peter I.",author_01,Paleoreconstruction of estuarine sediments reveal human-induced weakening of coastal carbon sinks,"Human activities in coastal areas frequently cause loss of benthic macrophytes (e.g. seagrasses) and concomitant increases in microalgal production through eutrophication. Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02582.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857137924&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2486.2011.02582.x&partnerID=40&md5=cfd1e9fdd645bf9256f6b61fc8bb3138,Macreadie_2012_90074734,"Macreadie, Peter I.; Allen, Katie; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Ralph, Peter J.; Skilbeck, Charles G."

Here, a study is conducted in the mudflat, open shrubland, and dense shrubland in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, and soil organic C (OC) stock, particulate organic matter C (POMC), and aggregate-associated OC in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths are investigated along these vegetation zones. Among the three vegetation zones, dense shrubland had the greatest soil OC stock, open shrubland had the lowest value, and mudflat had an intermediate value. In each soil depth, dense shrubland generally had higher soil OC and POMC concentrations, and POMC/OC ratio compared to mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. Moreover, dense shrubland had a greater proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) and OC content in the macro-aggregates than mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. In addition, the OC content in the soil macro-aggregates positively correlated with soil POMC concentration. These results suggest that the high spatial variability in soil OC quantity and quality along the vegetation zones should be incorporated to accurately develop regional C budget in coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, and also imply that a shift in vegetation zones induced by sea level rise could potentially cause substantial changes in the quantity and quality of soil OC in the tidal salt marshes.",10.1002/clen.201800049,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045133852&doi=10.1002%2fclen.201800049&partnerID=40&md5=c6c924e8f41c53acb5675879c74514ef,Mao_2018_90074345,"Mao, Rong; Ye, Si-Yuan; Zhang, Xin-Hou"

S. salsa increased soil organic C, total N, POMC and POMN concentrations in both soil layers. Interestingly, the presence of S. salsa caused an increase in the amount of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in both 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths, whereas the vegetation effect on microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt- and clay-sized fractions (< 0.053 mm) differed with soil depth. Compared with bare grounds, S. salsa clusters had higher soil organic C and N contents at each aggregate size class. Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest.

JOUR,90075296,2015, Europe,"Moreno, J.",author_01,"Bromine enrichment in marsh sediments as a marker of environmental changes driven by Grand Solar Minima and anthropogenic activity (Caminha, NW of Portugal)","A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

JOUR,90075302,2017, Europe,"Moreno, J.",author_01,Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries,"This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic matter in the top 5 cm of sediment was 475 g C m(-2) lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1). It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates that the increase in soil respiration was largely due to an increase in primary production. Sediment respiration in laboratory incubations also demonstrated positive effects of nutrients.

The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.",10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00251.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031806163&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2745.1998.00251.x&partnerID=40&md5=dcc358977cbe58d9c880e6c0b1d5ef3c,Morris_1998_90075070,"Morris, J.T.; Jensen, A."

Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock.

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.",10.1002/ecs2.2556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010,Mueller_2019_90074609,"Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"
JOUR,90075078,2016,NA,"Mueller, Peter",author_01,Plants mediate soil organic matter decomposition in response to sea level rise,"Tidal marshes have a large capacity for producing and storing organic matter, making their role in the global carbon budget disproportionate to land area. Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.",10.1111/gcb.13082,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954167983&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.13082&partnerID=40&md5=51d641e0070edfb33c81a56c69408984,Mueller_2016_90075078,"Mueller, Peter; Jensen, Kai; Megonigal, James Patrick"
JOUR,90075095,2017,NA,"Mueller, Peter",author_01,Data from: Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils,"Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues.

The POM concentration was greater in the high marsh than in the low marsh, with no effect of vegetation. Ammonium was the most abundant nitrogen nutrient species in pore water, except in the non-vegetated high marsh where nitrate concentration was higher.

Key to ecosystem functioning is wetland response to sea-level rise through accumulation of mineral and organic sediment. The organic sediment within coastal wetlands is composed of carbon sequestered over the time scale of the wetland?s existence. This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring. Marsh surface elevations were measured at each site (ranging from 0.771 meters to 1.462 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the marsh boundaries within current tidal conditions. Continuous Rate of Supply age models, based on lead-210 and cesium-137 isotope analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Over that time, accretion rates were very similar for each ecosystem: restored marsh sites (2.5 mm per year), followed by the salt marshes (2.7 mm per year) and mature mangroves (3.2 mm per year). The resulting carbon burial rates over the past century vary as a function of vegetation type, with mature mangroves burying on average 163 grams carbon per square meter per year, compared to young (restoring) mangroves with an average of 94 grams carbon per square meter per year and the salt marsh with an average of 64 grams carbon per square meter per year .

This study explored the ability of using testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) from sediments of a freshwater tidal marsh as indicators of water level in an inland estuary. The hypothesis was that modern testate amoeba assemblages change with surface elevation (approximately the duration of tidal flooding) within a freshwater tidal marsh. Variation in testate amoeba assemblages in relation to multiple environmental variables and sediment characteristics was studied through redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that a significant part of the variation in modern testate amoeba assemblages could be explained by flooding frequency, surface elevation, organic content and particle size of the soil. Transfer functions, partial least squares and weighted average regressions were made to show that testate amoebae can be used for reconstruction of water level (with an accuracy of 0.05 Normalized Elevation). A preliminary test of application of the transfer function to palaeo testate amoeba assemblages showed promising results.

On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone's testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (similar to elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh. Testate amoeba assemblages in such a brackish habitat show thus a vertical zonation (RMSEP: 0.19 m) that is comparable to the vertical zonation of testate amoebae and other protists on freshwater tidal marshes and salt marshes.",10.4467/16890027AP.12.022.0768,NA,Ooms_2012_90075219,"Ooms, Marijke; Beyens, Louis; Temmerman, Stijn"

JOUR,90075060,2020,NA,"Owers, Christopher J.",author_01,Temperate coastal wetland near-surface carbon storage: Spatial patterns and variability,"Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous, nevertheless are commonly described on the basis of vegetation distribution within the intertidal zone. Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106584,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077913513&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2020.106584&partnerID=40&md5=e6a1ecd17713d251da68451818868114,Owers_2020_90075060,"Owers, Christopher J.; Rogers, Kerrylee; Mazumder, Debashish; Woodroffe, Colin D."

Flooding periods were greatest in natural and least in drained marshes.Differences between the chemistry of the natural and diked marshes depended upon the depth of the water table and the supply of sulfate for anaerobic metabolism. Drained marsh sediments were highly acidic (pH < 4) with porewaters rich in dissolved Fe; the natural and diked flooded marshes had pH 6-7.5 and Fe orders of magnitude lower. Porewater nutrients, sulfides and alkalinity were much lower in both flooded and drained diked marshes than in the natural marsh.Sediments of the drained marsh had subsided 90 cm relative to the natural site due to organic matter decomposition and compaction. However, despite the loss of organic matter, much of the P and N was retained, with NH4 likely protected from nitrification by low pH and PO4 adsorbed on Fe and Al oxides. Iron, and to a lesser degree sulfur, had also been well retained by the sediment. Despite eight decades of diking, substantial amounts of reduced S, representing potential acidity, persisted near the top of the water table.In contrast, the surface of the seasonally flooded marsh was only 15 cm below the natural marsh. Accretion since diking amounted to 25 cm and involved proportionally less mineral matter.The restoration of seawater flow to both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes will likely extend flooding depth and duration, lower redox, increase cation exchange, and thereby increase NH4, Fe(II), and PO4 mobilization. Increased porewater nutrients could benefit recolonizing halophytes but may also degrade surface water quality.",10.1023/A:1005715520988,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030621152&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1005715520988&partnerID=40&md5=82628e9390704a555ff40256d0b91969,Portnoy_1997_90074366,"Portnoy, J.W.; Giblin, A.E."
JOUR,90075164,1999,NA,"Portnoy, J.W.",author_01,Salt marsh diking and restoration: Biogeochemical implications of altered wetland hydrology,"In salt marshes, most biomass plus large reserves of biologically important N, P, Fe, and S are sequestered below ground under saline, waterlogged, and anaerobic conditions. Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.",10.1007/s002679900219,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033008677&doi=10.1007%2fs002679900219&partnerID=40&md5=a02872bdefb52ba1e43eaf0502d16830,Portnoy_1999_90075164,"Portnoy, J.W."

In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore whether and how microtopographical modification by the herbivorous crab Helice tientsinensis stimulates the growth of the saltmarsh plant Suaeda salsa. Results showed that, despite grazing on S. salsa, H. tientsinensis can promote density, total biomass, average plant height, average root length, and average biomass through burrowing-generated concave-convex microtopography, which can improve the edaphic environment (decreased soil hardness and salinity, and increased soil moisture content, oxidation-reduction potential, and carbon and nitrogen content), and provide plants more clustered growth opportunities that could facilitate positive intraspecific plant interactions.

Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography.

Concentrations of these metals were also analysed in above- and belowground parts of Spartina maritima, as well as in sediments colonised by the plant. The highest metal concentrations in sediments were found in the marshes near the industrial and urban areas, whereas metal concentrations in plants were not significantly different among sites. This was thought to be a consequence of differences observed in metal bioavailability: Metals in Pancas, the least polluted location, were largely associated to easily accessible fractions for plant uptake, probably as a result of low organic matter content and high sandy fraction in sediments. S. maritima was able to induce the concentration of metals between its roots in the three salt marshes. The results obtained in this study indicate that S. maritima could be useful to induce phytostabilisation of metals in sediments, although the effectiveness to modify chemical associations is highly dependent on existing sediment parameters, and thus different results could be obtained depending on site characteristics.",10.1007/s10750-008-9340-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149140025&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-008-9340-1&partnerID=40&md5=6fab3dcea7c414f6bd8b9ae65162fb4e,Reboreda_2008_90074636,"Reboreda, Rosa; Cacador, Isabel; Pedro, Silvia; Almeida, Pedro Raposo"

Our aim was a better understanding of the influence of the halophyte on microbial activity in the rhizosphere under different site conditions, and its potential consequences for metal cycling and phytoremediation in salt marshes. Acid phosphatase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase presented significantly higher EEA in Rosario than in Pancas, whereas the opposite occurred for peroxidase. This was mainly attributed to differences in organic matter between the two sites. A positive correlation between root biomass and EEA of hydrolases (P-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was found, indicating a possible influence of the halophyte in sediment microbial function.

JOUR,90074622,2015, Europe,"Ribeiro, Hugo",author_01,Salt marsh sediment characteristics as key regulators on the efficiency of hydrocarbons bioremediation by Juncus maritimus rhizospheric bacterial community,"Mitigation of petroleum hydrocarbons was investigated during a 5-month greenhouse experiment, to assess the rhizoremediation (RR) potential in sediments with different characteristics colonized by Juncus maritimus, a salt marsh plant commonly found in temperate estuaries. Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.",10.1007/s11356-014-3388-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925728845&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-014-3388-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf992459c58cc8e85529f37707ced3f5,Ribeiro_2015_90074622,"Ribeiro, Hugo; Almeida, C.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants.

Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period.

Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR.

Organic analysis utilized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) for PAHs, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) for pesticides and PCBs. Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks. The spatial distribution of organic contaminants was evaluated in four of these tidal creek-salt marsh systems representing urban/industrial, suburban, and forested watersheds, from, the creek channel. to the adjacent uplands. The distribution of organic contaminants within each representative creek was not concordant with the total organic carbon or the clay content of the sediment. The representative industrial/urban creek-marsh system, Diesel Creek, had the highest concentration of PAHs in the creek channel and the highest concentration of PCBs and DDT on the marsh surface, primarily in the upper portion of the system, The representative suburban creek-marsh system, Shem Creek, had elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs throughout the entire system. This system also had one site with a total PAH concentration of 324,000 ppb and a total DDT concentration that was 20-100 times higher than the other sites.

Mineral compounds accounted for an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (to 97% of the total content) was represented by organic substances (N-org).

Distribution patterns of the amino acid nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the soil profiles were similar. The qualitative composition of amino compounds was relatively uniform, and the ratios of most of them were close.

The share of glycine increased downward the profile from 12 to 20%, and the shares of aspartic and glutamic acids decreased from 11 to 6%.

Mangroves and salt marsh differ in vegetation structure, yet offer similar ecosystem services. This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.",10.1007/s12237-018-0442-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052137156&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-018-0442-3&partnerID=40&md5=c787996bb4df80de55eaf84eaf931ca9,Simpson_2019_90074980,"Simpson, L.

Permanent plots were established in pure salt marsh habitat along the Atlantic coast of Florida in 2015, and by 2018, mangrove saplings had encroached into plots. In this study, above- and belowground biomass measurements and soil C in the top 10-cm soil profile were quantified in 2018 and compared to 2015 data to better understand the effects of mangrove encroachment on C storage in salt marsh habitat. Plant and soil fractions were tested for C-13 stable isotopic signatures to elucidate soil C sources. In 3 years, mangrove biomass increased dramatically and soil C doubled in pure salt marsh plots, consequently increasing total C in the system. Soil organic matter increased, while there was no change in soil C:N.

The sequential extraction procedure proposed by Tessier was used to estimate the percentages of the metals present in each geochemical phase of the sediment. Metal concentrations in the solid phase were found to be enriched in the upper layers and mainly associated with reactive fractions such as organic matter, Fe - Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates (46 - 74% of Ni, Mn and Cd, and 11 - 19% of Cu and Zn). Principal factor analysis (PFA) and Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association of metals and their reactive phases with OC (the diagenetic component), and a negative or non-association with the mud content, Al, Fe and Li (the lithogenic component). Diagenetically released metals are mainly mobilized within hypersaline sediments by buoyancy transport (> 90% of total flux) in response to an extreme salinity gradient by input of fresh groundwater (3 - 6 psu cm(-1)). The. molecular diffusion due to the gradient of metals in porewater (maximum and higher levels at 5 - 7 and below 20 cm depth, respectively) is significantly less important to the advective transport. Most of the metals mobilized by diffusion - advection processes are re-precipitated in the sediments by authigenic minerals, only < 10% of most metals are extruded out to the overlying water column. Authigenic accumulation rates were estimated as 1.42 - 7.09 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Cd; 58.8 - 378 for Cu; 6922 - 17,985 for Fe; 38.2 - 345 for Mn; 20.8 - 263 for Ni; and 282 - 2956 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Zn. The Mn - Fe oxyhydroxides (40 - 85% of reactive metals) in the upper oxic - suboxic layers (< 5 cm below surface) and sulfide minerals (75 - 97%) in anoxic sediment layers (7 - 18 cm) constitute the main scavengers for metals.

In addition, we measured the stable isotopic composition of Pb in order to distinguish its input sources. Concentrations of Pb increased from low or background values in the bottommost layer (<60 cm depth), followed by fluctuations in the middle layer (20-60 cm) and peak values in the subsurface layer (3-5 cm). Pb associated to reactive fractions (e.g. OM, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates) accounted for 60% of that initially deposited. Stable Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-207/Pb-208) suggested that most of the Pb in the upper sediments (1.204 +/- 0.002 and 2.469 +/- 0.007) is still derived from the leaded gasoline combustion (1.201 +/- 0.006 and 2.475 +/- 0.005). Profile of dissolved Pb was related to those for ammonium, phosphates and dissolve Fe and Mn, which reveals the influence of the diagenetic reactions on the Pb behavior. OM. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and the sulfide minerals play a significant role for mobilizing and trapping the Pb. Metal mobilization was calculated considering an advective-diffusive system. The advective process constitutes the dominant mechanism of Pb mobilization. A low diffusive outflux with respect to the Pb mobilization rate suggested that most of the released Pb is retained in the sediments. Authigenic oxides precipitated at the oxic-suboxic layers (0-4 cm depth) and authigenic sulfide minerals formed Pb in the anoxic layers (7-20 cm depth) constituting the main scavengers for Pb that is diagenetically released. This retention has significant environmental implications because it reduces the availability and toxicity of Pb to biota, including humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

Disturbances, such as eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus (August) and traced into lipids representing benthic microalgae (BMA) and bacteria. Bacteria assimilated C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora at similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly transferred to BMA, likely via bacterial respiration. Overall, nutrient enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments. Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen enrichment effects were limited as well as provide a mechanism for retaining newly fixed and detrital carbon in coastal sediments.",10.3354/meps11587,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959449581&doi=10.3354%2fmeps11587&partnerID=40&md5=38b8071c2b1dac15c6e0246e23bfce3d,Spivak_2016_90075083,"Spivak, Amanda C.; Ossolinski, Justin"

These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited.

Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates.

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates.

Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively.

The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion.

JOUR,90074516,2020,NA,"Steinmuller, Havalend E.",author_01,Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh,"Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates.

Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts.

The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.",10.1007/s11368-018-2177-y,NA,Sun_2019_90074631,"Sun, Zhigao; Li, Jiabing; He, Tao; Tian, Liping; Li, Jing; Li, Xiao"

Over all sampling periods, CH4 fluxes averaged between -0.392 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and 0.495 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), and emissions occurred during spring (0.008 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.068 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed during summer (-0.110 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (-0.009 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). CH4 fluxes from the four marshes were not significantly different (p > 0.05), and emissions occurred in LSM (0.026 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and BF (0.055 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed in HSM (-0.035 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and MSM (-0.022 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average CH4 flux from the intertidal zone was 0.002 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), indicating that coastal marsh acted as a weak CH4 source. Temporal variations of CH4 emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (temperatures, soil moisture and salinity) and the variations of limited C and mineral N in sediments, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.This study observed a large spatial variation of CH4 fluxes across the coastal marsh of the Yellow River estuary (CV = 7856.25 %), suggesting that the need to increase the spatial replicates at fine scales before the regional CH4 budget was evaluated precisely. With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.",10.1007/s11104-012-1564-1,NA,Sun_2013_90074736,"Sun, Zhigao; Jiang, Huanhuan; Wang, Lingling; Mou, Xiaojie; Sun, Wanlong"

Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles. Heavy metal levels in sediments of the Min River estuary were much higher compared with most estuaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern.

Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) also play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively. The abundance of both methanogens and SRB in the sediment of the P. australis marsh with the highest sediment organic carbon content was higher than in the C. malaccensis and S. alterniflora marshes. Mean pore water DMS concentrations over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile under the S. alterniflora marsh were higher than those in the C. malaccensis marsh and P. australis marsh. Methane production rate correlated weakly with the abundance of methanogens across the three marsh zones together, but did not correlate with the concentrations of pore water acetate and DMS. Our results suggest that the abundance of methanogens is controlled by sediment organic carbon supply, and further, methane production is affected by the abundance of methanogens in the subtropical estuarine brackish marshes.",10.1007/s12237-014-9930-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943350835&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-014-9930-2&partnerID=40&md5=bab2330041b343b09fc85c646fff054c,Tong_2015_90075222,"Tong, C.; She, C.

Here, we quantify how marsh erosion differs between saline and brackish marshes of the Mississippi Delta. We analyzed long-term (1932-2015) maps of marsh loss and developed an algorithm to distinguish edge erosion from interior loss. We found that the edge erosion rate remains nearly constant at decadal timescales, whereas interior loss varies by more than 100%. On average, roughly half of marsh loss can be attributed to edge erosion, the other half to interior loss. Based on data from 42 cores, brackish marsh soils had a lower bulk density (0.17 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3)), a higher organic content (43% vs. 26%), a lower shear strength (2.0 vs. 2.5 kPa), and a lower shear strength in the root layer (13.8 vs. 20.7 kPa) than saline marsh soils. We then modified an existing marsh edge erosion model by including a salinity-dependent erodibility. By calibrating the erodibility with the observed retreat rates, we found that the brackish marsh is two to three times more erodible than the saline marshes. Overall, this model advances the ability to simulate estuarine systems as a whole, thus transcending the salinity boundaries often used in compartmentalized marsh models.",10.1002/esp.5108,NA,Valentine_2021_90075038,"Valentine, Kendall; Bruno, Grayton; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"
JOUR,90075040,2022,NA,"Valentine, Kendall",author_01,Benthic Biofilm Potential for Organic Carbon Accumulation in Salt Marsh Sediments,"Coastal salt marshes are productive environments with high potential for carbon accumulation and storage. Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.",10.1007/s13157-021-01528-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122921800&doi=10.1007%2fs13157-021-01528-0&partnerID=40&md5=5177269d35eb348e8e758c2290d7f0bb,Valentine_2022_90075040,"Valentine, Kendall; Hotard, Abbey; Elsey-Quirk, Tracy; Mariotti, Giulio"
JOUR,90074835,2016, Europe,"Van de Broek, Marijn",author_01,Controls on soil organic carbon stocks in tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient,"Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.",10.5194/bg-13-6611-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006355608&doi=10.5194%2fbg-13-6611-2016&partnerID=40&md5=7655f8f0776015827d9fb54deb45e299,Van de Broek_2016_90074835,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Temmerman, Stijn; Merckx, Roel; Govers, Gerard"

Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.",10.1111/gcb.14089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042585405&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14089&partnerID=40&md5=ca6b3949132cd145c5ff964e9c7784b3,Van de Broek_2018_90075086,"Van de Broek, Marijn; Vandendriessche, Caroline; Poppelmonde, Dries; Merckx, Roel; Temmerman, Stijn; Govers, Gerard"

Reducing the current uncertainty on the amount of OC stored these sediments requires the analysis of a large number of sediment samples. Soil sensing techniques, using mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been proven to be a valid alternative for standard OC measurements in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the application of these techniques to tidal marsh sediments has been very limited and the error associated with calculated sedimentary OC stocks using MIR spectroscopy/PLSR data has up till now not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the potential of MIR spectroscopy/PLSR to predict the OC concentration and OC stock of tidal marsh sediments in a temperate estuary (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and The Netherlands). Based on a cross -validation procedure, the results show that MIR spectroscopy/PLSR predicts the OC concentration of tidal marsh sediments along the entire estuary with a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.56% OC). Similar accuracies were obtained for the prediction of sedimentary OC concentrations from independent tidal marshes. Organic carbon concentrations from tidal marshes in the salt portion of the estuary were, however, predicted more accurately using a PLSR model trained exclusively with sediment samples from this salinity zone. Combining depth profiles of predicted OC concentrations with measured bulk densities resulted in predictions of total OC stocks with a relative error < 4% for freshwater and brackish marshes, while errors for salt marshes were up to 30%.

Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1). The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites (mostly >= 1% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5% N), decreased to approximately 0.6% N by 1940, and then remained constant to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3 plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level.

Sediment accumulation rates, measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology, ranged from 48 to 81 mg cm(2) y(-1), whereas corresponding accretion rates ranged from 0.16 to 0.30 cm y(-1). Sediment nitrogen (N) accumulation rates increased twofold at an upper bay site, starting in the mid-1950s, whereas at other locations, only small to no increases were seen with time. Phosphorus (P) accumulation was minimal with time. N and P accumulation rates were higher between the 1940s to 1950s at stations BB-1 and BB-3, while higher accumulation rate in the down-bay (BB-4) was identified in the early 1990s. Results indicate that bay marshes can sequester approximately 79 +/- 11% of N and 54 +/- 34% of P entering the Bay from upland sources; thus, these marshes perform an important ecosystem service in the form of nutrient sequestration. Marsh accretion rates at the coring sites fall at, to just below, rates of relative sea-level rise recorded by nearby tide gauges. These relatively low rates of accretion render the marsh vulnerable to inundation should the rate of sea-level rise accelerate in the future.",10.2112/SI78-008.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038391467&doi=10.2112%2fSI78-008.1&partnerID=40&md5=30b845d07f76d749e607e9c862a60538,Velinsky_2017_90074913,"Velinsky, David J.; Paudel, Bhanu; Belton, Thomas J.; Sommerfield, Christopher K."
JOUR,90075303,2020,NA,Wang Yan,author_01,Distribution characteristics and influencing factors of the benthic macroinvertebrate functional groups in the salt marshes of Chongming Dongtan,"Based on monthly surveys in the salt marshes of Chongming Dongtan in the Yangtze Estuary, we analyzed the distribution characteristics of macroinvertebrate functional groups and driving factors , especially exotic plants , along an elevation gradient. The results showed that dominant species varied across different elevations. Both omnivores and herbivores were dominant functional groups in the middle tiddal zone , while omnivores were dominant in the other sites. Both the abundance and biomass of each functional group significantly varied along the elevation gradient (P<0.01) , and such variations differed for different functional groups. The abundance and biomass of carnivores in the lowest mudflat were significantly higher than those in the vegetated zones (P< 0.05 ) , while those of herbivores in the middle tidal zone, occupied by Scirpus mariqueter, were significantly higher than that in the other sites (P<0.05). Main habitat factors (including total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic matter, available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen contents and median-sized grain of the sediment) , and shoot height and aboveground biomass of the vegetation, varied significantly along the elevation gradient ( P <0.05) , and the characteristics of those variations changed among different factors. The invasion of Spartina alterniflora did not change the dominant functional group in the high tidal zone, but increased the abundance and biomass of omnivores (P<0.05). Some environmental factors, including available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and organic matter of the sediment , were significantly different between invasive S. alterniflora and natural Phragmites australis zones (P<0.05). The variations of the composition and distribution of the benthic macroinvertebrate functional groups were determined by the combination of multiple environmental factors, while the main factors varied with groups. Nutrient content and salinity of the sediment were the most important factors driving the abundance and biomass of the functional groups, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the comprehensive effects of various environmental variables including hydrology, vegetation and sediment when we examine the distribution characteristics and underlying mechanism of functional groups of benthic macroinvertebrate.",10.13292/j.1000-4890.202003.008,NA,NA_2020_90075303,Wang Yan; Tong Chun-fu; Tang Lin; Wu A-na; Wu Feng-run
JOUR,90075367,2017,NA,Wang Yan,author_01,Distribution characteristics of crab burrows in Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in the Yangtze Estuary and their influencing factors,"Crab burrows have a unique structure, which is essential for ecosystem functions and for the survival and reproduction of crabs in tidal salt marshes. Studies on the distribution characteristics of the burrows, and corresponding factors that influence such features, provide an important basis to reveal the ecosystem functions of crabs and their burrows. In October 2015, we conducted surveys on crab burrows in three typical salt marsh habitats in the northern tidal flat of Chongming Island; Phragmites australis habitat, Spartina alterniflora habitat, and P. australis - S. alterniflorg, mixed habitat. In each habitat, the characteristics of crab burrows and related factors, including macrobenthos, vegetation, and sediment, were surveyed. The results indicated that the type of the habitat influenced the crab burrow distributions and their related factors. Burrow densities and opening diameters were significantly different among the different habitats (P < 0.05). The burrow density in P. australis habitat was significantly higher than that in S. alterniflora habitat (P < 0.05), whereas the burrow opening diameter in S. alterniflora habitat was significantly greater than that in P. australis habitat (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in biomass, macrobenthos density, and belowground biomass of plants among the different habitats (P > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in shoot density, height, aboveground biomass of the vegetation, as well as water content, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential of the sediment among the different habitats (P < 0.05). The differences among the habitats in the total carbon content, total nitrogen content, and median particle diameter of the sediments varied with depth. The different combinations of habitat factors resulted in a variation in the distribution characteristics of crab burrows. In the present study, although the combination of several selected factors was significantly correlated with the crab burrow distribution characteristics, the coefficient was relatively low. Therefore, there could be other factors that were not included in the survey that also affected burrow distribution and characteristics. Further study should extend the scope of the factors and strengthen the comprehensive analysis.",10.5846/stxb201607311570,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028603657&doi=10.5846%2fstxb201607311570&partnerID=40&md5=7921da7c1848a86d73f48897d9ecb917,NA_2017_90075367,Wang Yan; Tong Chunfu

After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The changes in aggregates and organic carbon fractions in the natural salt marsh, 10-year and 15-year freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary were studied by 120-day field in situ culture experiments with Phragmites australis straw addition. The results showed that straw addition mainly enhanced the soil aggregate stability in the 10-year freshwater pumping area, and the organic carbon content of small macro-aggregates increased significantly by 26.36% (P < 0.05). In particular, the content of coarse particulate organic carbon (cPOC) with small macro-aggregates in all areas increased significantly with the addition of straw (P < 0.05). For small macro-aggregates in the 10-year pumping area, the cPOC contents increased significantly by 21.73 g/kg (P < 0.05); and were significantly higher than the fine particulate organic carbon (fPOC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (mSOC) contents, as the fPOC contents in micro-aggregates increased by 85.92% (P < 0.05). Additionally, the cPOC contents of small macro-aggregates and fPOC contents of micro aggregates increased by 34.59% and 43.24% in the 15-year pumping area. The contents of mSOC were the lowest in different aggregates across all areas. Thus, straw addition had a significant effect on the contents of cPOC and fPOC, while freshwater pumping in the YRE could affect the distribution of fPOC and mSOC with aggregates.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

JOUR,90074439,2006,NA,"Wang, Jinxin",author_01,"The flux of methyl chloride along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh, Eastern China","Salt marshes have been suggested to be a large potential source for methyl chloride (CH3Cl) that is the major natural carrier of chlorine to the stratosphere. However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

JOUR,90075324,2006,NA,"Wang, Jinxin",author_01,Removal of methyl chloroform in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China,"The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH3CCl3 emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results indicated that the organic matter preserved in the sediments was highly affected by the marsh plants that dominated the sampling sites. delta(13)C values of organic matter preserved in the upper fresh water site sediment were more negative (-23.0+/-0.3) as affected by the C-3 plants than the values of organic matter preserved in the sediments of middle (-18.9+/-0.8) and mud flat sites (-19.4+/-0.1) as influenced mainly by the C4 marsh plants. The distribution of n-alkanes measured in all sediments showed similar patterns as those determined in the marsh grasses S. alterniflora and T. latifolia, and nC(21) to nC(33) long-chain n-alkanes were the major compounds determined in all sediment samples. The strong odd-to-even carbon numbered n-alkane predominance was found in all three sediments and nC(29) was the most abundant homologue in all samples measured. Both delta(13)C compositions of organic matter and n-alkane distributions in these sediments indicate that the marsh plants could contribute significant amount of organic matter preserved in Plum Island salt marsh sediments.

We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing.

A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %).

Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates.

In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.",10.1029/2019JG005190,NA,Yang_2019_90074297,"Yang, Ren-Min"

This work focused on the use of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) for characterizing soils and predicting key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alterniflora areas. A set of soil profiles representing a chronosequence of S. alternifiora invasion was used, comprising 45 samples from 15 sites. The results showed that approximately 20-year of S. alterniflora invasion has altered soil characteristics especially in the topsoil. Changes of soil associated with sampling horizons and ages of S. alternifiora could be distinguishable using soil variables and VNIRS, and high correlations were found between soils and spectra information. The results of predictions showed that predictive accuracy for salinity, pH, clay, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, organic carbon and calcium carbonate were acceptable, but models for total nitrogen, bulk density, sand and silt were less satisfactory. These results suggested the possibility of VNIRS for the rapid assessment of key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alternifiora areas.

We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on BD through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes.

In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of this work were to identify the consequences of plant invasion on C and N dynamics in soil organic matter (SOM) and its fractions following invasion chronosequence. In this study, we investigated the soil C and N contents and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the SOM, free light fraction (LF), infra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) in invasive 6-, 10-, 17- and 20-year-old Spartina alterniflora communities and compared with bare flat land in a coastal wetland of eastern China. S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora. The decay rate of old C decreased and the mean residence time of C increased in SOM and its fractions following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The delta N-15 values of soil under S. alterniflora were more enriched than were those in bare flat land, whereas the delta N-15 values depleted following invasion chronosequence. Our results show that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered SOC dynamics following invasion chronosequence by changing C physical distribution in SOM, S. alterniflora-derived C input and C decomposition, ultimately having a greater impact on SOC incorporation relative to SON accumulation in a coastal wetland of eastern China.",10.1016/j.catena.2017.03.021,NA,Yang_2017_90075027,"Yang, Wen; Zhao, Hui; Leng, Xin; Cheng, Xiaoli; An, Shuqing"

However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh.

Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.",10.1007/s11104-019-04184-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068345721&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-019-04184-w&partnerID=40&md5=ef8141da46ef38599b2acb312020dbd7,Yang_2019_90075390,"Yang, Wen; Jeelani, Nasreen; Xia, Lu; Zhu, Zhihong; Luo, Yiqi; Cheng, Xiaoli; An, Shuqing"

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.",10.1007/s00253-013-5104-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894298106&doi=10.1007%2fs00253-013-5104-6&partnerID=40&md5=9aef56de1efef0314e84be799212a6ac,Yuan_2014_90074341,"Yuan, Junji; Ding, Weixin; Liu, Deyan; Xiang, Jian; Lin, Yongxin"

CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply.

Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities.

Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion.

However, little information is available on the changes in soil quality caused by freshwater inputs. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in freshwater restoration wetlands (FRW), tidal salt marshes with Suaeda salsa (SSM) and tidal salt marshes with Tamarix chinensis (TSM) in the Yellow River Delta, China, in August 2015, to investigate the changes in soil quality after freshwater inputs.

The contributions of soil salinity to SQI(L) for three wetlands and SQI(NL) for TSM and SSM were the highest in the minimum data for three wetlands, while SOM showed the highest contribution proportion of SQI(NL) for FRW.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056944380&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2018.11.041&partnerID=40&md5=376a1f2cb3e2369ef66555111d2c0487,Zhao_2019_90074503,"Zhao, Qingqing; Bai, Junhong; Gao, Yongchao; Zhao, Haixiao; Huang, Yujie; Zhang, Wen; Wang, Jianing; Chen, Guanhong"
JOUR,90075075,2020,NA,"Zhao, Qingqing",author_01,"Alterations of bacterial and archaeal communities by freshwater input in coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta, China","Freshwater input has been widely used for wetland restoration. However, the consequences of freshwater input on bacteria and archaea remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Soil samples at a depth of 0-10 cm were collected in various kinds of Phragmites australis wetlands (flooded freshwater-restored (FW), nonflooding (PW) and tidal flooding (TW)) to investigate how the diversity and community structure of bacteria and archaea responded to freshwater input. The alpha-diversity metrics revealed that the bacterial richness and diversity in FW did not significantly differ from those in PW and TW (p 0.05). However, archaeal richness and diversity was higher in FW than in PW (p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Crenarchaeota constituted the predominant bacterial and archaeal phyla in FW, respectively, whereas Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Thaumarchaeota (archaea) exhibited the highest relative abundance in both PW and TW. The community structure of bacteria and archaea in TW differed from those in FW and PW, as revealed by beta diversity metrics and the analysis of similarities. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that the largest number of discriminating bacterial and archaeal taxa was found in TW. The Mantel test and Spearman correlation analysis showed that environmental variables (i.e. salinity, soil organic matter and soil texture) influenced the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure. And soil salinity parameters played a predominant role in shaping bacterial and archaeal communities. Overall, our findings indicated that freshwater input led to variations in bacterial and archaeal communities.",10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103581,NA,Zhao_2020_90075075,"Zhao, Qingqing; Zhao, Haixiao; Gao, Yongchao; Zheng, Liwen; Wang, Jianing; Bai, Junhong"
JOUR,90075199,2018,NA,"Zhao, Qingqing",author_01,Effects of water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta,"Water and salinity regulation measures have been widely taken to restore the ecological structures and functions of degraded coastal wetlands. To investigate the effects of different water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands, soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in four types of wetlands (i.e., restored tidal salt marshes (RTSM, covered with Suaeda salsa) and degraded tidal salt marshes (DTSM, bare land); freshwater restored wetlands (FRW) and degraded wetlands without freshwater inputs (DWFI), covered with Phragmites australis) during the period from August to October in 2015 in the Yellow River Delta, China. Our results showed that the mean values of total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in restored wetlands (e.g., RTSM and FRW) than those in degraded wetlands (e.g., DTSM and DWFI). Along the whole soil profile, TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC were higher in RTSM soils than those in DTSM soils except for TC and SOC in the 0-10 cm soils and DOC in the 40-50 cm soils. FRW soils contained higher TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC than DWFI except for DOC in the 0-10 cm soils. Soil TC density (TCD), SOC density (SOCD), ROOC density (ROOCD) and DOC density (DOCD) in the top 50 cm soils in restored wetlands were higher compared with degraded wetlands. Multivariate analysis showed that soil carbon was significantly influenced by EC, soil base cations and anions (e.g., K+, Ca2+ Cl- and SO42-), pH, TN, C/N ratio, bulk density (BD) and soil texture (p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that these two water and salinity regulation measures are effective in increasing soil carbon stocks of coastal wetlands.",10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.058,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039843056&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2017.10.058&partnerID=40&md5=d1fad6596cd3d348e3699874919a2fd1,Zhao_2018_90075199,"Zhao, Qingqing; Bai, Junhong; Zhang, Guangliang; Jia, Jia; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xin"
JOUR,90075234,2021,NA,"Zhao, Qingqing",author_01,"Heavy metal contamination in soils from freshwater wetlands to salt marshes in the Yellow River Estuary, China","The concentration and distribution of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and Fe were determined to estimate soil contamination in freshwater wetlands (S1 and S2), brackish wetlands (S3) and salt marshes (S4 and S5). Soil cores with depths up to 50 cm were seasonally collected with three repeats. Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3. Horizontally, eight heavy metals generally showed a decreasing and then increasing trend in the 0-40 cm soils, with the lowest and highest values in S4 and S5, respectively. Three hotspots of metal accmulation in the top 20 cm soils were observed in the study area.The sediment quality guidelines indicated that occasionally adverse effects of As and Cu can be anticipated. Besides, according to the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index, Cd exhibited no pollution to moderate pollution level in these wetlands. The potential ecological risk index indicated the moderate pollution degree in soils of five wetlands. Principle component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that eight heavy metals mainly derived from natural source, and SOM and soil texture were main factors influencing the accumulation and distribution of eight heavy metals in the studied wetlands.

JOUR,90074463,2013,NA,"Zhong, Qicheng",author_01,Effects of in situ experimental air warming on the soil respiration in a coastal salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture,"The reclamation of natural salt marshes for agricultural use is expected to profoundly influence the effects of predicted global warming on the carbon balance of coastal areas globally. This study was undertaken to understand the potential for soil respiration changes in a disturbed coastal ecosystem under future atmospheric warmingAn in situ simulated warming experiment was conducted in a reclaimed salt marsh on Chongming Island in the Yangtze Estuary, China. Open-top chambers (OTCs) were applied to simulate air-warming conditions.Based on the 2-year study, we found the following: (1) Averaged across the entire study period, the OTCs significantly increased the mean air temperature by 1.53 +/- 0.17 A degrees C. (2) The air warming resulted in no significant stimulation of the mean soil respiration averaged across the entire study period. Warming had no significant effect on soil respiration in the growing season, but it markedly reduced soil respiration by 16 % in the non-growing season. (3) Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature or volumetric moisture at a 5 cm depth, but it increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119 % averaged across the entire study period. (4) Air warming had no significant effect on total organic carbon, total nitrogen or the molar C/molar N ratio of the soil in the uppermost 10 cm layer during the 2 years of soil respiration measurement. The warming treatment also had no significant effect on aboveground biomass or fine root (< 2 mm) density during the second year of soil respiration measurement. (5) Soil temperature accounted for 81.0 % and 79.0 % of the temporal variations of soil respiration in the control (CON) and elevated temperature (ET) plots, respectively. No significant correlation between soil volumetric moisture and soil respiration was observed in either CON or ET. Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET. No change of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10) value) was observed.Based on above results, we speculate that soil porewater salinity was the key factor controlling the effects of air warming on soil respiration in the reclaimed salt marsh. Our results suggest that an air warming of approximately 1.5 A degrees C over the next few decades may not lead to a higher soil respiration in reclaimed salt marshes.",10.1007/s11104-013-1707-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884816335&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-1707-z&partnerID=40&md5=eedd2483ca4e0aafe4cafee3cdaf656b,Zhong_2013_90074463,"Zhong, Qicheng; Du, Qin; Gong, Jinnan; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Kaiyun"
JOUR,90074710,2019,NA,"Zhong, Qicheng",author_01,Responses of wetland soil carbon and nutrient pools and microbial activities after 7 years of experimental warming in the Yangtze Estuary,"Wetlands play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer. These field-experimental warming results suggested that in temperate P. australis wetlands without tidal impacts, climate warming might increase the soil organic C pools while exerting no effect on microbial C decomposition, whereas the N and P cycling that is mediated by soil microbes might be enhanced by moderate warming.",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.06.010,NA,Zhong_2019_90074710,"Zhong, Qicheng; Wang, Kaiyun; Nie, Ming; Zhang, Guilian; Zhang, Weiwei; Zhu, Yi; Fu, Yu; Zhang, Qun; Gao, Yanna"
JOUR,90074795,2006,NA,"Zhou, Junli",author_01,"Carbon and nitrogen composition and stable isotope as potential indicators of source and fate of organic matter in the salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary, China","Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions were measured for surface sediments, three sediment vibrocores, plants, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary. The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

JOUR,90075123,2007,NA,"Zhou, Junli",author_01,"Spatial variations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur in the salt marsh sediments of the Yangtze Estuary in China","Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.
