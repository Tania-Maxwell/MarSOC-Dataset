B.","author_03","A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit","Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

A.","author_05","Carbon burial and storage in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise","Coastal vegetated habitats can be important sinks of organic carbon (C-org) and mitigate global warming by sequestering significant quantities of atmospheric CO2 and storing sedimentary Corg for long periods, although their Corg burial and storage capacity may be affected by on-going sea level rise and human intervention. Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city. This implies that the sandy sediment contributes greatly to biogeochemical purification in the area, and is important for the re-distribution of materials in the coastal environment.",NA,NA,"Lee_2007_90074310","Lee, Jae Seong; An, Soonmo; Kim, SeonggGil; Kim, Seong-Soo; Jung, Raehong; PARK, Jongsoo; 박미옥; 진현국"

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9","Ferronato_2019_90075415","Ferronato, Chiara; Marinari, Sara; Francioso, Ornella; Bello, Diana; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Antisari, Livia Vittori"

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.","10.1111/ejss.12739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057766567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12739&partnerID=40&md5=4df28dfc6b1509fbc8f6f40a93ef5c62","Van de Broek_2019_90074605","Van de Broek, M.; Baert, L.; Temmerman, S.; Govers, G."

One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ""blue carbon ecosystems"" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.","10.1002/lno.12011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122708409&doi=10.1002%2flno.12011&partnerID=40&md5=d81ebb481a511605d40a7fd7aa1ec32d","Graversen_2022_90075208","Graversen, Anna Elizabeth Lovgren; Banta, Gary T.; Masque, Pere; Krause-Jensen, Dorte"

However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ""reclaimed,"" that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration.

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9","Ferronato_2019_90075415","Ferronato, Chiara; Marinari, Sara; Francioso, Ornella; Bello, Diana; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Antisari, Livia Vittori"

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105275","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103244945&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105275&partnerID=40&md5=b9dd6a3562f60f8b6afc9b4eeb48c8e5","Pollmann_2021_90074441","Pollmann, Thomas; Boettcher, Michael E.; Giani, Luise"

Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.","10.1016/j.jsames.2018.04.015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046100223&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsames.2018.04.015&partnerID=40&md5=51f948fee42121cf3f388041d6fbf014","Rios_2018_90074686","Rios, Ileana; Jose Bouza, Pablo; Bortolus, Alejandro; del Pilar Alvarez, Maria"

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6","Vitti_2020_90074914","Vitti, Stefano; Pellegrini, Elisa; Casolo, Valentino; Trotta, Giacomo; Boscutti, Francesco"

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266","Hansen_2017_90075284","Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment.

However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby.

Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.","10.1016/j.catena.2019.104331","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075738729&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104331&partnerID=40&md5=c3a335e0547ccf13f141aefab6260433","Gispert_2020_90074897","Gispert, Maria; Phang, Chantha; Carrasco-Barea, Lorena"

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.","10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107240","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101168187&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107240&partnerID=40&md5=9fca23eaef2474ce3ac52c3d7c137c6d","Gispert_2021_90075190","Gispert, Maria; Kuliush, Tetiana; Dyachenko, Lina; Kharytonov, Mykola; Emran, Mohamed; Verdaguer, Dolors; Llorens, Laura; Carrasco-Barea, Lorena"

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.","10.1007/s10021-021-00660-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108615887&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00660-6&partnerID=40&md5=3c98333d69e7f9089f95a1f2e2d667bb","Martins_2021_90074438","Martins, Marcio; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Masque, Pere; Carrasco, A.

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6","Vitti_2020_90074914","Vitti, Stefano; Pellegrini, Elisa; Casolo, Valentino; Trotta, Giacomo; Boscutti, Francesco"

The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes.

Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis. Furthermore, the constructed wetlands accumulated soil RP-C from 2.33 to 0.08 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the constructed wetlands 1 to 30 years old, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.","10.1017/S0376892910000184","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952422314&doi=10.1017%2fS0376892910000184&partnerID=40&md5=350d1189b59a74e6740dea9dc8d28636","Yu_2009_90074324","Yu, O.

Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.","10.1029/2021JG006507","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119843116&doi=10.1029%2f2021JG006507&partnerID=40&md5=5fbd9fdcff79d19e2b7c8f59e1ec1885","van Ardenne_2021_90075194","van Ardenne, L.

However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ""reclaimed,"" that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.","10.1029/2000GB001346","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035693360&doi=10.1029%2f2000GB001346&partnerID=40&md5=f05816b803c4320bb6abab7804d776eb","Connor_2001_90074694","Connor, R.F.; Chmura, G.L.; Beecher, C.B."

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere.

A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4","Santos_2019_90075091","Santos, Rui; Duque-Nunez, Natalia; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Martins, Marcio; Rita Carrasco, A.; Veiga-Pires, Cristina"

This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

Description of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic constituents of coastal wetland systems is a prerequisite for the establishment of long-term monitoring programs and a first step in elucidating their functional role in the landscape; both of particular significance to management. Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment. Gasteropoda, bivalvia and schaphopoda were found in higher abundances at sea and sea-influenced stations, which gradually decreased towards the land. On the other hand, insecta appeared at stations further away from the shore and their abundance progressively increased towards land. Gasteropoda and insecta were the taxa responsible for the identification of at least three clusters of stations across all five coastal systems studied. Two clusters contained clearly ""terrestrially-influenced"" or ""sea-influenced"" stations while intermediate clusters contained stations with varying degree of salt influence.4 - Distribution and abundance of gasteropoda and insecta, however, were found to be directly related to nutrient status and not to electrical conductivity of substratum.",NA,NA,"Dikou_2008_90074400","Dikou, A.; Dinapoya, V.; Evaggelatou, K.; Lambrianidis, E.; Troumbis, A."

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4","Santos_2019_90075091","Santos, Rui; Duque-Nunez, Natalia; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Martins, Marcio; Rita Carrasco, A.; Veiga-Pires, Cristina"

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266","Hansen_2017_90075284","Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

Description of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic constituents of coastal wetland systems is a prerequisite for the establishment of long-term monitoring programs and a first step in elucidating their functional role in the landscape; both of particular significance to management. Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment. Gasteropoda, bivalvia and schaphopoda were found in higher abundances at sea and sea-influenced stations, which gradually decreased towards the land. On the other hand, insecta appeared at stations further away from the shore and their abundance progressively increased towards land. Gasteropoda and insecta were the taxa responsible for the identification of at least three clusters of stations across all five coastal systems studied. Two clusters contained clearly ""terrestrially-influenced"" or ""sea-influenced"" stations while intermediate clusters contained stations with varying degree of salt influence.4 - Distribution and abundance of gasteropoda and insecta, however, were found to be directly related to nutrient status and not to electrical conductivity of substratum.",NA,NA,"Dikou_2008_90074400","Dikou, A.; Dinapoya, V.; Evaggelatou, K.; Lambrianidis, E.; Troumbis, A."

Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

The Cores CB and ZR, collected from the upper middle estuarine environment, showed higher values of finer fractions and total organic carbon as well as metals (except of Ca) than Core ZA, which was sampled from the lower estuarine environment. The concentration of trace metals including Mn and Fe was found to be largely dependent on the proximity to mining areas, with Core ZR and Core CB representing the highest metal concentrations (Mn, Fe, Cr, and Zn). Absence of a significant early diagenetic remobilization might have preserved the metal loadings due to mining and industrial activities in Cores ZR and CB. In Core ZA, all the elements except Cu showed significant enrichment in the upper portion. Enrichment factor computed in all the cores was found to be above 2 for all the studied metals except Zn, which suggests a high degree of metal contamination.

The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.","10.1007/s10750-005-1114-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29444447285&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-005-1114-4&partnerID=40&md5=49f44b238f7baa8c12d0eefbce74b1c0","Lillebø_2006_90074363","Lillebø, A.I.; Flindt, M.R.; Pardal, M.A.; Marques, J.C."

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9","Ferronato_2019_90075415","Ferronato, Chiara; Marinari, Sara; Francioso, Ornella; Bello, Diana; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Antisari, Livia Vittori"

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.","10.3389/fevo.2019.00151","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066803382&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2019.151&partnerID=40&md5=0f06be611f1086b7e4c91f364cc0fc22","Harvey_2019_90074544","Harvey, Rachel J.; Garbutt, Angus; Hawkins, Stephen J.; Skov, Martin W."

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105275","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103244945&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105275&partnerID=40&md5=b9dd6a3562f60f8b6afc9b4eeb48c8e5","Pollmann_2021_90074441","Pollmann, Thomas; Boettcher, Michael E.; Giani, Luise"

To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

A.","author_04","Impact of cattle grazing on temperate coastal salt marsh soils","Over the last two decades, grazing intensity has increased in the temperate salt marshes of Samborombon Bay (Argentina) due to agricultural expansion and the displacement of domestic livestock to these areas. We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9","Di Bella_2015_90074813","Di Bella, C.

Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.","10.1111/ejss.12739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057766567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12739&partnerID=40&md5=4df28dfc6b1509fbc8f6f40a93ef5c62","Van de Broek_2019_90074605","Van de Broek, M.; Baert, L.; Temmerman, S.; Govers, G."

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266","Hansen_2017_90075284","Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.","10.3389/fevo.2019.00151","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066803382&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2019.151&partnerID=40&md5=0f06be611f1086b7e4c91f364cc0fc22","Harvey_2019_90074544","Harvey, Rachel J.; Garbutt, Angus; Hawkins, Stephen J.; Skov, Martin W."

However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.","10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b","Luis Marin-Muniz_2014_90074521","Luis Marin-Muniz, Jose; Hernandez, Maria E.; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries.

Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages.

The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem.

We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9","Di Bella_2015_90074813","Di Bella, C.

The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes. The findings confirm that the high organic matter content of ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes is associated with distinct vegetation composition.","10.1007/s12237-012-9579-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876830531&doi=10.1007%2fs12237-012-9579-7&partnerID=40&md5=bf816f5125437df91d0b32b5a8c17a7a","Cott_2013_90074670","Cott, Grace M.; Chapman, Deborah V.; Jansen, Marcel A.

The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.","10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00251.x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031806163&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2745.1998.00251.x&partnerID=40&md5=dcc358977cbe58d9c880e6c0b1d5ef3c","Morris_1998_90075070","Morris, J.T.; Jensen, A."

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266","Hansen_2017_90075284","Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.","10.3389/fmars.2020.00380","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087041053&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2020.00380&partnerID=40&md5=c822f25c2cc321f74241068202974a92","Bulmer_2020_90075388","Bulmer, Richard Hugh; Stephenson, Fabrice; Jones, Hannah F.

The aim of this study was to establish the soil-geomorphology relationship in Fracasso salt marsh and to determine the successional vegetation dynamics associated with the landscape evolution. This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.","10.1016/j.jsames.2018.04.015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046100223&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsames.2018.04.015&partnerID=40&md5=51f948fee42121cf3f388041d6fbf014","Rios_2018_90074686","Rios, Ileana; Jose Bouza, Pablo; Bortolus, Alejandro; del Pilar Alvarez, Maria"

L.","author_02","A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit","Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.","10.1023/A:1009731808445","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031395824&doi=10.1023%2fa%3a1009731808445&partnerID=40&md5=75bd307ee63d8e3eeda01ba99f1d4a6a","Ping_1997_90075097","Ping, C.L.; Michaelson, G.J.; Kimble, J.M."

This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment.

One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ""blue carbon ecosystems"" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.","10.1002/lno.12011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122708409&doi=10.1002%2flno.12011&partnerID=40&md5=d81ebb481a511605d40a7fd7aa1ec32d","Graversen_2022_90075208","Graversen, Anna Elizabeth Lovgren; Banta, Gary T.; Masque, Pere; Krause-Jensen, Dorte"

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink.

Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment.

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh.

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

A.","author_10","Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf","Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9","Ferronato_2019_90075415","Ferronato, Chiara; Marinari, Sara; Francioso, Ornella; Bello, Diana; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Antisari, Livia Vittori"

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.","10.1007/s10750-005-1114-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29444447285&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-005-1114-4&partnerID=40&md5=49f44b238f7baa8c12d0eefbce74b1c0","Lillebø_2006_90074363","Lillebø, A.I.; Flindt, M.R.; Pardal, M.A.; Marques, J.C."

A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%).

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models.

While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates.

Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context.

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.","10.1023/A:1009731808445","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031395824&doi=10.1023%2fa%3a1009731808445&partnerID=40&md5=75bd307ee63d8e3eeda01ba99f1d4a6a","Ping_1997_90075097","Ping, C.L.; Michaelson, G.J.; Kimble, J.M."

However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.","10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b","Luis Marin-Muniz_2014_90074521","Luis Marin-Muniz, Jose; Hernandez, Maria E.; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved. The results of this study should be considered in the development of strategies for the management and conservation of these tropical ecosystems, as a means to achieve sustainable livestock farming in wetlands.","10.1071/SR13037","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883588860&doi=10.1071%2fSR13037&partnerID=40&md5=427694db7749368a5c1b623c01c320c7","Rodriguez-Medina_2013_90074812","Rodriguez-Medina, Karla; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

The concentration of trace metals including Mn and Fe was found to be largely dependent on the proximity to mining areas, with Core ZR and Core CB representing the highest metal concentrations (Mn, Fe, Cr, and Zn). Absence of a significant early diagenetic remobilization might have preserved the metal loadings due to mining and industrial activities in Cores ZR and CB. In Core ZA, all the elements except Cu showed significant enrichment in the upper portion. Enrichment factor computed in all the cores was found to be above 2 for all the studied metals except Zn, which suggests a high degree of metal contamination.

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.","10.1002/ecs2.2556","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010","Mueller_2019_90074609","Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"

Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.","10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a","Ferreira_2013_90074595","Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.","10.1007/s10750-005-1114-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29444447285&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-005-1114-4&partnerID=40&md5=49f44b238f7baa8c12d0eefbce74b1c0","Lillebø_2006_90074363","Lillebø, A.I.; Flindt, M.R.; Pardal, M.A.; Marques, J.C."

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city.

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C.

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6","Vitti_2020_90074914","Vitti, Stefano; Pellegrini, Elisa; Casolo, Valentino; Trotta, Giacomo; Boscutti, Francesco"

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates.

The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh.

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary.

Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.","10.1016/j.catena.2019.104331","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075738729&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104331&partnerID=40&md5=c3a335e0547ccf13f141aefab6260433","Gispert_2020_90074897","Gispert, Maria; Phang, Chantha; Carrasco-Barea, Lorena"

In order to characterize the marshes of the south of Santa Cruz, identify the main vegetal assemblages and analyze the variations of the vegetal biomass in relation to the tidal level and the time of the year, three samplings were carried out in spring (November 2015), summer (February 2016) and winter (August 2016) in San Julian Bay and the estuaries of the Santa Cruz, Coyle and Gallegos rivers. The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh. Spartina sp. was found only in the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, site that constitutes the southernmost record for this halophyte on the Argentina coast.","10.22305/ict-unpa.v11i1.778",NA,"Martin_2019_90074750","Martin, J.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4","Santos_2019_90075091","Santos, Rui; Duque-Nunez, Natalia; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Martins, Marcio; Rita Carrasco, A.; Veiga-Pires, Cristina"

We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9","Di Bella_2015_90074813","Di Bella, C.

Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models.

The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh.

Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1).

Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.","10.1002/ecs2.2556","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010","Mueller_2019_90074609","Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.","10.3389/fevo.2019.00151","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066803382&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2019.151&partnerID=40&md5=0f06be611f1086b7e4c91f364cc0fc22","Harvey_2019_90074544","Harvey, Rachel J.; Garbutt, Angus; Hawkins, Stephen J.; Skov, Martin W."

We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9","Di Bella_2015_90074813","Di Bella, C.

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.","10.1111/ejss.12739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057766567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12739&partnerID=40&md5=4df28dfc6b1509fbc8f6f40a93ef5c62","Van de Broek_2019_90074605","Van de Broek, M.; Baert, L.; Temmerman, S.; Govers, G."

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems.

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6","Vitti_2020_90074914","Vitti, Stefano; Pellegrini, Elisa; Casolo, Valentino; Trotta, Giacomo; Boscutti, Francesco"

Description of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic constituents of coastal wetland systems is a prerequisite for the establishment of long-term monitoring programs and a first step in elucidating their functional role in the landscape; both of particular significance to management. Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment. Gasteropoda, bivalvia and schaphopoda were found in higher abundances at sea and sea-influenced stations, which gradually decreased towards the land. On the other hand, insecta appeared at stations further away from the shore and their abundance progressively increased towards land. Gasteropoda and insecta were the taxa responsible for the identification of at least three clusters of stations across all five coastal systems studied. Two clusters contained clearly ""terrestrially-influenced"" or ""sea-influenced"" stations while intermediate clusters contained stations with varying degree of salt influence.4 - Distribution and abundance of gasteropoda and insecta, however, were found to be directly related to nutrient status and not to electrical conductivity of substratum.",NA,NA,"Dikou_2008_90074400","Dikou, A.; Dinapoya, V.; Evaggelatou, K.; Lambrianidis, E.; Troumbis, A."

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.","10.1007/s10021-021-00660-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108615887&doi=10.1007%2fs10021-021-00660-6&partnerID=40&md5=3c98333d69e7f9089f95a1f2e2d667bb","Martins_2021_90074438","Martins, Marcio; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Masque, Pere; Carrasco, A.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4","Santos_2019_90075091","Santos, Rui; Duque-Nunez, Natalia; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Martins, Marcio; Rita Carrasco, A.; Veiga-Pires, Cristina"

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink.

Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.","10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a","Ferreira_2013_90074595","Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis.

The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city.

The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city.

However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.","10.3389/fmars.2020.00380","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087041053&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2020.00380&partnerID=40&md5=c822f25c2cc321f74241068202974a92","Bulmer_2020_90075388","Bulmer, Richard Hugh; Stephenson, Fabrice; Jones, Hannah F.

However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ""reclaimed,"" that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.","10.1029/2000GB001346","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035693360&doi=10.1029%2f2000GB001346&partnerID=40&md5=f05816b803c4320bb6abab7804d776eb","Connor_2001_90074694","Connor, R.F.; Chmura, G.L.; Beecher, C.B."

The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes.

However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103215","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088050165&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloplacha.2020.103215&partnerID=40&md5=3102ec71c0247e6f636d6c39269a0a0f","Cuellar-Martinez_2020_90074927","Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia; Guadalupe Lopez-Mendoza, Perla; Carnero-Bravo, Vladislav; Maricusa Agraz-Hernandez, Claudia; Ine van Tussenbroek, Brigitta; Sandoval-Gil, Jose; Gilberto Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose; Vazquez-Molina, Yosahandy; Aldana-Gutierrez, Giovanni"

The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates.

These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.","10.1088/1748-9326/aac899","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056519139&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2faac899&partnerID=40&md5=e284de9bf6bc747f71aaa108886cd933","Cusack_2018_90074668","Cusack, M.; Saderne, V.; Arias-Ortiz, A.; Masque, P.; Krishnakumar, P.

E.","author_01","Impact of cattle grazing on temperate coastal salt marsh soils","Over the last two decades, grazing intensity has increased in the temperate salt marshes of Samborombon Bay (Argentina) due to agricultural expansion and the displacement of domestic livestock to these areas. We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.","10.1111/sum.12176","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929953645&doi=10.1111%2fsum.12176&partnerID=40&md5=27820e465fa7da483cd2c0b12b0390c9","Di Bella_2015_90074813","Di Bella, C.

Description of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic constituents of coastal wetland systems is a prerequisite for the establishment of long-term monitoring programs and a first step in elucidating their functional role in the landscape; both of particular significance to management. Spatial variability of water and substratum physicochemical variables and of substratum macroinvertebrate fauna composition and abundance across five sea-coastal wetland-land systems, Kalloni bay, Lesvos Island, Greece, were quantified during the growing season of 2005. 2 - The studied coastal wetlands develop on an alluvial flat plain of mineral soils as indicated by low values of percent organic matter, circumneutral pH, and high values of bulk density. Trends in physicochemical variables of substratum varied among the five coastal wetland systems studied even when the same variable was examined. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the most important substratum physicochemical variable in differentiating among the sea-wetland-land units of the studied gradients was electrical conductivity (salt influence) in four out of the five coastal wetland systems. Total nitrogen concentration of substratum was the only variable among the ones studied which was related positively either with total phosphorus concentration or/and percent organic matter of substratum in all wetland systems studied; the highest values occurred where vegetation was present. 3 - Distribution and abundance of substratum macroinvertebrate taxa across the sea-wetland-land gradients studied reflected the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environment. Gasteropoda, bivalvia and schaphopoda were found in higher abundances at sea and sea-influenced stations, which gradually decreased towards the land. On the other hand, insecta appeared at stations further away from the shore and their abundance progressively increased towards land. Gasteropoda and insecta were the taxa responsible for the identification of at least three clusters of stations across all five coastal systems studied. Two clusters contained clearly ""terrestrially-influenced"" or ""sea-influenced"" stations while intermediate clusters contained stations with varying degree of salt influence.4 - Distribution and abundance of gasteropoda and insecta, however, were found to be directly related to nutrient status and not to electrical conductivity of substratum.",NA,NA,"Dikou_2008_90074400","Dikou, A.; Dinapoya, V.; Evaggelatou, K.; Lambrianidis, E.; Troumbis, A."

Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.","10.1007/s11368-012-0607-9","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872854631&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-012-0607-9&partnerID=40&md5=125a3a73864acf8cd600b84b0255f10a","Ferreira_2013_90074595","Ferreira, Fernando Perobelli; Vidal-Torrado, Pablo; Otero, Xose L.; Buurman, Peter; Martin-Neto, Ladislau; Boluda, Rafael; Macias, Felipe"

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058501543&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2018.12.019&partnerID=40&md5=c33986307b7062a49ba31f07079917f9","Ferronato_2019_90075415","Ferronato, Chiara; Marinari, Sara; Francioso, Ornella; Bello, Diana; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Antisari, Livia Vittori"

This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment.

Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.","10.1016/j.catena.2019.104331","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075738729&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2019.104331&partnerID=40&md5=c3a335e0547ccf13f141aefab6260433","Gispert_2020_90074897","Gispert, Maria; Phang, Chantha; Carrasco-Barea, Lorena"

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.","10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107240","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101168187&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecss.2021.107240&partnerID=40&md5=9fca23eaef2474ce3ac52c3d7c137c6d","Gispert_2021_90075190","Gispert, Maria; Kuliush, Tetiana; Dyachenko, Lina; Kharytonov, Mykola; Emran, Mohamed; Verdaguer, Dolors; Llorens, Laura; Carrasco-Barea, Lorena"

We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ""blue carbon ecosystems"" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.","10.1002/lno.12011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122708409&doi=10.1002%2flno.12011&partnerID=40&md5=d81ebb481a511605d40a7fd7aa1ec32d","Graversen_2022_90075208","Graversen, Anna Elizabeth Lovgren; Banta, Gary T.; Masque, Pere; Krause-Jensen, Dorte"

However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.","10.1007/s11368-016-1500-8","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978147680&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-016-1500-8&partnerID=40&md5=1515e21fa662bb303deead90c66d2266","Hansen_2017_90075284","Hansen, Kerstin; Butzeck, Christian; Eschenbach, Annette; Groengroeft, Alexander; Jensen, Kai; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria"

We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ""blue carbon"" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts.

The objective of the research was to determine sedimentary environments of the soil organic matter based on selected properties. The obtained results indicated that despite similar morphological characteristics, these soils might have developed in slightly different environmental conditions, determined mostly by the Baltic water levels and morphology of the coast. The organic matter of the studied soils was characterised by relatively low aromaticity, which may indicate the ongoing process of decomposition. The presence of both peat-bog, rush and ruderal plants, as well as trees in the species composition of macroremains proved the heterogeneity of sedimentary environments and confirmed the allochthonous origin of organic matter accumulated in the studied brackish marsh soils.","10.2478/v10090-012-0009-z","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999042364&doi=10.2478%2fv10090-012-0009-z&partnerID=40&md5=8737e77b200a5913afd4b1e23973482a","Hulisz_2012_90074281","Hulisz, Piotr; Krzeslak, Iwona; Karasiewicz, Miroslaw T."

Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh.

The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city.

The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.","10.1007/s10750-005-1114-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29444447285&doi=10.1007%2fs10750-005-1114-4&partnerID=40&md5=49f44b238f7baa8c12d0eefbce74b1c0","Lillebø_2006_90074363","Lillebø, A.I.; Flindt, M.R.; Pardal, M.A.; Marques, J.C."

However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.","10.1007/s11104-013-2011-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898861529&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-013-2011-7&partnerID=40&md5=72ee4786a0d6516568414fe94670970b","Luis Marin-Muniz_2014_90074521","Luis Marin-Muniz, Jose; Hernandez, Maria E.; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%.

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models.

The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.","10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00251.x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031806163&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2745.1998.00251.x&partnerID=40&md5=dcc358977cbe58d9c880e6c0b1d5ef3c","Morris_1998_90075070","Morris, J.T.; Jensen, A."
"JOUR",90074609,"2019"," Europe","Mueller, Peter","author_01","Assessing the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of the semi-natural salt marshes in the European Wadden Sea","Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.","10.1002/ecs2.2556","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061060622&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2556&partnerID=40&md5=fd074e8b70ee826b9c5450570935b010","Mueller_2019_90074609","Mueller, Peter; Ladiges, Nils; Jack, Alexander; Schmiedl, Gerhard; Kutzbach, Lars; Jensen, Kai; Nolte, Stefanie"

The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.","10.1023/A:1009731808445","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031395824&doi=10.1023%2fa%3a1009731808445&partnerID=40&md5=75bd307ee63d8e3eeda01ba99f1d4a6a","Ping_1997_90075097","Ping, C.L.; Michaelson, G.J.; Kimble, J.M."

This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.","10.1016/j.catena.2021.105275","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103244945&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2021.105275&partnerID=40&md5=b9dd6a3562f60f8b6afc9b4eeb48c8e5","Pollmann_2021_90074441","Pollmann, Thomas; Boettcher, Michael E.; Giani, Luise"

L.","author_01","A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit","Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to establish the soil-geomorphology relationship in Fracasso salt marsh and to determine the successional vegetation dynamics associated with the landscape evolution. This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.","10.1016/j.jsames.2018.04.015","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046100223&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsames.2018.04.015&partnerID=40&md5=51f948fee42121cf3f388041d6fbf014","Rios_2018_90074686","Rios, Ileana; Jose Bouza, Pablo; Bortolus, Alejandro; del Pilar Alvarez, Maria"

On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved. The results of this study should be considered in the development of strategies for the management and conservation of these tropical ecosystems, as a means to achieve sustainable livestock farming in wetlands.","10.1071/SR13037","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883588860&doi=10.1071%2fSR13037&partnerID=40&md5=427694db7749368a5c1b623c01c320c7","Rodriguez-Medina_2013_90074812","Rodriguez-Medina, Karla; Moreno-Casasola, Patricia"

Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.","10.1038/s41598-018-37031-6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060548873&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-37031-6&partnerID=40&md5=221556baf25c907196ca2ed54d7794a4","Santos_2019_90075091","Santos, Rui; Duque-Nunez, Natalia; de los Santos, Carmen B.; Martins, Marcio; Rita Carrasco, A.; Veiga-Pires, Cristina"

Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis.

The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself.

The objective of this work was to assess C, N and P stocks of Spartina maritima (low marsh pioneer halophyte) and Juncus maritimus (representative of mid-high marsh halophytes) combined with the contribution of Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia perennis, and Bolbochenous maritimus to the lagoon approximate to 4400 ha marsh area. A multivariate analysis (PCO), taking into account environmental variables and the annual biomass and nutrient dynamics, showed that there are no clear seasonal or spatial differences within low or mid-high marshes, but clearly separates J. maritimus and S. maritima marshes. Calculations of C, N and P stocks in the biomass of the five most representative halophytes plus the respective rhizosediment (25 cm depth), and taking into account their relative coverage, represents 252053 Mg C, 38100 Mg N and 7563 Mg P. Over 90% of the stocks are found within mid-high marshes.

The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates. This study shows that monosaccharides are useful biomarkers to explore the origin of OM in coastal soils. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.","10.1029/2021JG006507","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119843116&doi=10.1029%2f2021JG006507&partnerID=40&md5=5fbd9fdcff79d19e2b7c8f59e1ec1885","van Ardenne_2021_90075194","van Ardenne, L.

Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.","10.1111/ejss.12739","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057766567&doi=10.1111%2fejss.12739&partnerID=40&md5=4df28dfc6b1509fbc8f6f40a93ef5c62","Van de Broek_2019_90074605","Van de Broek, M.; Baert, L.; Temmerman, S.; Govers, G."

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.","10.1093/jpe/rtaa052","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097187950&doi=10.1093%2fjpe%2frtaa052&partnerID=40&md5=46d0c511a7b57c105c5a84b9696412f6","Vitti_2020_90074914","Vitti, Stefano; Pellegrini, Elisa; Casolo, Valentino; Trotta, Giacomo; Boscutti, Francesco"

Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.","10.1016/j.csr.2021.104554","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117885070&doi=10.1016%2fj.csr.2021.104554&partnerID=40&md5=ba31b7a126b12dc6018d0adb937dd33d","Voltz_2021_90074747","Voltz, B.; Denis, L.; Duong, G.; Santoni, A.-L.; Artigas, L.F.; Cornille, V.; Henry, F.; Mathieu, O.; Tallobre, C.; Gontharet, S."

Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores.Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.","10.1017/S0376892910000184","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952422314&doi=10.1017%2fS0376892910000184&partnerID=40&md5=350d1189b59a74e6740dea9dc8d28636","Yu_2009_90074324","Yu, O.
