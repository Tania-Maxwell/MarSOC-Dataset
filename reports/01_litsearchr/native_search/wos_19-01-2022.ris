AB  - To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (+/- 65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world. While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range. Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical dry forests.

AB  - Water and salinity regulation measures have been widely taken to restore the ecological structures and functions of degraded coastal wetlands. To investigate the effects of different water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands, soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in four types of wetlands (i.e., restored tidal salt marshes (RTSM, covered with Suaeda salsa) and degraded tidal salt marshes (DTSM, bare land); freshwater restored wetlands (FRW) and degraded wetlands without freshwater inputs (DWFI), covered with Phragmites australis) during the period from August to October in 2015 in the Yellow River Delta, China. Our results showed that the mean values of total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in restored wetlands (e.g., RTSM and FRW) than those in degraded wetlands (e.g., DTSM and DWFI). Along the whole soil profile, TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC were higher in RTSM soils than those in DTSM soils except for TC and SOC in the 0-10 cm soils and DOC in the 40-50 cm soils. FRW soils contained higher TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC than DWFI except for DOC in the 0-10 cm soils. Soil TC density (TCD), SOC density (SOCD), ROOC density (ROOCD) and DOC density (DOCD) in the top 50 cm soils in restored wetlands were higher compared with degraded wetlands. Multivariate analysis showed that soil carbon was significantly influenced by EC, soil base cations and anions (e.g., K+, Ca2+ Cl- and SO42-), pH, TN, C/N ratio, bulk density (BD) and soil texture (p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that these two water and salinity regulation measures are effective in increasing soil carbon stocks of coastal wetlands.

AB  - Freshwater marshes are prevalent in North America, yet their soil carbon stocks remain poorly quantified. To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50-100 years); these short-term rates are on average (+/- SD) 155 +/- 74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 +/- 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future.

AB  - Combined effects of vegetation, tide and sediment on the carbon dynamics in the intertidal creek-marsh systems remain unclear. We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks. Our results are helpful in reliable estimates of carbon transport between the coastal marsh and the adjacent ocean.

AB  - Tidal marshes rank among the ecosystems with the highest capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (C-org) on earth. To inform conservation of coastal vegetated ecosystems for climate change mitigation, this study investigated the factors driving variability in carbon storage. We estimated soil C(org)stocks in tidal marshes across temperate Western Australia and assessed differences among geomorphic settings (marine and fluvial deltas, and mid-estuary) and vegetation type (Sarcocornia quinquefloraandJuncus kraussii) linked to soil biogeochemistry. Soil C(org)stocks within fluvial and mid-estuary settings were significantly higher (209 +/- 14 and 211 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively; 1-m-thick soils) than in marine counterparts (156 +/- 12 Mg C-org ha(-1)), which can be partially explained by higher preservation of soil C(org)in fluvial and mid-estuary settings rich in fine-grained (< 0.063 mm) sediments (49 +/- 3% and 47 +/- 4%, respectively) compared to marine settings (23 +/- 4%). Soil C(org)stocks were not significantly different betweenS. quinquefloraandJ. kraussiimarshes (185 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 13 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively). The higher contribution of tidal marsh plus supratidal vegetation in fluvial (80%) and intermediate (76%) compared to marine (57%) settings further explains differences in soil C(org)stocks. The estimated soil C(org)stocks in temperate Western Australia's tidal marshes (57 Tg C(org)within similar to 3000 km(2)extent) correspond to about 2% of worldwide tidal marsh soil C(org)stocks. The results obtained identify global drivers of soil C(org)storage in tidal marshes and can be used to target hot spots for climate change mitigation based on tidal marsh conservation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in global carbon sequestration, and exotic S. alterniflora affects the coastal ecosystem's functions including SOC storage (SOCS). We investigated the vertical deep soil SOC distribution (0-300 cm) in Jiangsu salt marsh and estimated its changes. The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora. The deepest SOC distribution (180 cm) and the highest SOC content (2.14 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1)) in the deep layer( 50-300 cm) were found in the zones where S. salsa - S. alterniflora co-exist (SSI). The vertical SOC distribution in zones where multi-species co-exists is deeper than that in mono-species dominated zones; (2) The deep soil (100-300 cm) SOC accounts more than 50% of 0-300 cm SOC in Jiangsu salt marsh, suggesting that SOC content of deep soil should not be ignored when calculating the global soil carbon stock; (3) Total SOCS within 0-300 cm in Jiangsu salt marshes (107.84 x 10(6) m(2)) is 84.90 x 10(10) g, of which 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm and 200-300 cm layer accounts for 38.25%, 30.72% and 31.03%, respectively. The size of the SOCS (0-300 cm) in the Jiangsu salt marshes relatively to the global biome (0.36 x 10(-6)) is in a lower proportion of the range of salt marsh area to global biome area (0.89 x 10(-6)). The S. alterniflora salt marsh contributes most of the SOCS in the 0-300 cm and 0-100 cm soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.

AB  - Estuarine salt marshes have been recognized as one of the most efficient carbon sinks in the biosphere, with considerable potential for climate change mitigation. However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are carbon and nutrient sinks that capture large amounts of atmospheric CO2 and runoff of nutrients. 'Blue carbon' refers to carbon stored within resident vegetation (e.g. mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) and soil of coastal wetlands. This study aimed to quantify the impact of vegetation type on soil carbon stocks (organic and inorganic) and nitrogen in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of mangroves and tidal marsh habitats within nine temperate coastal blue carbon wetlands in South Australia. Results showed differences in surface soil organic carbon stocks (18.4 Mg OC ha(-1) for mangroves; 17.6 Mg OC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), inorganic carbon (31.9 Mg IC ha(-1) for mangroves; 35.1 Mg IC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), and total nitrogen (1.8 Mg TN ha(-1) for both) were not consistently driven by vegetation type. However, mangrove soils at two sites (Clinton and Port Augusta) and tidal marsh soils at one site (Torrens Island) had larger soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. These results highlighted site-specific differences in blue carbon stocks between the vegetation types and spatial variability within sites. Further, differences in spatial distribution of SOC within sites corresponded with variations in soil bulk density (BD). Results highlighted a link between SOC and BD in blue carbon soils. Understanding the drivers of carbon and nitrogen storage across different blue carbon environments and capturing its spatial variability will help improve predictions of the contribution these ecosystems to climate change mitigation.

AB  - The protection of organic carbon stored in forests is considered as an important method for mitigating climate change. Like terrestrial ecosystems, coastal ecosystems store large amounts of carbon, and there are initiatives to protect these 'blue carbon' stores. Organic carbon stocks in tidal salt marshes and mangroves have been estimated, but uncertainties in the stores of seagrass meadows-some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth-hinder the application of marine carbon conservation schemes. Here, we compile published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass biomass and underlying soils in 946 distinct seagrass meadows across the globe. Using only data from sites for which full inventories exist, we estimate that, globally, seagrass ecosystems could store as much as 19.9 Pg organic carbon; according to a more conservative approach, in which we incorporate more data from surface soils and depth-dependent declines in soil carbon stocks, we estimate that the seagrass carbon pool lies between 4.2 and 8.4 Pg carbon. We estimate that present rates of seagrass loss could result in the release of up to 299 Tg carbon per year, assuming that all of the organic carbon in seagrass biomass and the top metre of soils is remineralized.

AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9%-13% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4%-6% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5%-1.4% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

AB  - Tidal wetlands produce long-term soil organic carbon (C) stocks. Thus for carbon accounting purposes, we need accurate and precise information on the magnitude and spatial distribution of those stocks. We assembled and analyzed an unprecedented soil core dataset, and tested three strategies for mapping carbon stocks: applying the average value from the synthesis to mapped tidal wetlands, applying models fit using empirical data and applied using soil, vegetation and salinity maps, and relying on independently generated soil carbon maps. Soil carbon stocks were far lower on average and varied less spatially and with depth than stocks calculated from available soils maps. Further, variation in carbon density was not well-predicted based on climate, salinity, vegetation, or soil classes. Instead, the assembled dataset showed that carbon density across the conterminous united states (CON US) was normally distributed, with a predictable range of observations. We identified the simplest strategy, applying mean carbon density (27.0 kg C m -3 ), as the best performing strategy, and conservatively estimated that the top meter of CONUS tidal wetland soil contains 0.72 petagrams C. This strategy could provide standardization in CONUS tidal carbon accounting until such a time as modeling and mapping advancements can quantitatively improve accuracy and precision.

AB  - Tidal marsh ecosystems are among earth's most efficient natural organic carbon (C) sinks and provide myriad ecosystem services. However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

AB  - BackgroundPlants play a pivotal role in soil stabilization, with above-ground vegetation and roots combining to physically protect soil against erosion. It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.
   QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.
   MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.
   Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.
   ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity. Diversity effects are more pronounced in biogeographical contexts where soils are erosion-prone (sandy, low organic content), suggesting that the pervasive influence of biodiversity on environmental processes also applies to the ecosystem service of erosion protection.

AB  - Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal "blue carbon" habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal and estuarine ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.

AB  - The relationship between methane emissions and salinity is not well understood in tidal marshes, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of marsh conservation and restoration on greenhouse gas balance. We used published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity > 18) had significantly lower methane emissions (mean +/- sd = 1 +/- 2 gm(-2) yr(-1)) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in methane emissions from fresh (salinity=0-0.5) and mesohaline (5-18) marshes (42 +/- 76 and 16 +/- 11 gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while oligohaline (0.5-5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane emissions (150 +/- 221 gm(-2) yr(-1)). Annual methane emissions were modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane flux (log(CH4) - -0.056 x salinity + 1: 38; r(2) = 0.52; p < 0.0001). Managers interested in using marshes as greenhouse gas sinks can assume negligible methane emissions in polyhaline systems, but need to estimate or monitor methane emissions in lower-salinity marshes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.
   In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores.
   Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala has been widely used to increase the mangrove area in China. Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.

AB  - Soil properties and soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from four coastal wetlands were studied throughout the year, namely, native Kandelia obovata mangrove forest vs. exotic Sonneratia apetala mangrove forest, and native Cyperus malaccensis salt marsh vs. exotic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Soils of the four wetlands were all net sources of greenhouse gases while Sonneratia forest contributed the most with a total soil-atmosphere CO2-equivalent flux of 137.27 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), which is 69.23%, 99.75% and 44.56% higher than that of Kandelia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively. The high underground biomass and distinctive root structure of Sonneratia might be responsible for its high greenhouse gas emission from the soil. Soils in Spartina marsh emitted the second largest amount of total greenhouse gases but it ranked first in emitting trace greenhouse gases. Annual average CH4 and N2O fluxes from Spartina soil were 13.77 and 1.14 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which are 2.08 and 1.46 times that of Kandelia, 1.03 and 1.15 times of Sonneratia, and 1.74 and 1.02 times of Cyperus, respectively. Spartina has longer growing season and higher productivity than native marshes which might increase greenhouse gas emission in cold seasons. Exotic wetland soils had higher carbon stock as compared to their respective native counterparts but their carbon stocks were offset by a larger proportion because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions. Annual total soil-atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases reduced soil carbon burial benefits by 8.1%, 9.5%, 6.4% and 7.2% for Kandelia, Sonneratia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively, which narrowed down the gaps in net soil carbon stock between native and exotic wetlands. The results indicated that the invasion of exotic wetland plants might convert local coastal soils into a considerable atmospheric source of greenhouse gases although they at the same time increase soil carbon accumulation.

AB  - In peatlands, bacterial tyrosinases (TYRs) are proposed to act as key regulators of carbon storage by removing phenolic compounds, which inhibit the degradation of organic carbon. Historically, TYR activity has been blocked by anoxia resulting from persistent waterlogging; however, recent events of prolonged summer drought have boosted TYR activity and, consequently, the release of carbon stored in the form of organic compounds from peatlands. Since 30% of the global soil carbon stock is stored in peatlands, a profound understanding of the production and activity of TYRs is essential to assess the impact of carbon dioxide emitted from peatlands on climate change. TYR partial sequences identified by degenerated primers suggest a versatile TYR enzyme community naturally present in peatlands, which is produced by a phylogenetically diverse spectrum of bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. One full-length sequence of an extracellular TYR (SzTYR) identified from a soda-rich inland salt marsh has been heterologously expressed and purified. SzTYR exhibits a molecular mass of 30 891.8 Da and shows a pH optimum of 9.0. Spectroscopic studies and kinetic investigations characterized SzTYR as a tyrosinase and proved its activity toward monophenols (coumaric acid), diphenols (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid), and triphenols (gallic acid) naturally present in peatlands.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from land-derived eutrophication in most developed coastlines worldwide. Here, we tested for 277 days the effects of a nutrient pulse on blue carbon retention and cycling within an Australian temperate coastal system. After 56 days of exposure, saltmarsh and mangrove plots subject to a high-nutrient treatment (-20 g N m? 2 yr? 1 and -2 g P m? 2 yr? 1) had -23% lower superficial soil carbon stocks. Mangrove plots also experienced a -33% reduction in the microbe Amplicon Sequence Variant richness and a shift in community structure linked to elevated ammonium concentrations. Live plant cover, tea litter decomposition, and soil carbon fluxes (CO2 and CH4) were not significantly affected by the pulse. Before the end of the experiment, soil carbon- and nitrogen-cycling had returned to control levels, highlighting the significant but short-lived impact that a nutrient pulse can have on the carbon sink capacity of coastal wetlands.

AB  - We periodically measured soil properties (bulk density, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) in a tidal salt marsh constructed in 1970 over the past five decades (1984, 1995, 1998, 2017) to identify trajectories of soil formation over time. Bulk density was greater in surface (0-10 cm) than subsurface (10-30 cm) soils and decreased with time at a similar rate in both depths. Percent organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) increased with time, with concentrations in surface soils increasing three times faster than subsurface soils. Surface C and N pools (g/m(2), 0-10 cm) exhibited asymptotic trajectories with time, with rapid accumulation in the first two decades that began to equilibrate after 25 years, while subsurface pools of C and N continued to increase in a linear manner. Soil P pools did not exhibit a significant trend related to marsh age. Soil N: P increased in both depths over time, suggesting gradual relaxation of N-limitation of these systems. Our findings can help restoration ecologists identify soil properties, including bulk density, C, N, and C: N suitable for gauging restoration success and better estimate the time frame necessary for recovery of soil-based ecosystem services.

AB  - Australia's tidal marshes have suffered significant losses but their recently recognised importance in CO2 sequestration is creating opportunities for their protection and restoration. We compiled all available data on soil organic carbon (OC) storage in Australia's tidal marshes (323 cores). OC stocks in the surface 1 m averaged 165.41 (SE 6.96) Mg OC ha(-1) (range 14-963 Mg OC ha(-1)). The mean OC accumulation rate was 0.55 +/- 0.02 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1). Geomorphology was the most important predictor of OC stocks, with fluvial sites having twice the stock of OC as seaward sites. Australia's 1.4 million hectares of tidal marshes contain an estimated 212 million tonnes of OC in the surface 1 m, with a potential CO2-equivalent value of $USD7.19 billion. Annual sequestration is 0.75 Tg OC yr(-1), with a CO2-equivalent value of $ USD28.02 million per annum. This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of tidal marsh blue carbon in Australia, and illustrates their importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. We outline potential further development of carbon offset schemes to restore the sequestration capacity and other ecosystem services provided by Australia tidal marshes.

AB  - Ecotone dynamics and shifting range limits can be used to advance our understanding of the ecological implications of future range expansions in response to climate change. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone is an area where range limits and ecotone dynamics can be studied in tandem as recent decreases in winter temperature extremes have allowed for mangrove expansion at the expense of salt marsh. In this study, we assessed aboveground and belowground plant-soil dynamics across the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone quantifying micro-spatial patterns in horizontal extent. Specifically, we studied vegetation and rooting dynamics of large and small trees, the impact of salt marshes (e.g. species and structure) on mangroves, and the influence of vegetation on soil properties along transects from underneath the mangrove canopy into the surrounding salt marsh. Vegetation and rooting dynamics differed in horizontal reach, and there was a positive relationship between mangrove tree height and rooting extent. We found that the horizontal expansion of mangrove roots into salt marsh extended up to eight meters beyond the aboveground boundary. Variation in vegetation structure and local hydrology appear to control mangrove seedling dynamics. Finally, soil carbon density and organic matter did not differ within locations across the salt marsh-mangrove interface. By studying aboveground and belowground variation across the ecotone, we can better predict the ecological effects of continued range expansion in response to climate change.

AB  - We report the results of a 5-year fertilization experiment in a central Long Island Sound salt marsh, aimed at understanding the impacts of high nutrient loads on marsh elevational processes. Fertilization with nitrogen led to some significant changes in marsh processes, specifically increases in aboveground primary production and in CO2 fluxes from the soil. However, neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss (relative to controls), reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production, all of which have been proposed as links between elevated nutrient loads and marsh drowning. Our data suggest that high nutrient levels increase gross carbon loss from the sediment, but that this is compensated for by other processes, leading to no net deleterious effect of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability with respect to sea level rise.

AB  - Production of belowground organic matter is critical to sustainability of salt marshes. It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.

AB  - The distribution of carbon (C) within a salt marsh may vary among vegetation zones depending on production and decomposition dynamics and organic and mineral depositional history. We examined spatial and temporal variation of plant and soil C pools within a salt marsh fringing a coastal lagoon along the mid-Atlantic coast of the U. S. The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas. Belowground C pool loss was 36% less for S. patens than S. alterniflora and was similar between S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus. Accretion and C accumulation rates were greater in the S. alterniflora-dominated stand than in the J. roemerianus-dominated stand. Our results suggest that landward migration onto terrestrial soils can lead to an estimated 80% increase in belowground plant C composed primarily of fine roots and dlm and 36-70% increase in soil carbon between 15 and 30 cm depths.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

AB  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora accumulates organic carbon rapidly and can utilize a wide range of potential precursors for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production, as well as a wide variety of methanogenic substrates. Therefore, we predicted that S. alterniflora invasion would alter the relationships between DMS and methane (CH4) fluxes along the interacting gradients of tidal influence and vegetation, as well as the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4. In this study, we used static flux chambers to measure DMS and CH4 fluxes in August (growing season) and December (non-growing season) of 2013, along creek and vegetation transects in an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh. S. alterniflora invasion dramatically increased DMS and CH4 emission rates by 3.8-513.0 and 2.0-127.1 times the emission rates within non-vegetated regions and regions populated with native species, respectively, and significantly altered the spatial distribution of DMS and CH4 emissions. We also observed a substantial amount of variation in the DMS and CH4 fluxes along the elevation gradient in the salt marsh studied. A significant relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was observed, with the CH4 flux passively related to the DMS flux. The correlation between CH4 and DMS emissions along the vegetation transects was more significant than along the tidal creek. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, the relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was more significant than within any other salt marsh. Additionally, CH4 emissions within the S. alterniflora salt marsh were more sensitive to the variation in DMS emissions than within any other vegetation zone. The spatial variability in the relationship observed between DMS and CH4 fluxes appears to be at least partly due to the alteration of substrates involved in DMS and CH4 by S. alterniflora invasion. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, methanogenesis was more likely to be derived from noncompetitive substrates than competitive substrates, but within the creek and other vegetation zones, methanogenesis was inhibited by sulfate reduction. This suggests that methanogenesis and sulfate reduction were spatially isolated within the coastal salt marsh. Therefore, we conclude that the invasive S. alterniflora altered the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4 and the responses of the relationship between these two gases to interacting gradients of tidal inundation and vegetation within an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh.

AB  - 'Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53% in tidal marshes, 36% in seagrasses, and 11% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over $AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of $AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90% remineralization of stocks), 98% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

AB  - Coastal wetlands can sequester large amounts of organic carbon (OC), providing an additional motivation for the preservation and restoration of these ecosystems. In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence. This study has demonstrated that carbon storage in created coastal wetlands is correlated to wetland age, indicating that these ecosystems have the potential to become significant sources of OC storage.

AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

AB  - Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems. Despite growing understanding of factors controlling mangrove forest soil carbon stocks, there is a need to advance understanding of the speed of peat development beneath maturing mangrove forests, especially in created and restored mangrove forests that are intended to compensate for ecosystem functions lost during mangrove forest conversion to other land uses. To better quantify the rate of soil organic matter development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests, we measured ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence. We compared ecosystem properties in created, maturing mangrove forests to adjacent natural mangrove forests. We also quantified site-specific changes that occurred between 2010 and 2016. Soil organic matter accumulated rapidly beneath maturing mangrove forests as sandy soils transitioned to organic-rich soils (peat). Within 25 yr, a 20-cm deep peat layer developed. The time required for created mangrove forests to reach equivalency with natural mangrove forests was estimated as (1) <15 yr for herbaceous and juvenile vegetation, (2) ~55 yr for adult trees, (3) ~25 yr for the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), and (4) ~45-80 yr for the lower soil layer (10-30 cm). For soil elevation change, the created mangrove forests were equivalent to or surpassed natural mangrove forests within the first 5 yr. A comparison to chronosequence studies from other ecosystems indicates that the rate of soil organic matter accumulation beneath maturing mangrove forests may be among the fastest globally. In most peatland ecosystems, soil organic matter formation occurs slowly (over centuries, millennia); however, these results show that mangrove peat formation can occur within decades. Peat development, primarily due to subsurface root accumulation, enables mangrove forests to sequester carbon, adjust their elevation relative to sea level, and adapt to changing conditions at the dynamic land-ocean interface. In the face of climate change and rising sea levels, coastal managers are increasingly concerned with the longevity and functionality of coastal restoration efforts. Our results advance understanding of the pace of ecosystem development in created, maturing mangrove forests, which can improve predictions of mangrove forest responses to global change and ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Large quantities of sediment deposited in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary by the Changjiang River promote the propagation of coastal wetlands, the expansion of saltmarsh vegetation, and carbon sequestration. In this study, using the Chongming Dongtan Wetland in the Changjiang estuary as the study area, the spatial and temporal distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the influences of sedimentation and vegetation on the SOC stocks of the coastal wetland were examined in 2013. There was sediment accretion in the northern and middle areas of the wetland and in the Phragmites australis marsh in the southern area, and sediment erosion in the Scirpus mariqueter marsh and the bare mudflat in the southern area. More SOC accumulated in sediments of the vegetated marsh than in the bare mudflat. The total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased in the above-ground biomass from spring to autumn and decreased in winter; in the below-ground biomass, they gradually increased from spring to winter. The TOC stocks were higher in the below-ground biomass than in the above-ground biomass in the P. australis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, but were lower in the below-ground biomass in S. mariqueter marsh. Stocks of SOC showed temporal variation and increased gradually in all transects from spring to winter. The SOC stocks tended to decrease from the high marsh down to the bare mudflat along the three transects in the order: P. australis marsh > S. alterniflora marsh > S. mariqueter marsh > bare mudflat. The SOC stocks of the same vegetation type were higher in the northern and middle transects than in the southern transect. These results suggest that interactions between sedimentation and vegetation regulate the SOC stocks in the coastal wetland in the Changjiang estuary.

AB  - Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.

AB  - This paper presents the first record of fire in Pacific coast salt marshes; the 1993 Green Meadows Fire and the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire burned an area ofSalicornia-dominated salt marsh at Point Mugu, CA. These fires inspire concern about resiliency of ecosystems not adapted to fire, already threatened by sea-level rise (SLR), and under stress from extreme drought. We monitored vegetation percent cover, diversity, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in burned and unburned areas of the salt marsh following the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire and used remotely sensed Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) analysis to verify the in situ data. Two years following the fire, vegetation percent cover in burned areas was significantly lower than in unburned areas, with dominant-species change in recovered areas, and NDVI was lower than pre-fire conditions. Multi-year disturbance, such as fire, presents challenges for salt marsh resilience and dependent species, especially in sites facing multiple stressors. With anticipated higher temperatures, increased aridity, extreme drought, and higher frequency fires becoming a reality for much of the Pacific coast, this study indicates that fire inSalicornia-dominated marshes is a vulnerability that will need to be addressed differently from other grass- or reed-dominated marsh systems.

AB  - [1] Wetlands represent the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon pool and thus play an important role in global carbon cycles. Most global carbon budgets, however, have focused on dry land ecosystems that extend over large areas and have not accounted for the many small, scattered carbon-storing ecosystems such as tidal saline wetlands. We compiled data for 154 sites in mangroves and salt marshes from the western and eastern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. The set of sites spans a latitudinal range from 22.4degreesS in the Indian Ocean to 55.5degrees N in the northeastern Atlantic. The average soil carbon density of mangrove swamps (0.055 +/- 0.004 g cm(-3)) is significantly higher than the salt marsh average (0.039 +/- 0.003 g cm(-3)). Soil carbon density in mangrove swamps and Spartina patens marshes declines with increasing average annual temperature, probably due to increased decay rates at higher temperatures. In contrast, carbon sequestration rates were not significantly different between mangrove swamps and salt marshes. Variability in sediment accumulation rates within marshes is a major control of carbon sequestration rates masking any relationship with climatic parameters. Globally, these combined wetlands store at least 44.6 Tg C yr(-1) and probably more, as detailed areal inventories are not available for salt marshes in China and South America. Much attention has been given to the role of freshwater wetlands, particularly northern peatlands, as carbon sinks. In contrast to peatlands, salt marshes and mangroves release negligible amounts of greenhouse gases and store more carbon per unit area.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of 'blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

AB  - Salt marshes, due to their capability to bury soil carbon (C), are potentially important regional C sinks. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades in New England (USA), as well as in some other parts of the world. In this study, we investigated plant biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at four sites where restoration of tidal flow occurred five to ten years prior to the study. Site elevation, aboveground biomass, CO2 flux, and porewater chemistry were measured in 2015 and 2016 in both restored marshes and adjacent marshes where tidal flow had never been restricted. We found that the elevation in restored marsh sites was 2-16 cm lower than their natural references. Restored marshes where porewater chemistry was similar to the natural reference had greater plant aboveground biomass, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, as well as net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) than the natural reference, even though they had the same plant species. We also compared respiration rates in aboveground biomass (AR) and soil ( BR) during July 2016, and found that restored marshes had higher AR and BR fluxes than natural references. Our findings indicated that well-restored salt marshes can result in greater plant biomass and NEP, which has the potential to enhance rates of C sequestration at 10-yrs post restoration. Those differences were likely due to lower elevation and greater flooding frequency in the recently restored marshes than the natural marsh. The inverse relationship between elevation and productivity further suggests that, where sea-level rise rate does not surpass the threshold of plant survival, the restoration of these salt marshes may lead to enhanced organic and mineral sedimentation, extending marsh survival under increased sea level, and recouping carbon stocks that were lost during decades of tidal restriction.

AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or "blue carbon" systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

AB  - Tidal marshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that are often considered as hot-spots of atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.

AB  - Plant-mediated processes determine carbon (C) cycling and storage in many ecosystems; how plant-associated processes may be altered by climate-induced changes in environmental drivers is therefore an essential question for understanding global C cycling. In this study, we hypothesize that environmental alterations associated with near-term climate change can exert strong control on plant-associated ecosystem C cycling and that investigations along an extended hydrologic gradient may give mechanistic insight into C cycling. We utilize a mesocosm approach to investigate the response of plant, soil, and gaseous C cycling to changing hydrologic regimes and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations expected by 2100 in a coastal salt marsh in Louisiana, USA. Although elevated CO2 had no significant effects on C cycling, we demonstrate that greater average flooding depth stimulated C exchange, with higher rates of labile C decomposition, plant CO2 assimilation, and soil C respiration. Greater average flooding depth also significantly decreased the soil C pool and marginally increased the aboveground biomass C pool, leading to net losses in total C stocks. Further, flooding depths along an extended hydrologic gradient garnered insight into decomposition mechanisms that was not apparent from other data. In C-4 dominated salt marshes, sea level rise will likely overwhelm effects of elevated CO2 with climate change. Deeper flooding associated with sea level rise may decrease long-term soil C pools and quicken C exchange between soil and atmosphere, thereby threatening net C storage in salt marsh habitats. Manipulative studies will be indispensable for understanding biogeochemical cycling under future conditions.
   Plain Language Summary This study examines how near-term climate change may affect the exchange and storage of carbon by plants in salt marshes. Our results indicate that sea level rise will increase the amount of carbon that is moved from the soil into the atmosphere, shrinking the amount of carbon in salt marsh soil. This may reduce the ability of salt marshes to keep carbon in soil long term and decrease the ability of salt marshes to offset climate change. As salt marshes are some of the best ecosystems on the planet for storing carbon in soils, any change in how these ecosystems process carbon is important to understand.

AB  - Estimates of global carbon stocks in coastal wetlands reveal that these are some of the most efficient carbon-sequestering environments in the world, which has prompted a renewed interest in conservation and restoration programs as an opportunity for greenhouse gas abatement. Accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands is linked to diverse factors such as the type of vegetation, geomorphic setting, and sediment supply. Feedbacks between these factors and the tidal flow conditions drive the dynamics of carbon accumulation rates. Climate change-induced sea-level rise has been shown to increase the vulnerability to submergence of saltmarsh and mangroves in coastal wetlands, even if accommodation and landward colonization are possible. These potential losses of wetland vegetation combined with the reduced productivity of newly colonized areas will directly affect the capacity of the wetlands to sequester carbon from sediments and root growth. Here, we implement an eco-geomorphic model to simulate vegetation dynamics, soil carbon accumulation, and changes in soil carbon stock for a restored mangrove-saltmarsh wetland experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. We evaluate model outcomes for existing conditions and two different management scenarios aimed at mitigating sea-level rise effects and conserve wetland vegetation. Even though some management measures can result in partial conservation of wetland vegetation, they do not necessarily result in the best option for soil carbon capture. Our results suggest that accelerated sea-level can trigger accelerated wetland colonization resulting in wetland areas with limited opportunities for soil carbon capture from sediment and root mineralization, an issue that has not been considered in previous studies.

AB  - The impacts of coastal reclamation on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sinks of coastal wetlands remain unclearly understood. This study was conducted to investigate the alterations of soil organic C and N (SOC and SON) pools following conversion of Phragmites australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields and town construction land through reclamation along Jiangsu coast in eastern China. Coastal reclamation significantly increased stocks of soil total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N (SLOC, SLON, SROC, and SRON), and concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C and N (SMBC and SMBN), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields. However, coastal reclamation reduced SOC, SLOC, SROC, SRON, WSOC, SMBC, SMBN, and MINC following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into town construction land. Our results suggest that coastal reclamation affects C and N sinks of coastal wetlands by changing SOC and SON pools size, stability and dynamics changes following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into other land use types. This finding were primarily attributed to alterations in quantity and quality of exogenous materials returning the soil, and soil physiochemical properties as affected by coastal reclamation.

AB  - Across the globe, coastal wetland vegetation distributions are changing in response to climate change. In the southeastern United States, increased winter temperatures have resulted in poleward range expansion of mangroves into pure salt marsh habitat. Climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marsh will significantly alter carbon (C) storage capacity of these wetlands, which currently store the highest average C per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Total ecosystem C stocks were measured along a 342 km latitudinal gradient of mangrove - to - marsh dominance in Florida. Carbon stocks were quantified through measurements of above- and belowground biomass and soil C. Interior mangrove C stocks were greater than both salt marsh and ecotonal C stocks and soil C comprised the majority of each ecosystem C component (51-98%). The wetlands investigated in this study cover 38,532 ha, and store an average of 215 Mg of C ha(-1). Currently, mangroves cover 31% of the land area studied, storing 44% of the total C, whereas salt marshes occupy 68% of the wetland area and only store 55% of the C. Total conversion of salt marsh to mangrove may increase C storage by 26%, predominately due to increases in aboveground biomass.

AB  - The burial of "blue carbon" in coastal marsh soils is partially offset by marsh-atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, but this offset may be greater if other pathways of CH4 export exist. Here we report that salt marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative tracer Ra-226 at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the 2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m(3) day(-1). Dissolved CH4 fluxes of 27-1,200 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) were calculated by multiplying the volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3-5.5 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1). This is equivalent to 125 (56-245) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) assuming that CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to the 138 (1.1-260) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) average calculated across other studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a combined total of similar to 30% of the global cooling potential derived from soil carbon sequestration.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are wetland ecosystems found along the coast. Scientists and policymakers are interested in salt marshes because they accumulate carbon in their soil over long time scales. This carbon would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, exacerbating global climate change. However, microorganisms living in the soil break down some of this buried carbon and produce other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that contribute more to warming than carbon dioxide. Scientists have measured how much methane escapes from the soil to the atmosphere. Carbon burial more than offsets this methane export, meaning that salt marshes have a small net cooling effect on Earth's climate. In this study, we incorporate a previously unaccounted pathway for methane export from salt marshes into their radiative budget. Methane in marsh soil and surrounding sediments can be dissolved in groundwater that discharges from the pore spaces between soil and sediment particles. This groundwater flows slowly toward the marsh edge until it discharges into nearby surface waters, carrying dissolved methane with it. We estimate that this methane export from groundwater approximately doubles total methane emissions from salt marshes. This is still not enough methane export to counteract all of the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils. However, it is important for policymakers to include both pathways of methane export when calculating the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils or its economic value.

AB  - Purpose Soils of tidal marshes play an important role in regional carbon (C) cycles as they are able to store considerable amounts of organic carbon (OC). However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.
   Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.
   Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.
   Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.

AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes sequester significant quantities of carbon and arc suffering from anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enhancement. However, the effects of this N loading on carbon gas emissions from freshwater-oligohaline tidal marshes are unknown. In this paper, we report on our evaluation of the effects of a N gradient (0, 24, 48 and 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2) y(-1)) on the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. On an annual scale, the oligohaline marsh has significantly higher CO2 emissions, while it has slightly lower CH4 emissions relative to freshwater marsh. The addition of N increased CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh and decreased CH4 emission from the oligohaline marsh, although there was no statistically significant difference in CH4 emission between either of the two marshes and the control. The addition of 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2 )y(-1) significantly increased CO2 emission from the freshwater marsh, while it did not significantly influence CO2 emission from the oligohaline marsh. CH4 and CO2 emission levels were positively correlated with soil temperature under all conditions. The CH4 flux resulting from both the control and the addition of N was negatively correlated with porewater SO42- and Cl- concentrations and soil EC in the oligohaline marsh. Overall, N addition significantly increased carbon gas emissions under freshwater conditions while slightly inhibiting carbon gas emissions from the oligohaline marsh. Our findings suggested that even under low salinity conditions, the effects of N loading on CH4 and CO2 emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes can vary. We propose that the addition of N to estuarine tidal marshes has a significant effect on the carbon cycle and promotes soil carbon loss, phenomena which may be influenced by salinity.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to adjacent waters and, consequently, exert a strong influence on the quantity and quality of DOC exported to the coastal oceans. Our understanding of the factors that control the exchange of DOC at the tidal marsh-estuarine interface, however, remains limited. We hypothesize that tidal marsh soils act as a regulator and that their physical characteristics, such as organic carbon content and mineral phase composition, are key controls on DOC exchange between soil surfaces and both surface and interstitial waters. To test this hypothesis, we generated traditional Langmuir sorption isotherms using anaerobic batch incubations of four tidal wetland soils, representing a range of soil organic carbon content (1.77% +/- 0.12% to 36.2% +/- 2.2%) and salinity regimes (freshwater to mixoeuhaline), across four salinity treatments. Results suggest that the maximum soil sorption capacity and DOC binding affinity increase and decrease with greater salinity, respectively, though the enhancement of maximum soil sorption capacity is somewhat mitigated in soils richer in poorly crystalline iron minerals. Initial natively sorbed organic carbon showed a significant positive correlation with soil specific surface area and K showed a moderate yet significant positive correlation with poorly crystalline iron mineral content. Taken together, these results point to a strong mineralogical control on tidal marsh sorption dynamics and a complex physicochemical response of those dynamics to salinity in tidal marsh soils.

AB  - Global recognition of climate change and its predicted consequences has created the need for practical management strategies for increasing the ability of natural ecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon. Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.

AB  - Salt marsh survival with sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly relies on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and preservation. Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (<= 1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (delta C-13), and age ((FC)-C-14) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented similar to 9%-17% of shallow SOC (<= 26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.

AB  - Photosynthetic carbon is an integral part of carbon cycle in plant-soil system, also is an important source of soil organic carbon. In this study, C-13 labeling was used for exploring allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in Phragmites australis -soil system undergoing the salt marsh restoration project by freshwater pumping in Yellow River Estuary (YRE), China. Samples were collected from T-0 (before labeling) to 90 days after labeling (T-4), in natural salt marsh, 5-, 10- and 15-year freshwater pumping areas, respectively. The photosynthate-C-13 contents of soil were gradually decreased to 0 mg/g at T-4 in most areas, while it was 2.21 mg/g in 15-year pumping area, higher than other areas at the last sampling time (T-4). And the allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in soil was increased from 3.58% at T-2 to 44.46% at T-3 in natural salt marsh, while no significant change was found in other areas from T-2 to T-3, followed by the significantly higher photosynthate-C-13 proportion in soils of 15-year pumping area at T-4. EC (R-2 = 0.5972) and small macro-aggregates proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.4829) had positive correlations with A photosynthate-C-13 (the value of photosynthate-C-13 in underground part minus that in soil); silt and clay fractions proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.7044) had negative correlation with Delta photosynthate-C-13. Distribution and transportation of photosynthetic carbon in the underground were affected by soil physical and chemical properties.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora was planted in the Jiangsu Province, China, in 1982; however, its effects on ecological processes in the local intertidal ecosystem are not well understood. To estimate the effects of S. alterniflora salt marshes on the intertidal zones of Jiangsu Province, the following work was done: (1) the area of S. alterniflora salt marsh expansion from 1985 to 2004 was obtained, as was the total net primary production (TNPP) and CO2 fixation of the salt marshes, (2) bulk density and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the S. alterniflora salt marshes and in mudflats were determined, and (3) total soil organic carbon in the top 20 cm of sediment (TSOC) in S. alterniflora salt marshes and mudflats was estimated and compared.
   During the past 22 years, the area of S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province increased by 1875 times. Accordingly, the total net primary production (TNPP) of the S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province added up to 3760 million kg, and CO2 fixed by the S. alterniflora salt marshes amounted to 3130 million kg over the 22 years. A significant difference was found between bulk density in three research sites (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA), and the SOC in S. alterniflora salt marshes was significantly higher than that in mudflats (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA). TSOC in 2004 was 247 million kg in S. alterniflora salt marshes and 164 million kg in mudflats, indicating that 83 million kg of organic carbon was sequestrated into the soil pool because of planting S. alterniflora. These results imply that S. alterniflora enhanced the carbon sink capacity of the intertidal ecosystem in the Jiangsu Province, positive contribution to alleviating CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

AB  - Restoring and protecting "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or re-storing ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.

AB  - Mean soil respiration rates (carbon dioxide efflux from bare soils) among salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, RI ranged from 1.7-7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in Spartina patens in high marsh zones and 1.7-6.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in S. alterniflora in low marsh zones. The soil respiration rates significantly increased along a gradient of increasing watershed nitrogen (N) loads (S. alterniflora, R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.0008; S. patens, R-2 = 0.70, P = 0.02). As the soil respiration increased, the percent carbon (C) and N in the soil surface layer decreased in the S. alterniflora, suggesting that in part, the increased soil respiration rates are contributing to the increased turnover of labile organic matter. In contrast, there were no apparent relationships between the soil respiration rates in the high marsh and the soil C and N contents of the surface layer. However, there was a broad-scale pattern and significant inverse relationship between the high marsh soil respiration rates and the landscape belowground biomass of S. patens. As more and more salt marsh systems are subjected to increasing nutrient loads, decomposition rates of soil organic matter may increase in marsh soils leading to higher turnover rates of C and N.

AB  - Invasion of an exotic C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora has been shown to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations in native C-3 plant-dominated coastal wetlands of China. However, little is known about the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC concentrations and fractions in tidal marshes dominated by native C-4 plants. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0-4 years (SA-4), 4-8 years (SA-8), and 8-12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10-50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C-4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities.

AB  - Habitat patch composition and configuration mediate the fitness and distribution of many species. However, we know little about how this landscape complementation may influence the distribution of an invasive species' ecological impacts and, in turn, how this affects ecosystem resilience to disturbance. We surveyed > 820 km of coastline to evaluate how landscape complementation mediates patterns in invasive feral hog (Sus scrofa) rooting, trampling and wallowing disturbances in southeastern US salt marshes and assessed marsh resilience to these behaviors in an 8-site survey and 13-month field experiment. We discovered that hog rooting and trampling most often occur where hardwood forest comprises > 30% and salt marsh < 22% of habitat surrounding each surveyed site, respectively, while wallowing correlated most strongly with salt marsh invertebrate densities. At the 8 survey sites, vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, and surface elevation were consistently lower, and soil anoxia and porewater ammonium-nitrogen higher, in hog-disturbed relative to undisturbed areas. The experiment revealed that vegetation can recover when rooted or trampled, but remains depressed when wallowed or repeatedly disturbed. Together, these findings provide novel evidence that habitat patch composition at landscape scales can act together with local habitat attributes to dictate invasive species' disturbance patterns and highlight areas most vulnerable to invaders. In salt marshes, insights gleaned from such consideration of landscape complementation can inform conservation and management strategies for curbing the impact of this prolific, global invader.

AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora has been reported to modify carbon (C) cycling processes and pools of the native salt marsh ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased. Our results showed that it is very important to assess the effects of invasion on SOC dynamics in salt marsh ecosystems by considering both the expansion direction and invasion age.

AB  - In North America, the dynamic ecotonal boundary between mangrove and salt marsh is currently fluctuating in response to freeze-free winters, which can cause rapid alterations in a number of wetland processes and attributes. Permanent plots were established in pure salt marsh habitat along the Atlantic coast of Florida in 2015, and by 2018, mangrove saplings had encroached into plots. In this study, above- and belowground biomass measurements and soil C in the top 10-cm soil profile were quantified in 2018 and compared to 2015 data to better understand the effects of mangrove encroachment on C storage in salt marsh habitat. Plant and soil fractions were tested for C-13 stable isotopic signatures to elucidate soil C sources. In 3 years, mangrove biomass increased dramatically and soil C doubled in pure salt marsh plots, consequently increasing total C in the system. Soil organic matter increased, while there was no change in soil C:N. C-13 values suggest that soil C was derived mainly from salt marsh soil organic matter, especially that of belowground, rather than aboveground biomass. These results provide real-time, quantitative data on the encroachment of mangroves into salt marshes over a relatively short period of time.

AB  - The scarcity of data on tidal marsh soil accumulation rates (SAR) and soil organic carbon accumulation rates (CAR) globally precludes a comprehensive assessment of the role of tidal marshes in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Particularly few data exist from the southern hemisphere and for Australia in particular, which contains similar to 24% of globally recognised tidal marsh extent. Here we estimate SAR and CAR over the last 70 years using Pb-210-based geochronologies in temperate estuarine tidal marsh ecosystems in southern Western Australia (WA). Specifically, we assessed tidal marsh ecosystems situated in two geomorphic settings (marine vs. fluvial deltas) within 10 wave-dominated, barrier estuaries. Overall, average SAR (1.1 +/- 0.3 mm yr(-1)) and CAR (32 +/- 9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) estimates were 5-fold lower than global mean estimates. Furthermore, we showed that hotspots of soil organic carbon stocks are not indicative of current hotspots for CAR. The lack of significant differences (P > 0.05) in SAR, CAR, and excess Pb-210 inventories between marine and fluvial settings can be explained by the high heterogeneity among and within estuaries throughout the region. The relative stability of recent and Holocene relative sea-levels in WA likely explains the limited CAR potential in tidal marshes under relatively stable sea-level conditions. However, further research exploring interactions among biotic and abiotic factors within estuaries is required to shed more light on the small spatial-scale variability in SAR and CAR across tidal marsh ecosystems in WA and elsewhere. This study provides baseline estimates for the inclusion of tidal marshes in national carbon inventories, identifies hotspots for the development of blue carbon projects, and supports the use of site-specific assessments opposed to regional means for estimating blue carbon resources.

AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr(-1), which is similar to 30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.

AB  - New England high salt marsh primary productivity is limited by N, but variation in plant N availability across salt marsh vegetation zones has not been quantified. To investigate this, we measured in situ net N mineralization rates throughout the growing season in three zones of a Maine high salt marsh, Juncus gerardii, Spartina patens, and mixed perennial forb. We also measured microclimate factors ( soil temperatures and moistures) and substrate quality parameters ( soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil C: N ratio) to see if either related to differences in net N mineralization. To determine the relative importance of substrate quality and microclimate, we measured N mineralization of the different soil types in the laboratory, holding microclimate parameters constant. We also investigated the relative importance of microclimate and substrate statistically, with principal components analysis and multiple regression. In situ net N mineralization rates were significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but graminoid zone N mineralization rates did not vary significantly from each other. Soil temperatures, moistures, carbon, and nitrogen were all significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but C: N ratio did not vary significantly across zones. Principal components analysis and multiple regression revealed that microclimate was a more significant predictor of total N mineralized over the course of the growing season than was substrate quality. In contrast, when microclimate conditions were held constant, forb zone N mineralization was still significantly higher than that of graminoid zones, suggesting that substrate quality does exert some control on this process. Thus, both microclimate and substrate quality appear to influence N mineralization rates across vegetation zones of this Maine salt marsh.

AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation plays an important role in maintaining ecological function and is a key factor affecting the soil bacterial community. Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Yancheng tidal marsh to stabilize the sediments and gradually replaced the native plants. However, the changes in the soil bacterial community profile caused by S. alterniflora invasion are poorly characterized. Here, we used MiSeq sequencing to compare the composition of the bacterial community in soil at different depths under exotic S. alterniflora (SA), native Phragmites australis (PA), and native Suaeda salsa (SS). The results showed that the pH value was lower, but the salinity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and number of 16S rRNA genes were higher in SA soils than in PA and SS soils. Overall, Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae. Anaerolineae in the Chloroflexi phylum showed the greatest difference based on vegetation, accounting for 14.4% of the overall bacterial community in SA soils but only about 3.8% of those in PA and SS soils. The composition, interaction, and predicted functional profiles of the bacterial community in SA soils were significantly different from those in PA and SS soils, especially for functions related to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Salinity was negatively correlated with the Shannon index and accounted for 37.7% of the total variation in the bacterial community, making it the most important environmental factor. Our results showed the differences in bacterial community composition among different vegetation types and soil depths in the Yancheng tidal marsh, which provides a microbial basis for a better understanding of the ecological functions in this ecosystem.

AB  - As an important component of global change, plant invasion threaten the sustainability of global ecosystems and may alter the carbon dynamics in the invaded area. Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important "blue carbon" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion. This work indicates causal relationships between plant invasions and soil carbon pools and highlights the nonnegligible importance of inorganic C in coastal blue carbon budgets.

AB  - Seawalls have increasingly been constructed to control the invasion of an exotic perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, in coastal wetlands of eastern China. We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico blue carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes) form an important North American blue carbon hot spot. These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km(2) to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha. Constraints on the partial estuarine fluxes given for this new data are discussed as well as widespread anthropogenic destruction of the GoM blue carbon. A new North American comparison of our GoM blue carbon stocks versus Atlantic coastal blue carbon stock estimates is presented. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The construction of sea embankments is an increasingly common approach for controlling the spread of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in coastal wetlands of eastern China. However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh. Sea embankment reclamation could greatly weaken the C and N sinks of S. alterniflora salt marsh and potentially affect C and N sinks in the coastal wetlands of eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes store large amounts of carbon due to high rates of plant productivity and low organic matter decomposition rates in anoxic soils. As woody mangroves continue to encroach into herbaceous salt marshes, it is important to understand how these wetland biomes differ in soil microbial communities. Mangroves and marsh plants have different rooting structures and chemical qualities and could generate different environments for soil microbes, thus leading to changes in soil carbon processing. In an ecotonal ecosystem in Florida, where mangroves are rapidly encroaching into salt marshes, we compared wetland soil microbial community composition and function in mangrove-dominated vs. salt marsh-dominated plots. Microbial community structure differed between mangrove-dominant and marsh-dominant plots. The top indicator genera in the marsh-dominated plots belonged to putatively anaerobic groups (Tepidibacter, Caldithrix, Desulfovibro, Fibrobacteres, Thiotrichaceae) while top indicator genera in mangrove-dominated plots had representatives within Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Proteobacteria. In a substrate-induced respiration assay, samples from mangrove plots with the greatest root mass also had the highest rate of labile C substrate consumption. Our results suggest that mangroves and marsh plants have different sediment microbial communities and that future mangrove encroachment into salt marshes could alter soil microbial communities with potential implications for soil carbon storage.

AB  - Freshwater input for salt marsh restoration in the Yellow River Delta induced Phragmites australis expansion and thus may cause shifts of soil fungi from halophilic to desalination-adapted species for increased litter decomposition. In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The carbon cycle is significantly affected by Spartina alterniflora invasion through its impact on blue carbon in many salt marshes. To determine the impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC), we studied the vertical and horizontal distribution of SOC. And stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the impact of the age of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC in Chongming Dongtan wetland located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The results showed that the SOC concentration was higher in the S. alterniflora community than that in the native Phragmites australis community. The age of invasion and the SOC concentration increased with increasing elevation, while the SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth. The delta C-13 value became less negative at greater depth, which was related to the contribution from C-13-enriched carbon sources after 3 years of invasion. After 7 and 10 years, the delta(13)value became more negative at greater depth in both communities. S. alterniflora had a positive effect on the soil carbon pool, and its contribution was related to soil depth. In the low tidal marshes, the contribution of S. alterniflora was negatively correlated with soil depth, while it was positively correlated with soil depth in the high tidal marshes. The results from this study will contribute to improved understanding of future ecological consequences.

AB  - 1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation.
   2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing.
   3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation.
   4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential.
   5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.

AB  - Despite the growing recognition regarding the carbon cycle in the rhizosphere of upland ecosystems, little is known regarding the rhizosphere effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization in tidal marsh soils. In the current study, in situ rhizobox experiments (including rhizosphere and inner and outer bulk soil) were conducted in an estuarine tidal marsh. Our results showed that a higher abundance of total bacteria, Geobacter, dsrA and mcrA and lower a-diversity were observed in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil. Rhizosphere effects shifted the partition of terminal metabolic pathways from sulfate reduction in the bulk soil to the co-dominance of microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction in the rhizosphere. Although the rhizosphere effect promoted the rates of three terminal metabolic pathways, it showed greater preference towards microbial Fe(III) reduction in the tidal marsh soils. Plant species had little impact on the partitioning of terminal metabolic pathways, but did affect the potential of total SOC mineralization together with the abundance and diversity of total bacteria. Both the rhizosphere effect and plant species influenced the bacterial community composition in the tidal marsh soils; however, plant species had a less pronounced impact on the bacterial community compared with that of the rhizosphere effect.

AB  - The soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity of salt marshes is of considerable importance with respect to the mitigatiing the potentially detrimental consequences of global climate change. Given that tidal salt marshes are subjected to periodic cycles of inundation, it is assumed that soil C cycle in these marshes is expected to be controlled to varing extent by changes in soil moisture and salinity induced by the alternating patterns of drying and rewetting. In addition, with increases in the extent and severity of nitrogen (N) eutrophication becomes serious, we predicted that soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in tidal salt marshes is likely to be highly responsive to increased N loading. In this study, we conducted a two-factor mesocosm experiment (simulated inundation and N input in a tidal salt marsh) to determine the interactive effects of N eutrophication and inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. Our results showed that increased inundation frequency led to lower levels of CO2 emission but greater CH4 emission, whereas N input weakened the effects of changes in inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions. Moreover, N input was found to modify CO2 and CH4 emission in response to variations in soil moisture. We also observed an enhancement of soil DOC loss in response to increasing inundation frequency, and that DOC loss in the surface soil was considerably greater than that in subsurface soil. Further, as inundation frequency increased, we detected changes in the relationship between soil DOC and CO2 and CH4. Our findings highlighted that vertical variation in soil moisture induced by inundation is a key factor controlling SOC loss in tidal salt marshes, although N input can weaken this control.

AB  - In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

AB  - Salinity changes resulting from storm surge, tides, precipitation, and stormwater run-off are common in coastal wetlands. Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.

AB  - Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia. Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands are known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level, and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four corestwo collected from marine-influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo marine site (WAP-M) and Port Stephens marine site (POR-M)) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo fluvial site (WAP-F) and Port Stephens fluvial site (POR-F))highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C; however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

AB  - We measured sediment organic carbon and nitrogen accumulation and rates of denitrification enzyme activity and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) production from slurries of sediments of a mudflat that formed in 2002, a young (8-year-old) natural Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that developed on part of the mudfiat, and four mature (>200 years old) salt marshes in southeastern Georgia to examine microbial processes related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling during succession from mudflat to mature marsh. Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17 g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8 years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

AB  - Transformation of agricultural land to natural terrestrial vegetation has been suggested as a means to increase soil carbon storage. However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been "reclaimed," that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.

AB  - Tidal wetlands play an important role with respect to climate change because of both their sensitivity to sea-level rise and their ability to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Policy-based interest in carbon sequestration has increased recently, and wetland restoration projects have potential for carbon credits through soil carbon sequestration. We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using Cs-137 and Pb-210 downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0.2-0.5 cm year(-1), indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on Pb-210 dating was 79 g C m(-2) year(-1), with slightly higher rates based on Cs-137 dating. There was little difference in the sequestration rates among sites or across stations within sites, indicating that a single carbon sequestration rate could be used for crediting tidal wetland restoration projects within the Estuary.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide important ecological services, habitat, disturbance regulation, water quality improvement, and biodiversity, as well as accumulation and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in vegetation and soil organic matter. Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0-60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9 kg C/m(2) compared to 16.2 kg C/m(2) in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152 g/m(2)/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the ability to sequester and store carbon. Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance's National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this 'blue carbon' storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.

AB  - To investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents and stocks in tidal salt marsh soils, 15 cores to a depth of 40 cm were collected in five sampling sites along a sampling belt during three seasons. Our results showed that higher SOC and TN contents occurred in the surface soils in three sampling seasons. Spatial distributions of SOC and TN showed moderate variability. The C/N ratios were higher in the summer and autumn than in spring. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and soil total nitrogen density (TND) ranked in the following order: autumn > spring > summer. And the SOCD values positively correlated with the distances from the tidal creek in summer, while this correlation was negative in autumn and spring. The soil properties, such as the soil moisture, salinity, C/N ratio and C/P ratio, significantly correlated with the SOC and TN contents and stocks. The water and salinity regulation and the alternation of ratios of ecological stoichiometry should be considered to strengthen carbon and nitrogen sequestration in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Tidal saline wetlands (TSW), such as mangrove and salt marsh systems, provide many valuable ecosystem services, but continue to suffer disturbance, degradation and deforestation. Tropical mangroves perform a critical role in the exchange and storage of terrestrial-marine carbon but can function as a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known of biogeochemical processes in temperate mangrove and salt marsh systems in the southern hemisphere. In this study, the soil/sediment exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O was measured seasonally along a natural transition from melaleuca woodland, salt marsh and into mangroves along the Mornington Peninsula edge of Westernport Bay, Victoria, Australia. Soil/sediment physiochemical properties and sediment C density were measured concurrently.
   The melaleuca woodland soil was a constant CH4 sink of approximately -25 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) but along the transect this rapidly switched to a weak CH4 source (<5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) in the salt marsh which increased further in the mangrove sediments where emissions of up to 375 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) were measured in summer. Sediment CH4 exchange correlated with salinity, pneumatophore number and the redox potential of sediment water at depth. All three ecosystems were a small N2O source of <10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Soil-atmosphere exchange was dominated by CO2 which showed a significant response according to ecosystem and season along with soil temperature and salinity. Sediment C density was significantly greater in the salt marsh than the mangrove. Salt marsh sediment C density was 168 Mg C ha(-1) which is comparable with that measured globally, whereas the mangrove sediment C density of 145 Mg C ha(-1) is among the lowest reported. Contrary to global patterns in terrestrial soil C content and salt marsh sediment C content, data from our study indicate that mangrove sediments from a cooler, drier temperate latitude may store less C than mangroves in warmer and wetter tropical latitudes. Understanding both C storage and the greenhouse gas balance of TSWs will help us to better value these vulnerable ecosystems and manage them accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers that affect other organisms by creating, modifying, maintaining or destroying habitats have received widespread attention. Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography. Taken together, the results of this study provide scientific and effective implication and guidance for the restoration of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes, as "blue carbon" ecosystems, play a critical role in mitigation of global climate change since their large soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Drying-rewetting cycles induced by periodic tides have profound influence on soil carbon cycling in tidal salt marshes. However, the magnitude and mechaanism of the effects of drying-rewetting frequency on SOC loss in tidal salt marshes is still uncertain. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to identify how drying-rewetting frequency changes alter the vertical (CO2 and CH4) and lateral (dissolved organic carbon) carbon losses of soils in a tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We found that increasing soil moisture inhibited CO2 emission but stimulated CH4 emission in a tidal salt marsh. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was produced in the drying phase and rewetting lead to the loss of DOC. Soil moisture and salinity change induced by drying-rewetting cycles were the critical factors controlling vertical organic carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh. DOC had significant effects on CO2 emissions. Changes of tidal action and drying-rewetting cycle induced by global change can affect the pathway of carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh.

AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and "reclaimed" for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada's Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m(-2) yr(-1), more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

AB  - Salt marshes are ubiquitous features of the tidal landscape governed by mutual feedbacks among processes of physical and biological nature. Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

AB  - In the tidal salt marshes, the spatial variation of soil carbon (C) quality along the vegetation zones is still unclear. Here, a study is conducted in the mudflat, open shrubland, and dense shrubland in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, and soil organic C (OC) stock, particulate organic matter C (POMC), and aggregate-associated OC in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths are investigated along these vegetation zones. Among the three vegetation zones, dense shrubland had the greatest soil OC stock, open shrubland had the lowest value, and mudflat had an intermediate value. In each soil depth, dense shrubland generally had higher soil OC and POMC concentrations, and POMC/OC ratio compared to mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. Moreover, dense shrubland had a greater proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) and OC content in the macro-aggregates than mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. In addition, the OC content in the soil macro-aggregates positively correlated with soil POMC concentration. These results suggest that the high spatial variability in soil OC quantity and quality along the vegetation zones should be incorporated to accurately develop regional C budget in coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, and also imply that a shift in vegetation zones induced by sea level rise could potentially cause substantial changes in the quantity and quality of soil OC in the tidal salt marshes.

AB  - The persistence of coastal marsh is dependent on its ability to maintain elevation relative to sea level, particularly for marshes experiencing high rates of shoreline erosion due to wave-attack, storms, and sea level rise. Sediments eroded at the marsh edge are either delivered onto the marsh platform or into the estuary, the latter resulting in a net loss of marsh sediments and soil carbon. Knowledge on the timing, pattern, and quantity of sediment deposition versus shoreline erosion along the marsh-estuary interface is critical for evaluating the overall health and vulnerability of coastal marshes to future scenarios of sea level rise and for estimating sediment budgets. Here we examined marsh shoreline erosion and sediment deposition for marsh sites experiencing a range of shoreline erosion rates and different levels of wind-wave exposure within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and Wildlife Refuge in Mississippi. We developed a method for calculating an erosion-deposition sediment budget using marsh elevation profiles, shoreline erosion rate, and sediment deposition measurements. Sediment budgets were calculated at four sites with varying shoreline erosion rates. Much of the sediment eroded at the marsh edge can be accounted for as marsh platform deposition, except at the most erosive site, suggesting a possible erosion threshold where eroded sediment mass is greater than platform deposition. Consistent with other studies of marsh creeks, sediment delivery to the marsh platform appears to be largely driven by wave climate. These data suggest that for erosive bay-estuarine shorelines, sediment delivered into the marsh is largely concentrated near the marsh shoreline, although shoreline erosion does not always result in a net loss of sediments from the marsh system in either decadal or annual assessments.

AB  - Invasion by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora, which has high net primary productivity and superior reproductive capacity compared with native plants, has led to rapid organic carbon accumulation and increased methane (CH4) emission in the coastal salt marsh of China. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.

AB  - Salt marshes created on dredge spoil were compared to natural marshes to evaluate the capacity of created marshes to perform carbon cycle functions. Several carbon cycle attributes were measured in eight created Spartina alterniflora Loisel salt marshes that ranged from one to 28 years, each paired with a nearby mature natural reference marsh. The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years. There was some evidence that ecosystem gas exchange in created marshes developed slightly faster than aboveground biomass production. Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes. However, carbon mineralization rates per gram soil were relatively low in the created marshes due to lower soil organic matter content. With proper construction, we suggest most major carbon fluxes can be established in created salt marshes in less than five years.

AB  - The invasive species Spartina alterniflora show a significant coexistence zonation pattern with local Phragmites australis in different mixture ratio, increasing the difficulty to monitor their distribution directly by remote sensing. Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is an important indicator to monitor the growth and physiological status. The objective of this study was to estimate CCC under different mixture ratio. Five spectral indices were selected and combined via back propagation (BP) neural network model for estimating CCC. Combining multi-indices yielded better results (R-2 = 0.7729, RAISE = 53.01 ug.cm(-2)) on average than the best single spectral index (R-2 = 0.7190, RAISE = 63.53 ug.cm(-2)) without distinguishing interspecies competition, with a total increase of 7.5% in the R-2 and a decrease of 16.56% in the RAISE. Meanwhile, when considering interspecies competition, the estimating results obtained by the BP neural network model achieved a further improvement of the R-2 value, ranging from 3.57% to 20.37%, while the prediction error reduced at varying degrees (maximum reduction of 23.78%). The results indicate that combining multi-indices by BP neural network model can alleviate the influence of interspecies competition and achieve higher estimating accuracy.

AB  - Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.

AB  - This study was carried out in three kinds of salt marshes according to the vegetation covers, including Phragmites australis salt marsh (PSM), Suaeda salus salt marsh (SSM) and Tamarix chinensis-Suaeda salus salt marsh (TSSM). We applied allometric function, exponential function and logistic function to model the depth distribution of the SOCv and SOCc for each salt marsh, respectively. The results showed that the exponential function fits the depth distribution of the SOCv more well than other two functions. The SOCc can be fitted very well by all three functions for three salt marsh (Adj. R-2 > 0.99), of which the allometric function was the best one. The mean topsoil concentration factors (TCFs) of three salt marshes were beyond 0.1, which means the SOC enrichment in surface soils due to plant cycling, but TCFs in PSM were significantly higher than those in SSM (P < 0.05). Nearly 30% of SOC was concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.

AB  - Carbon stored in coastal wetland ecosystems is of global relevance to climate regulation. Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44% of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32% of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37% of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44% of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (similar to 4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

AB  - Tidal freshwater marshes can protect downstream ecosystems from eutrophication by intercepting excess nutrient loads, but recent studies in salt marshes suggest nutrient loading compromises their structural and functional integrity. Here, we present data on changes in plant biomass, microbial biomass and activity, and soil chemistry from plots in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (GA) fertilized for 10 yr with nitrogen (+N), phosphorus (+P), or nitrogen and phosphorus (+NP). Nitrogen alone doubled aboveground biomass and enhanced microbial activity, specifically rates of potential nitrification, denitrification, and methane production measured in laboratory incubations. Phosphorus alone increased soil P and doubled microbial biomass but did not affect microbial processes. Nitrogen or P alone decreased belowground biomass and soil carbon (C) whereas +NP increased aboveground biomass, microbial biomass and N cycling, and N, P, and C assimilation and burial more than either nutrient alone. Our findings suggest differential nutrient limitation of tidal freshwater macrophytes by N and microbes by P, similar to what has been observed in salt marshes. Macrophytes outcompete microbes for P in response to long-term N and P additions, leading to increased soil C storage through increased inputs of belowground biomass relative to N and P added singly. The susceptibility of tidal freshwater marshes to long-term nutrient enrichment and, hence their ability to mitigate eutrophication will depend on the quantity and relative proportion of N vs. P entering estuaries and tidal wetlands.

AB  - A Functional and Structural Trajectory (FAST) model is presented that predicts the evolution of wetland structure and function during salt marsh ecosystem development. The FAST model is tested by comparing structural and functional attributes of marsh producers (Spartina), consumers (benthic invertebrates) and nutrient cycles (C, N, P) along a chronosequence of 1 to 28 year-old constructed Spartina alterniflora a marshes with paired older reference (natural) marshes. Salt marsh structure and function followed two inherently different trajectories during ecosystem development. Functional attributes, like Spartina biomass, invertebrate density and carbon and nutrient accumulation, exceeded 100% equivalence before decreasing to levels found in reference marshes. In contrast, structural attributes like Spartina stem density and height, invertebrate species richness and soil carbon and nutrient pools gradually converged to equivalence without ever exceeding levels in reference marshes. Our trajectories also revealed that different components of the restored salt marsh ecosystem developed at different rates. Both Spartina structure and function achieved equivalence to reference wetlands within 10-15 years following establishment. Development of invertebrate structure and function required 15-20 years. Soil C and nutrient accumulation occurred almost instantaneously with colonization by Spartina. However, after 28 years, soil C and N pools were considerably less than in reference marshes. Our FAST model demonstrates that trajectories can be developed and used to predict the evolution of salt marsh structure and function during wetland ecosystem development. The model should be tested using similar ecosystems in different geographic regions and in other detritus based ecosystems to evaluate its predictive power and robustness.

AB  - Wetlands provide many important services throughout the world, with an estimated economic value that, in comparison to other ecosystems, far exceeds their relatively small global extent. In recognition of their importance, both national and international regulations exist to protect the world's remaining wetlands. Of growing interest is the "no-net-loss'' policy which permits unavoidable destruction of wetlands if compensated by restoration of degraded wetlands or creation of new wetlands. The fundamental assumption of no-net-loss is that wetlands can be created which function equivalently to natural wetlands. One integral function that wetlands perform is cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Here we demonstrate that loss of this nutrient-related function is not being mitigated by creation or restoration of wetlands. We compare indicators of plant-and microbial-mediated functions, as well as abiotic (e. g., soil character, hydrology) and biotic (e. g., plant community composition) structure, between 10 created or restored and 5 natural freshwater depressional wetlands in central Ohio, USA. Nutrient stocks were generally smaller and transformations slower in created wetlands than in natural wetlands, with little development over time. Of particular concern were differences in C-and N-related function. Created wetlands stored 90% less C within litter and 80% less C within soil and processed 60% less N through denitrification, on average compared to natural wetlands. Our study suggests that subversion of natural wetlands into restored or created wetlands could have large-scale environmental consequences such as reduced capacity for nitrate removal and C sequestration.

AB  - Differentiation of boreal wetlands in the palaeo record is required for studies of isostacy and sea level change, landscape change, and climate dynamics. To develop palynomorph signatures and calibrate soil C-N ratios for boreal wetlands we sampled low and high elevation tidal marshes, fens and bogs along eastern James Bay, Canada. A discriminant analysis model showed that a small subset of palynomorph taxa can effectively discriminate between the four wetland types. Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Potamogeton-Triglochin-type are important to the classification of high marshes. Bryidae spores and pollen of Myrica gale, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae are indicative of fen. Moss spores alone, primarily from Sphagnum, but also Bryidae type spores, derived from brown mosses are the indicators of bog. The use of palynomorph assemblages to discriminate among wetland types is not dependent upon the localized presence of a plant source as it would be using macrofossil analysis. C/N of bog soils can be clearly distinguished from fen and tidal marshes and can be used as a pollen-independent proxy to indicate fen to bog wetland succession. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO(2)with the atmosphere (NEE = -185 g C m(2)year(-1), negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87-110 g C m(2)year(-1)), suggesting only 47-59% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017-2018 showed NEE of -255 g C m(-2) year(-1), and hydrologic export of 105 g C m(-2) year(-1)(59% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.

AB  - Many studies have found that plant invasion can enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, by increasing net primary production (NPP) and/or decreased soil respiration. While most studies have focused on C input, little attention has been paid to plant invasion effects on soil respiration, especially in wetland ecosystems. Our study examined the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil respiration and C dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. The estuary was originally occupied by two native plant species: Phragmites australis in the high tide zone and Scirpus mariqueter in the low tide zone. Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH. Our results indicated that enhanced ANPP by S. alterniflora exceeded invasion-induced C loss through soil respiration. This suggests that S. alterniflora invasion into the Yangtze River estuary could strengthen the net C sink of wetlands in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Salt marshes respond to sea-level rise through a series of complex and dynamic bio-physical feedbacks. In this study, we found that sea-level rise triggered salt marsh habitat restructuring, with the associated vegetation changes enhancing salt marsh elevation resilience. A continuous record of marsh elevation relative to sea level that includes reconstruction of high-resolution, sub-decadal, marsh elevation over the past century, coupled with a lower-resolution 1500-year record, revealed that relative sea-level rose 1.5 +/- 0.4 m, following local glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm/yr). As sea-level rise has rapidly accelerated, the high marsh zone dropped 11 cm within the tidal frame since 1932, leading to greater inundation and a shift to flood- and salt-tolerant low marsh species. Once the marsh platform fell to the elevation favored by low-marsh Spartina alterniflara, the elevation stabilized relative to sea level. Currently low marsh accretion keeps pace with sea-level rise, while present day high marsh zones that have not transitioned to low marsh have a vertical accretion deficit. Greater biomass productivity, and an expanding subsurface accommodation space favorable for salt marsh organic matter preservation, provide a positive feed-back between sea-level rise and marsh platform elevation. Carbon storage was 46 +/- 28 g C/m(2)/yr from 550 to 1800 CE, increasing to 129 +/- 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the last decade. Enhanced carbon storage is controlled by vertical accretion rates, rather than soil carbon density, and is a direct response to anthropogenic eustatic sea-level rise, ultimately providing a negative feedback on climate warming.

AB  - Recently, greater interest in the resilience of coastal habitat ecosystem services in the northern Gulf of Mexico has emerged due in part to an expansion of mangroves into areas previously dominated by salt marshes. To operationalize coastal wetland ecosystem services for decision-making, there is a need to clarify how salt marshes and mangroves function in this region. The goal of this research is to operationalize blue carbon (carbon stored in coastal habitats) within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, TX by documenting what we know about blue carbon within the study area, identifying data gaps and future research needs, and using available knowledge to inform management and decision-making within the Reserve. Our research shows that there is a lack of data within the Reserve on mangrove aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and soil carbon and on salt marsh soil carbon. There is also a dearth of information on wetland carbon sequestration and emission rates within the Reserve, making it challenging to inform management and develop a market for blue carbon.

AB  - Plant invasion alters the fundamental structure and function of native ecosystems by affecting the biogeochemical pools and fluxes of materials and energy. Native (Suaeda salsa) and invasive (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes were selected to study the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and stocks in the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that the SOC contents (g/kg) and stocks (kg/m(2)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years, especially for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The SOC contents exhibited an even distribution along the soil profiles in native salt marshes, while the SOC contents were gradually decreased with depth after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years. The natural ln response ratios (LnRR) were applied to identify the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on the SOC stocks. We also found that Spartina alterniflora invasion might cause soil organic carbon losses in a short-term phase (2-4 years in this study) due to the negative LnRR values, especially for 20-60 cm depth. And the SOCD in surface layer (0-20 cm) do not increase linearly with the invasive age. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that silt + clay content was exponentially related with SOC in surface layer (Adjusted R-2 = 0.43, P < 0.001), suggesting that soil texture could play a key role in SOC sequestration of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing numerous services such as soil carbon storage, flood protection and nutrient filtering, several of which are mediated by the sediment microbiome associated with marsh vegetation. Here, nutrient filtering (nitrate removal through denitrification) was examined by determining microbial (bacteria and archaea) community structure (16S rRNA gene iTag sequencing), diversity, denitrification rates and metabolic potential (assembled metagenomic sequences) in collocated patches of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) and Juncus roemerianus (Juncus) sediments. The iTag data showed that diversity and richness in Spartina and Juncus sediment microbial communities were highly similar. However, microbial community evenness differed significantly, with the most even communities observed in Juncus sediments. Further, denitrification rates were significantly higher in Juncus compared to Spartina, suggesting oscillations in microbial abundances and in particular the core microbiome identified herein, along with plant diversity influence marsh nitrogen (N) removal. Amplicon and assembled metagenome sequences pointed to a potentially important, yet unappreciated Planctomycetes role in N removal in the salt marsh. Thus, ecosystem perturbations that alter marsh vegetation distribution could impact microbial diversity and may ultimately influence the ecologically important ecosystem functions the marsh sediment microbiome provides.

AB  - This study compared soil organic carbon (SOC) in wetlands dominated by native and one invasive plant specie to better understand how short-termSpartina alternifloracolonization affected carbon circulation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Freshwater marsh dominated byPhragmites australis(FM) had the highest SOC, total nitrogen (TN), and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) contents, whereas SOC contents varied only slightly among salt marshes covered bySuaeda salsa(SM2),S. alterniflora(SM3) and bare flat (MD). Invasion byS. alterniflorasubstantially changed the molecular characteristics of SOC. The spectral characteristics of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of humic acids (HAs) were similar from 4000 to 1800 cm(-1)but differed greatly from 1800 to 1000 cm(-1)among four wetlands. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technology (Py-GC/MS) was used to characterize molecular fingerprints of HAs. Aliphatics (27.38%), lignin (16.64%), nitrogen-containing compounds (Nc) (16.16%), polysaccharides (16.93%), and phenol (13.42%) were dominant inFM, and aliphatics, alkyl, and Nc were primary in HAs fromMD,SM2, andSM3.Lignin moieties were only found in HAs fromFMandSM3, which accounted for about 16.64% and 1.6% of the total ion current, respectively. The absorption bands of the FTIR spectrum around 3340 and 1650 cm(-1)inFMsamples were much larger than those in the other three wetlands. However, the ratio of the peak areas at 1620 and 2930 cm(-1)(R-1620/2930) inSM3, was lower than that inMDandSM2, and it meant carbon inSM3was less stable. Proportions of lignin and phenol moieties to total ion counts (TIC) inMDandSM2were 3.3% and 3.4%, while these proportions in FM and SM were 30% and 7.5%, respectively. It showedS. alterniflorainvasion into salt marsh would increase SOC contents and its stability, while it will inverse if freshwater marsh was supplanted byS. alterniflorain the YRD.

AB  - 1. Climatic warming can change how coastal wetland plants grow, thus altering their capacity to build land and keep pace with rising seas. As freeze events decline with climate change, mangroves expand their range to higher latitudes and displace salt marsh vegetation. Warmer air temperatures will likely alter above- and below-ground plant dynamics as this dramatic coastal wetland biome shift proceeds, which in turn may result in changes in ecosystem function such as sediment building.
   2. We used a large scale in situ warming experiment in a subtropical wetland to increase both marsh and mangrove ecosystem air temperatures. We assessed how 2 years of continuous warming influenced above- and below-ground plant growth and surface elevation relative to sea level.
   3. We found that chronic warming doubled plant height and accelerated the expansion of mangrove into salt marsh vegetation, as indicated by a sixfold greater increase in mangrove cover in warmed plots compared to ambient temperature plots and a corresponding loss in salt marsh cover. Surface elevation gain, a measure of soil-building capacity, increased due to warming over a 2-year period and these changes in surface elevation were driven by increased mangrove root production in warmed plots.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that, in some coastal wetlands, warming can facilitate plant community changes from marsh to mangrove, with corresponding increases in growth that help coastal wetlands to keep pace with sea-level rise.

AB  - Characteristics and tidal flat trends of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover were studied for the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, based on analyses of stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), grain sizes and contents of particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen (TN) and inorganic carbon (TIC) for three cores excavated from high tidal flat, middle tidal flat and bare flat. Results demonstrate that correlations between soil POC contents and delta C-13 values of the salt marsh cores were similar to those between soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and delta C-13 values of the upper soil layers of mountainous soil profiles with different altitudes. SOM of salt marsh was generally younger than 100 years, and originated mainly from topsoil erosions in catchments of the Yangtze River. Correlations of TN content with C/N ratio, POC content with TIC content and POC content with delta C-13 values for the cores suggest that turnover degrees of SOM from the salt marsh are overall low, and trends of SOM turnover are clear from the bare flat to the high tidal flat. Bare flat samples show characteristics of original sediments, with minor SOM turnover. Turnover processes of SOM have occurred and are discernable in the high and middle tidal flats, and the mixing degrees of SOM compartments with different turnover rates increase with evolution of the muddy tidal flat. The exclusive strata structure of alternate muddy laminae and silty laminae originated from dynamic depositional processes on muddy tidal flat was a great obstacle to vertical migration of dissolved materials, and SOM turnover was then constrained. The muddy tidal flat processes exerted direct influences on sequestration and turnover of SOM in the salt marsh, and had great constraints on the spatial and temporal characteristics of SOM turnover of the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion results in increased estuarine salinity, affecting both ecosystem nutrient dynamics and bacterial community composition in estuarine tidal marshes. However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity. Also, rhizospheres exerted a major control on increasing MBC and MBP but rarely affected bacterial community composition or diversity.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide many critical ecosystem services including carbon storage. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most important component of carbon stock in coastal salt marshes. However, there are large uncertainties when estimating SOC stock in coastal salt marshes at large spatial scales. So far, information on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and determinants remains limited. Moreover, the role of complex ecological interactions in shaping SOC distribution is poorly understood. Here, we report detailed field surveys on plant, soil and crab burrowing activities in two inter-tidal salt marsh sites with similar habitat conditions in Eastern China. Our between-site comparison revealed slight differences in SOC storage and a similar vertical SOC distribution pattern across soil depths of 0-60 cm. Between the two study sites, we found substantially different effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC distribution. Complex interactions involving indirect effects between soil, plants and macrobenthos (crabs) may influence SOC distribution at a landscape scale. Marked differences in the SOC determinants between the study sites indicate that the underlying driving mechanisms of SOC distribution are strongly system-specific. Future work taking into account complex interactions and spatial heterogeneity is needed for better estimating of blue carbon stock and dynamics.

AB  - Coastal wetland losses in China are globally-relevant issues, as formerly sequestered soil organic carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere. Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha(-1)) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves, 175.14 for seagrass, and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30-60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0-20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha(-1)), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), were 2.26 +/- 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 +/- 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 +/- 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12-123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr(-1). We estimate the average annual emissions of CO2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO2 yr(-1), due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion.

AB  - Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that play an important role in carbon fixing. The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream. Due to sea level rise, the area of estuarine vegetation may decrease because a fixed dike line along the river prevents landward migration, which can reduce the amount of biomass produced and with it the potential to store SOC. Restoration of the tidal marshes or realignment of the dikes may be necessary to protect the ecosystem properties and services of estuarine vegetation.

AB  - Grassland carbon capturing and storage (CCS) is thought to benefit from regulation of grazing. The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh "blue carbon" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

AB  - We examined the sediment profiles, surface accretion rates, and soil carbon (C) accumulation rates of two brackish tidal marshes on Kilbella and Wannock Rivers of the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, a region where such tidal marsh studies are rare. Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.

AB  - Coastal salt marsh has been globally fragmented by man-made coastal seawalls. However, the dynamic changes in community structure and abiotic environments in these regenerated marsh after seawall reclamation are largely unknown. We analyzed the seasonal changes of soil nutrient pools and the direction effects on them. The results showed that soil total nitrogen (TN) has decreased but soil organic carbon (SOC) has increased from May to September. Direction has influenced the patterns and seasonal changes in soil TN and SOC. The potential influencing factors have been largely contributed to soil salinity reduction, vegetation growth, microorganism activities with different seasonal characteristics. Researches on seasonal dynamic of marsh regeneration after seawall reclamation can provide us helpful information to understand mechanism of marsh restoration and design coastal marsh restoration projects.

AB  - Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical's secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration with enhanced stable carbon storage has been widely accepted as a very important ecosystem property. Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation. However, the mechanism underpinning these changes should be explored in future studies in rice soils where dynamic redox conditions exist.

AB  - Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

AB  - Expansion of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in the East China Sea coast is changing the ecosystem and thus, uncertainty has hampered methane (CH4) flux accounts in these areas. To analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of the CH4 fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, four plots were established in a salt marsh of the Nanhui coast in the southern fringe of the Yangtze River estuary, differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history and including one bare mudflat. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that CH4 fluxes from the plots ranged from 1.7 to 72.2 mg m(-2) h(-1). The mature Spartina sites showed higher CH4 emission, peaking in the summer. In the mudflat CH4 consumption was observed in January and the summer. The seasonal CH4 fluxes showed positive correlation (p < 0.05) with temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation), and negative correlation (p < 0.05) with water salinity. Various diurnal cycles in the CH4 fluxes were observed at different seasons. Average CH4 emissions were higher during the daytime than at night, however, without significant difference. Thus, the CH4 fluxes started to rise at noon, and the maximum CH4 flux was observed after the ebb tide (at 18:00) during nighttime. The diurnal variation in CH4 fluxes showed a significant correlation with season but not with temperature.

AB  - The introduction of embankment seawalls to limit the expansion of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alteniflora Loisel in eastern China's coastal wetlands has more than doubled in the past decades. Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes, whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China's Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased soil total organic C by 54.0% and total organic N by 73.2%, decreasing plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants' marsh. It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2% and 13.5%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 34.5% and 37.1%, respectively, in the Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment wall also significantly increased N2O emission by 48.9% in the Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2% in the Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections, whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2O were substantially different owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes' C and N sinks, potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China's wetlands. Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant expansion in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Soil nitrogen pools were lower in a 4-yr-old constructed salt marsh than in an adjacent natural marsh of San Diego Bay.  Aboveground biomass and foliar nitrogen content of Spartina foliosa were both lower for the constructed marsh.  Soil organic carbon, which was highly positively correlated with total nitrogen, was also lower in theconstructed marsh. Rates of nitrogen fixation were higher for the natural marsh in surface soils (1 cm depth) but not in the rhizosphere (10 cm depth).  Experimental additions of organic matter increased rates of nitrogen fixation substantially for both the constructed and natural marsh soils, with glucose stimulating greater increases than Spartina foliosa detritus (roots and rhizomes).  In comparison with natural marshes studied elsewhere, the San Diego Bay sites have low nitrogen pools and little soil organic carbon.  Nitrogen mineralization rates (in situ incubations) were high in both marshes studied.  The low nitrogen pools reflect low tidal import and infrequent streamflow influxes and, possibly, high nitrogen demands of vegetation stressed by hypersaline soils.

AB  - Increasing attention in global blue carbon investigation in these contemporary times, salt marsh has the distinctive importance in coastal ecosystems. We examined sediment organic carbon stock in the four dominant salt marsh species areas viz. Suaeda maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Salicornia brachiata from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India in two seasons i.e. dry (July 2015) and wet season (January 2016). We examined above ground (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB), sediment physico-chemical properties like pH, BD, composition, OM%, C-org%, C and N%, sediment organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and multivariate analysis on studied variables. Maximum AGB was recorded in A. indicum in both dry and wet season (10.91 +/- 0.15g/cm(2) and 14.87 +/- 0.68g/cm(2)). The highest BGB was observed in S. maritima in both seasons, as 2.01 +/- 0.35g/cm(2) and 4.49 +/- 0.35g/cm(2), respectively. The OM percentage ranged between 4.13 +/-.083 and 7.23 +/-.088% and the highest was observed in the wet season from S. maritima. Sediment organic stocks (Mgha (-1)) ranged from 8.42 +/-.640 to 54.46 +/- 1.46Mgha (-1) reflects nearly 7 times higher than the dry season. The present study can be useful for the estimation of blue carbon budgets in tropical coastal ecosystem since this type was the first hand information from this area.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of natural and modified salt-marsh soils to store organic carbon and their soil properties, we investigated six soil environments located at La Pletera salt-marsh area, NE Spain. Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.

AB  - In coastal wetlands, the effect of vegetation on soil organic carbon (C) quality is not clear. In this study, we investigated soil organic C and total nitrogen (N) in the whole soils, particulate organic matter (POM) and different aggregate fractions in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in Suaeda salsa clusters and bare grounds in the salt marshes of the Liaohe Delta, China. S. salsa increased soil organic C, total N, POMC and POMN concentrations in both soil layers. Interestingly, the presence of S. salsa caused an increase in the amount of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in both 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths, whereas the vegetation effect on microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt- and clay-sized fractions (< 0.053 mm) differed with soil depth. Compared with bare grounds, S. salsa clusters had higher soil organic C and N contents at each aggregate size class. Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest. Our results suggest that vegetation substantially increases the proportion of relatively labile soil organic C and contributes to soil organic C sequestration in tidal salt marshes in the Liaohe Delta, China.

AB  - Ecological attributes were measured along a chronosequence of 1- to 28-yr-old, constructed Spartina alterniflora marshes to identify trajectories and rates of ecosystem development of wetland structure and function. Attributes related to biological productivity and diversity (Spartina, epiphytic and sediment algae, benthic invertebrates), soil development (sediment deposition, organic C, N, P, organic matter quality), and microbial processes (C mineralization) were compared among eight constructed marshes and eight paired natural reference marshes. Most ecological attributes developed in a predictable manner over time, and most achieved equivalence to natural marshes 5-15 yr after marsh construction. An exception was soil organic C and N pools (0-30 cm) that, after 28 yr, were significantly lower in constructed marshes. Development of habitat structure (Spartina stem height and density) and biodiversity (algae and invertebrates) developed concurrently with functional characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll a, and invertebrate density. Processes related to hydrology, sediment deposition and soil C and N accumulation, developed almost instantaneously with the establishment of Spartina, and young (1- to 3-yr-old), constructed marshes trapped sediment and sequestered N at higher rates than comparable reference marshes. Development of heterotrophic activity (C mineralization, invertebrate density) was strongly linked to surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C content. Ecosystem development of constructed (and natural) salt marshes depended on a minimum of 100 9 N/m(2) (0.05-0.1% N) to support emergent vegetation and 1000 g C/m(2) (0.5-1% C) to sustain the heterotrophic community.

AB  - Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Coastal marshes are important blue carbon reservoirs, but it is unclear how vegetation shifts associated with tidal restoration and sea level rise alter soil microbial respiration rates and bacterial community composition. Within 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 without tidal restrictions, 10 tidally restored), we sampled three vegetation zones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phragmites australis to estimate microbial respiration rates (SIR, substrate-induced respiration; carbon mineralization), root zone bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and a suite of plant and soil characteristics. Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.

AB  - As part of research into the re-establishment of the native species Scirpus mariqueter in the salt marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, the roles of revegetation mode (planting density), site characteristics (sediment texture and hydrological regime) and community age (recently restored and mature marshes) in the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) were examined. In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planet's most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

AB  - Isles Dernieres is a transgressive barrier island arc in southeast Louisiana associated with the Bayou Grand Caillou headland of the Lafourche delta complex, which was abandoned 600 to 800 years ago. During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the goal is to identify the soil properties in restored marsh that could be modified to enhance back-barrier marsh habitat.
   Laboratory analyses of 60 cores from four different vegetation density classes in restored marsh and nine cores from natural marshes included bulk density, soil moisture content, grain size, sorting, pH, conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Vegetation density in restored marshes had no significant effect on soil properties, with the exception of bulk density. Marsh type had a significant effect on all measured soil properties. Variations in the soil properties of restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh are primarily the result of differences in soil texture and elevation.

AB  - Thin Layer Placement (TLP) is an increasingly used management technique to promote coastal resilience to accelerated sea level rise, but it is unclear how differential thickness of dredged sediment application alters plantsoil carbon dynamics in northeastern Atlantic coast salt marshes. We initiated a field experiment in a microtidal Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) dominated salt marsh in Connecticut (USA) to examine how a silt-loam dredge applied at different thicknesses (low: +5 cm, medium: +10 cm, and high: +15 cm) altered biological and biogeochemical responses. Over two growing seasons we monitored plant responses (above and belowground biomass, stem height, stem density, leaf area) and soil-biogeochemical parameters (EC, pH, redox, NH4+, sulfides, C:N, decomposition, bulk density, carbon fluxes). We found adding 5-7 cm of dredged sediment promoted rapid revegetation, alleviated phytotoxic sulfides, enhanced CO2 uptake, and reduced CH4 emissions. Low treatments reached similar vegetation cover to controls after one growing season, though sediment treatments greater than 10-cm thick showed delayed growth. Low levels of sediment addition stimulated the highest root biomass in the underlying soil, promoting CO2 efflux, but this was offset by aboveground biomass productivity, promoting net CO2 uptake. Phytotoxic sulfides were reduced in all sediment addition treatments, but our data indicate that coastal managers aiming to promote rapid vegetative recovery while increasing elevation in the short term should target conservative depths (< 10 cm) when using fine-grained dredged material. Collectively, our work will guide wetland managers as they develop restoration specifications for perpetuating coastal marshes in the face of rising seas.

AB  - Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.

AB  - A large imbalance in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs induced by anthropogenic activities is anticipated to profoundly influence soil carbon (C) budgets in salt marshes. In this study, we hypothesized that imbalances in the nitrogen-phosphorus (N-P) input would result in the nonlinear response of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, fractions and mineralization to the N-P input ratio. We applied three N-P input ratios (low (5:1), medium (15:1), high (45:1)) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) for four years (in which N added increased from 8.67 to 26.01 g N m(-2) y(-1) and P added decreased from 1.73 to 0.58 g P m(-2) y(-1)) and quantified their impacts on SOC fractions and SOC mineralisation. The control treatment did not receive fertilization. The results showed that the N and P input led to overall increases in the availability of soil nutrients (i.e., inorganic N (IN) and available P (AP)), stimulation of plant biomass and changes of microbial community structure (i.e., gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). N and P input increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and decreased aromatic DOC components through improving N availability and stimulating plant growth. Notably, though, there may be a threshold N-P input ratio between 15:1 and 45:1 that, once crossed, triggers the loss of SOC. Appropriate increase in N availability induced by low and medium N-P input ratios would stimulate the SOC mineralization. However, excessive N-P input ratio would reduce SOC mineralization. Path analysis indicated that N-P input ratios dominantly regulate SOC mineralisation by changing soil DOC and microbial biomass (MBC)contents and microbial community structure. Thus, we speculate that the continuous increase in N input causes a growing N-P imbalance that reduces SOC stocks, despite a reduction in SOC mineralisation.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration through accumulated plant biomass and storage in soils can potentially make wetland ecosystems net C sinks. Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g Cm-2 day(-1) through plant photosynthesis. About 41-46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6-13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7-44.7 Mg CO2 year(-1) across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was -0.87 to -0.56 g CO2-eq m(-2) day(-1), indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76-$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431-$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink.

AB  - Organic carbon sequestration in salt marsh soils is a function of factors that influence both spatial variability and chemical stability of accumulating carbon. Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

AB  - The work was conducted at La Pletera salt marsh (NE Spain) to investigate the potential for atmospheric carbon capture of perennial Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.

AB  - Wetlands have an inordinate influence on the global greenhouse gas budget, but how global changes may alter wetland contribution to future greenhouse gas fluxes is poorly understood. We determined the greenhouse gas balance of a tidal marsh exposed to nine years of experimental carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) manipulation. We estimated net carbon (C) gain rates by measuring changes in plant and soil C pools over nine years. In wetland soils that accrete primarily through organic matter inputs, long-term measurements of soil elevation, along with soil C density, provide a robust estimate of net soil C gain. We used net soil C gain along with methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to determine the radiative forcing of the marsh under elevated CO2 and N addition. Nearly all plots exhibited a net gain of C over the study period (up to 203 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and C gain rates were greater with N and CO2 addition. Treatment effects on C gain and methane emissions dominated trends in radiative forcing while nitrous oxide fluxes in all treatments were negligible. Though these soils experience salinities that typically suppress methane emissions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 can stimulate methane emissions, overcoming positive effects of elevated CO2 on C gain, converting brackish marshes that are typically net greenhouse gas sinks into sources. Adding resources, either CO2 or N, will likely increase "blue carbon'' accumulation rates in tidal marshes, but importantly, each resource can have distinct influences on the direction of total greenhouse forcing.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are responsible for about half of all carbon burial in oceans, and their persistence as a valuable ecosystem depends largely on the ability to accumulate organic material at rates equivalent to relative sea level rise. Recent work suggests that elevated CO2 and temperature warming will increase organic matter productivity and the ability of marshes to survive sea level rise. However, we find in a series of preliminary experiments that organic decomposition rates increase by about 20% per degree of warming. Our measured temperature sensitivity is similar to studies from terrestrial systems, three times as high as the response of salt marsh productivity to temperature warming, and greater than the productivity response associated with elevated CO2 in C-3 marsh plants. Although the experiments were simple and of short duration, they suggest that enhanced CO2 and warmer temperatures could actually make marshes less resilient to sea level rise, and tend to promote a release of soil carbon. Simple projections indicate that elevated temperatures will increase rates of sea level rise more than any acceleration in organic matter accumulation, suggesting the possibility of a positive feedback between climate, sea level rise, and carbon emissions in coastal environments.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to China in 1979 for the purpose of sediment stabilization and dike protection, and has continuously replaced native plants or invaded bare mudflats in the coastal marsh. To evaluate the spatial variation of CH4 emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S. alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicated that S. alterniflora invasion effectively sequestrated atmospheric CO2 and mitigated GWP in the coastal marsh of China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal seagrass, mangrove and salt-marsh ecosystems-also termed blue-carbon ecosystems-play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Much of the organic carbon they store rests in soils that have accumulated over thousands of years. Rapidly changing climate and environmental conditions, including sea-level rise, warming, eutrophication and landscape development, will impact decomposition and thus the global reservoir of blue soil organic carbon. Yet, it remains unclear how these disturbances will affect the key biogeochemical mechanisms controlling decomposition-mineral protection, redox zonation, water content and movement, and plant-microbe interactions. We assess the spatial and temporal scales over which decomposition mechanisms operate and how their effectiveness may change following disturbances. We suggest that better integration of decomposition mechanisms into blue-carbon models may improve predictions of soil organic carbon stores and facilitate incorporation of coastal vegetated ecosystems into global budgets and management tools.

AB  - Disturbances that remove primary producers and alter substrate chemistry commonly influence ecosystem carbon dynamics. Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.

AB  - We investigated carbon (C) fluxes from Spartina alterniflora community comparing with native C-3-plant (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) communities as well as mudflat in a coastal marsh in eastern China by determining the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and soil respiration (R-SOIL) monthly with static chambers over one year. Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R-ECO and R-AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP. The invasion of S. alterniflora potentially induces a negative feedback to the global climate change by regulating the C sequestration in salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes play a key role in phosphorus (P) retention and cycling; however, they are suffering from small but significant increases in tidal saltwater intrusion. The likely impacts of these low-level saltwater intrusions on P availability and microbial activity are unclear. Here, we investigated soil P speciation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the phoD phosphatase gene community along a freshwater-oligohaline gradient in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The results indicated that with the transition from freshwater to oligohaline water, the levels of soil-water salinity, pH and sulfate content were greater, and ALP activity was lower, which were associated with higher concentrations of organic P, available P, aluminum-bound P, calciumbound P, and occluded P and lower levels of iron-bound P. There was a strong shift in the phoD phosphatase community composition in response to the freshwater-oligohaline gradient. Our findings showed that with the transition from freshwater to an oligohaline environment, in addition to the associated increases in salinity and soil pH and decreases in general microbial and biological activity and soil organic carbon, there is a shift in soil P toward more recalcitrant and immediately available fractions with less labile forms.

AB  - Coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass) sustain the highest rates of carbon sequestration per unit area of all natural systems(1,2), primarily because of their comparatively high productivity and preservation of organic carbon within sedimentary substrates(3). Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.

AB  - The dynamic changes of soil microorganisms after Phragmites oust rails straw addition in the incubation tubes were analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid stable isotope probing (PLEA-SIP). After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - About half of annual marine carbon burial takes place in shallow water ecosystems where geomorphic and ecological stability is driven by interactions between the flow of water, vegetation growth and sediment transport(1). Although the sensitivity of terrestrial and deep marine carbon pools to climate change has been studied for decades, there is little understanding of how coastal carbon accumulation rates will change and potentially feed back on climate(2,3). Here we develop a numerical model of salt marsh evolution, informed by recent measurements of productivity and decomposition, and demonstrate that competition between mineral sediment deposition and organic-matter accumulation determines the net impact of climate change on carbon accumulation in intertidal wetlands. We find that the direct impact of warming on soil carbon accumulation rates is more subtle than the impact of warming-driven sea level rise, although the impact of warming increases with increasing rates of sea level rise. Our simulations suggest that the net impact of climate change will be to increase carbon burial rates in the first half of the twenty-first century, but that carbon-climate feedbacks are likely to diminish over time.

AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as "coastal blue carbon". Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Living shoreline marshes are coastal wetlands constructed as alternatives to "hardened shorelines" (e.g., bulkheads, riprap) to mitigate erosion and to allow for landward migration of intertidal habitat as sea level rises. Living shorelines are designed to mimic natural fringing marshes and over time should be sinks for carbon and other nutrients. We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2-16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most-but not all-living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades. Living shoreline marshes are on trajectories to match natural marsh function with respect to carbon and nutrient storage in estuarine systems.

AB  - Grazers can have a large impact on ecosystem processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.

AB  - Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.

AB  - Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

AB  - Coastal waters are severely threatened by nitrogen (N) loading from direct groundwater discharge. The subterranean estuary, the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and sea water in a coastal aquifer, has a high potential to remove substantial N. A network of piezometers was used to characterize the denitrification capacity and groundwater flow paths in the subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh. "N-enriched nitrate was injected into the subterranean estuary (in situ push-pull method) to evaluate the denitrification capacity of the saturated zone at multiple depths (125300 cm) below different zones (upland-marsh transition zone, high marsh, and low marsh). From the upland to low marsh, the water table became shallower, groundwater dissolved oxygen decreased, and groundwater pH, soil organic carbon, and total root biomass increased. As groundwater approached the high and low marsh, the hydraulic gradient increased and deep groundwater upwelled. In the warm season (groundwater temperature > 12 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity within each zone was observed. The warm season low marsh groundwater denitrification capacity was significantly higher than all other zones and depths. In the cool season (groundwater temperature < 10.5 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity was only found in the low marsh. Additions of dissolved organic carbon did not alter groundwater denitrification capacity suggesting that an alternative electron donor, possibly transported by tidal inundation from the root zone, may be limiting. Combining flow paths with denitrification capacity and saturated porewater residence time, we estimated that as much as 29-60 mg N could be removed from 11 of water flowing through the subterranean estuary below the low marsh, arguing for the significance of subterranean estuaries in annual watershed scale N budgets.

AB  - Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

AB  - The exotic species smooth cordgrass (Spartina alternifiora) is recognized as an important invasive species in China, introduced about 40 years ago. The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis. The succession of macrofaunal communities should be considered as a comprehensive response to the variations on environmental properties co-varying with smooth cordgrass invasion in coastal wetlands.

AB  - A reasonable predicting model for spatial variation of soil carbon would be a useful tool in monitoring and restoration of salt marshes. In this study, radial basis function neural networks model (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks model (BPNN) were built to predict total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. Both models contained thirteen input parameters, i.e., nine topographic factors selected from ASTER GDEM Version2 and Geographical Information System (GIS), one vegetation index - MODIS 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and three soil physicochemical properties. For prediction of TC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 61.87%, 81.36% and 56.82%; for TOC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 37.13%, 58.06% and 35.23%; both models had no significant difference in accuracy for DOC prediction, but the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller. All ME values of RBFNN rather than BPNN were closer to zero. RBFNN integrating environmental factors had a higher accuracy than BPNN in predicting soil carbon content at a relatively small regional scale.

AB  - Global vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) represent a large sink for organic carbon (OC) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 +/- 0.6, 7.5 +/- 0.6, and 1.6 +/- 0.6 Tg C (+/- 95% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 +/- 17, 159 +/- 57, and 6 +/- 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

AB  - 1 Plant and microbial nitrogen (N) dynamics were examined in soils of an Arctic salt marsh beneath goose-grazed swards and in degraded soils. The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth.
   2 In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of (NH4Cl)-N-15 into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial N-15 excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of N-15. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated N-15 such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils.
   3 The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer.
   4 Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of N-15 in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion.
   5 Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention.

AB  - Coastal wetlands accumulate soil carbon more efficiently than terrestrial systems, but sea-level rise potentially threatens the persistence of this prominent carbon sink. Here, we combine a published dataset of 372 soil carbon accumulation rates from across the United States with new analysis of 131 sites in coastal Louisiana and find that the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) explains 80% of regional variation in carbon accumulation. A carbon mass balance for the rapidly submerging Louisiana coast demonstrates that carbon accumulation rates in surviving marshes increase with RSLR and currently exceed the rate of carbon loss due to marsh drowning and erosion. Although continued erosion will eventually lead to net carbon loss, our results suggest a strong negative carbon-climate feedback for coastal marshes, where even submerging marshes sequester carbon at rates that increase with RSLR.

AB  - Variations in the soil carbon sequestration capability of different types of salt marsh soils at Chongming Dongtan and its influencing factors were studied by analyzing the soil organic carbon (SOC) content, organic matter input and microbial activities. The results indicated that the total SOC content at Area A (southeast of Dongtan, sandy soil with Phragmites communis) was only 46.11% of that of Area B (northeast of Dongtan, clay soil with mixed P. communis and Spartina alterniflora)(P= 0.000 < 0.05), but their organic matter input per year was almost identical. These findings implied that Area B had a lower output of SOC. The microbial biomass at Area A was 3.83 times greater than that at Area B (P= 0.049 < 0.05); the soil catalase and invertase activities at Area A, which were related to carbon metabolism, were 60.31% (P=0.006 < 0.05) and 34.33% (P=0.021 < 0.05) higher than at Area B, respectively; and the soil respiration at Area A was also higher than at Area B. These findings implied that the microbial activities at Area A were greater than those at Area B, and therefore the carbon metabolism was rapid, resulting in increased SOC output at Area A. Increased water content and salinity in the clay soil at Area B may inhibit the microbial activities, thereby reducing the decomposition of the organic matter and enhancing carbon sequestration. In addition, some artificial measures for controlling spread of S. alterniflora at Area B (mowing/digging and tillage (M + D); mowing/digging and tillage/waterlogging (M + D + W)) were found to generally improve the microbial activity of soil, thereby increasing SOC output. However, when the two different physical controlling modes were compared, the SOC and microbial activities of the soil subjected to the M + D + W treatment were relatively high and low, respectively, due to waterlogging restraining the microbial metabolism. These findings indicated that the difference in microbial activities was the important factor leading to variability in the SOC sequestration capability between Areas A and B. Additionally, with the exception of soil texture and vegetation types, environmental conditions and artificial turbulence also influenced microbial activities of soil, and hence SOC output and organic carbon sequestration capability.

AB  - Research into biotic interactions has been a core theme of ecology for over a century. However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, affected by plant invasion, are not fully understood. In this study, the impact of 10 years Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic matter (SOM), labile, and recalcitrant pools was examined comparing with bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities in tidal salt marshes of the Eastern Chinese coast. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly raised C and N concentrations in SOM, labile and recalcitrant pools compared to bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils. Spartina alterniflora soil had higher recalcitrant index for C relative to bare flat. The proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C and the decomposition rate of old C in the labile pool were significantly higher than those in the recalcitrant pool. However, the S. alterniflora-derived C stock of the recalcitrant pool was much greater than that of the labile pool. The SOM and recalcitrant pools in S. alterniflora soil had significantly higher delta N-15 levels compared with bare flat, indicating an increased N loss following S. alterniflora invasion. The results suggested that short- term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enlarged soil organic C and N pools via altering SOM input and decomposition.

AB  - Intertidal wetlands capture and store carbon (C) for long periods of time, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Yet the processes, which govern the decomposition and subsequent long-term storage of organic matter (OM) and C in these habitats, remain poorly understood. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) uses a standardized OM (green and Rooibos tea) and has the potential to shed light on OM decomposition across habitats, including saltmarshes. Here, we apply the TBI method at two saltmarshes within the same estuary with the aim of (i) reducing the influence of climatic variables and (ii) determining the role of the environment, including the soil characteristics, in the decomposition of OM. We extended the standard (3 months) incubation period over a full year in order to investigate the longer-term decomposition processes at each site. The initial results partially support previous studies that the early stages of decomposition (leaching of the water-soluble fraction) is governed by climatic conditions, but may be further enhanced by tidal flushing in saltmarshes. By extending the incubation period, we observed the initiation of midstage OM decomposition (cellulose degradation) upon which the soil characteristics appear to be the dominant control. These results highlight the importance of long-term TBI incubations to understand early-stage OM decomposition. The relationship between tea mass (OM) loss and C loss in these intertidal environments is not straightforward, and we would caution the use of the TBI as a direct universal proxy for soil C degradation in such intertidal wetlands.

AB  - Suaeda salsa is a pioneer species in coastal wetlands of East Asia and recently an ecosystem engineer species, Phragmites australis, has started to enter into S. salsa communities owing to either autogenic or external drivers. The consequences of this phenomenon on the ecosystem functions of coastal wetlands are still unclear, especially for decomposition processes. Here we compared the decomposition rate of S. salsa litter, and associated litter chemistry dynamics, between sites with and without P. australis encroachment. We conducted a litter transplantation experiment to tease apart the effects of litter quality and decomposing environment or decomposer community composition. Our results showed that P. australis encroachment led to higher carbon and phosphorus losses of S. salsa litter, but equal losses of total mass, lignin, hemicellulose and nitrogen. Phragmites australis encroachment might affect decomposition rate indirectly by making S. salsa produce litter with higher lignin concentrations or via increasing the fungal diversity for decomposition. Moreover, P. australis as an ecosystem engineer might also alter the allocation of total phosphorus between the plants and the soils in coastal wetlands. Our findings indicate that P. australis could impact aboveground and belowground carbon and nutrient dynamics in coastal wetlands, and highlight the important consequences that encroaching plant species, especially ecosystem engineers, can have on ecosystem functions and services of coastal wetlands, not only in East Asia but probably also elsewhere in the world.

AB  - Climate greatly influences the structure and functioning of tidal saline wetland ecosystems. However, there is a need to better quantify the effects of climatic drivers on ecosystem properties, particularly near climate-sensitive ecological transition zones. Here, we used climate- and literature-derived ecological data from tidal saline wetlands to test hypotheses regarding the influence of climatic drivers (i.e., temperature and precipitation regimes) on the following six ecosystem properties: canopy height, biomass, productivity, decomposition, soil carbon density, and soil carbon accumulation. Our analyses quantify and elucidate linear and nonlinear effects of climatic drivers. We quantified positive linear relationships between temperature and above-ground productivity and strong positive nonlinear (sigmoidal) relationships between (1) temperature and above-ground biomass and canopy height and (2) precipitation and canopy height. Near temperature-controlled mangrove range limits, small changes in temperature are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in biomass and canopy height, as mangrove forests grow, expand, and, in some cases, replace salt marshes. However, within these same transition zones, temperature-induced changes in productivity are expected to be comparatively small. Interestingly, despite the significant above-ground height, biomass, and productivity relationships across the tropical-temperate mangrove-marsh transition zone, the relationships between temperature and soil carbon density or soil carbon accumulation were not significant. Our literature review identifies several ecosystem properties and many regions of the world for which there are insufficient data to fully evaluate the influence of climatic drivers, and the identified data gaps can be used by scientists to guide future research. Our analyses indicate that near precipitation-controlled transition zones, small changes in precipitation are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in canopy height. However, there are scant data to evaluate the influence of precipitation on other ecosystem properties. There is a need for more decomposition data across climatic gradients, and to advance understanding of the influence of changes in precipitation and freshwater availability, additional ecological data are needed from tidal saline wetlands in arid climates. Collectively, our results can help scientists and managers better anticipate the linear and nonlinear ecological consequences of climate change for coastal wetlands.

AB  - The exotic smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has invaded intertidal wetlands near the Ronggenshan tidal flats of Beihai, Guangxi, China, where historically seagrasses and mangroves coexisted. We investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage and macrobenthic community structure in the existing mangroves (MG), S. alterniflora (SA), seagrass bed (SG), and unvegetated flat (UnV) habitats following the S. alterniflora invasion. SOC storage increased after S. alternifolia invasion in the SG and UnV habitats. Spartina alterniflora invasion changed the dominant species of the macrobenthos in the original habitats and reduced the diversity of macrobenthos in SG and UnV habitats. Clearly, S. alternifolia invasion can change the ecological functioning of south China's coastal ecosystems by altering carbon sequestration and affecting biodiversity.

AB  - Labile fractions of soil carbon pools are sensitive to environmental changes, which would influence the stabilization of soil carbon. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species originating from North America, has spread widely along the eastern coast of China. However, the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on CH4 and N2O fluxes from salt marshes in eastern China are not fully understood. We conducted a field experiment in three treatments (transparent, opaque, and clipping) to compare the CH4 and N2O fluxes from S. alterniflora community with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities and the mudflat in a coastal wetland of eastern China over one year. CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora community was higher than the S. salsa community and mudflat but lower than the P. australis community. The opaque treatment did not significantly alter CH4 flux, except for the S. salsa community. Clipping significantly decreased CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but increased CH4 flux from the S. salsa community. In contrast, N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities were lower than for the S. salsa community and mudflat. The opaque treatment did not significantly change N2O fluxes across communities. Clipping significantly increased mean N2O fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but did not significantly change N2O flux in the S. salsa community. CH4 flux was positively related to the aboveground biomass and negatively related to density, whereas N2O flux was negatively related to aboveground biomass and positively related to density. Meanwhile, CH4 flux was strongly dependent on temperature, soil moisture and water depth (P < 0.05), while N2O fluxes under the transparent and opaque chambers were significantly related to water depth (P < 0.05), but N2O flux under the clipping treatment was not significantly related to environmental factors (P > 0.05). Overall, CH4 and N2O fluxes from this coastal wetland were 17.38g m (2) and -36.64 mg m (2), respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasions in this salt marsh in eastern China could play a negligible role in emitting CH4 and a significant role in absorbing N2O when compared with other studies worldwide.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora exhibits great invading potential in the coastal marsh ecosystems. Also, nitrogen (N) deposition shows an apparent increase in the east of China. To evaluate CH4 emissions in the coastal marsh as affected by the invasion of S. alterniflora and N deposition, we measured CH4 emission from brackish marsh mesocosms vegetated with S. alterniflora and a native plant, Suaeda salsa, and fertilized with exogenous N at the rates of 0 and 2.7 g N m(-2), respectively. Dissolved porewater CH4 concentration and redox potentials in soils as well as aboveground biomass and stem density of plants were also monitored. The averaged rate of CH4 emission during the growing season in the S. alterniflora and S. salsa mesocosms without N application was 0.88 and 0.54 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively, suggesting that S. alterniflora plants significantly increased CH4 emission mainly because of higher plant biomass rather than stem density compared to S. salsa, which delivered more substrates to the soil for methanogenesis. Exogenous N input dramatically stimulated CH4 emission by 71.7% in the S. alterniflora mesocosm. This increase was attributable to enhancement in biomass and particularly stem density of S. alterniflora driven by N application, which transported greater photosynthesis products than oxygen into soils for CH4 production and provided more pathways for CH4 emission. In contrast, there was no significant effect of N fertilization on CH4 emission in the S. salsa mesocosm. Although N fertilization significantly stimulated CH4 production by increasing S. salsa biomass, no significant increase in stem density was observed. This fact, along with the low gas transport capacity of S. salsa, failed to efficiently transport CH4 from wetlands into the atmosphere. Thus we argue that the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of N fertilization on CH4 emission from wetlands might depend on the gas transport capacity of plants and their relative contribution to substrates for CH4 production and oxygen for CH4 oxidation in soil.

AB  - Although embankment reclamation is a recurring activity in the coastal wetlands of China, the effect of embankment construction on plant growth has attracted little attention. Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'. However, previously published threshold values of the N:P ratio as indicators of N or P limitation of plant growth may not be applicable to S. alterniflora at our study site.

AB  - The coastal wetlands of eastern China form one of the most important carbon sinks in the world. However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.

AB  - We compared the influence of invasion by an alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, smooth cordgrass) and a native aggressive species (Phragmites australis, common reed) as they have expanded into the native Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass)-dominated wetland ecosystem in the Min River estuary of southeast China. S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) was introduced to China in December 1979 to buffer against fides and to accelerate coastal wetland accretion. Since then, its propagation and natural dispersal have allowed this exotic plant to rapidly expand throughout coastal China with generally negative ecological effects. In 2003 S. alterniflora was labeled as an invasive plant in China, and it now covers similar to 50,000 ha. In this review, we first summarize the mechanisms of spread and spatial distribution of S. alterniflora, and how its physiological characteristics and strong adaptability to the available niche space in China's wetlands have enabled its spread and competition with native plants. Then we review the effects of S. alterniflora on ecosystem function in terms of habitat conversion and the alteration of biodiversity, soil carbon flux and sequestration, and various processes of nutrient regulation. We conclude that we need a long-term and context-dependent perspective, in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of S. alterniflora within each of China's unique provinces.

AB  - Mangrove wetland restoration and creation efforts are increasingly proposed as mechanisms to compensate for mangrove wetland losses. However, ecosystem development and functional equivalence in restored and created mangrove wetlands are poorly understood. We compared a 20-year chronosequence of created tidal wetland sites in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) to natural reference mangrove wetlands. Across the chronosequence, our sites represent the succession from salt marsh to mangrove forest communities. Our results identify important soil and plant structural differences between the created and natural reference wetland sites; however, they also depict a positive developmental trajectory for the created wetland sites that reflects tightly coupled plant-soil development. Because upland soils and/or dredge spoils were used to create the new mangrove habitats, the soils at younger created sites and at lower depths (10-30 cm) had higher bulk densities, higher sand content, lower soil organic matter (SOM), lower total carbon (TC), and lower total nitrogen (TN) than did natural reference wetland soils. However, in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), SOM, TC, and TN increased with created wetland site age simultaneously with mangrove forest growth. The rate of created wetland soil C accumulation was comparable to literature values for natural mangrove wetlands. Notably, the time to equivalence for the upper soil layer of created mangrove wetlands appears to be faster than for many other wetland ecosystem types. Collectively, our findings characterize the rate and trajectory of above- and below-ground changes associated with ecosystem development in created mangrove wetlands; this is valuable information for environmental managers planning to sustain existing mangrove wetlands or mitigate for mangrove wetland losses.

AB  - Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world in terms of ecosystem service value, and the strategic management of their carbon resources is an important part of climate change mitigation. Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained similar to 46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors. This synthetic work can provide a better understanding of how changing environmental and social conditions can lead to enhanced or degraded carbon sequestration rates in times of rapid global change.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in mitigating global warming. To evaluate the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on global warming potential (GWP) in Chinese coastal areas, we measured CH4 and N2O fluxes and soil organic carbon sequestration rates along a transect of coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province, China, including open water; bare tidal flat; and invasive S. alterniflora, native Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis marshes. Annual CH4 emissions were estimated as 2.81, 4.16, 4.88, 10.79, and 16.98kg CH(4)ha(-1) for open water, bare tidal flat, and P. australis, S. salsa, and S. alterniflora marshes, respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasion increased CH4 emissions by 57-505%. In contrast, negative N2O fluxes were found to be significantly and negatively correlated (P<0.001) with net ecosystem CO2 exchange during the growing season in S. alterniflora and P. australis marshes. Annual N2O emissions were 0.24, 0.38, and 0.56kg N(2)Oha(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat and S. salsa marsh, respectively, compared with -0.51kg N(2)Oha(-1) for S. alterniflora marsh and -0.25kg N(2)Oha(-1) for P. australis marsh. The carbon sequestration rate of S. alterniflora marsh amounted to 3.16 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1) in the top 100cm soil profile, a value that was 2.63- to 8.78-fold higher than in native plant marshes. The estimated GWP was 1.78, -0.60, -4.09, and -1.14Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1)yr(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat, P. australis marsh and S. salsa marsh, respectively, but dropped to -11.30Mg CO(2)eqha(-1)yr(-1) in S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicate that although S. alterniflora invasion stimulates CH4 emissions, it can efficiently mitigate increases in atmospheric CO2 and N2O along the coast of China.

AB  - History revealed that people had been discharging a large proportion of carbon into the atmosphere through fossil fuel consumption and the marine environment. These have prompted atmospheric carbon fixations that have proved to be larger than at any other point throughout the human survival. Due to the critical role of blue carbon in the ocean carbon cycle, it is essential to pay extra attention to these habitats (mangrove, seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and coral reefs). Hence, this article reviews the recent developments in blue carbon biomass estimation using a geospatial approach and highlighted the blue carbon components achievements and gaps. Biomass and soil carbon estimation, using change detection analysis, were reviewed. Analysis of the carbon conversion factors, used in converting biomass to carbon, was demonstrated. The review shall act as support for the realization of the target 14.2 and 14.5 of the 14(th) sustainable development goal established by the United Nations, to fast track the achievement of the 2020 agenda.

AB  - The south-American cordgrass, Spartina densiflora, has become the dominant plant species on recent tidal marsh restorations in the Donana National Park (SW Spain). We examined the effect of different doses of glyphosate (720-7200 ga.i.ha(-1)) and imazamox (20-68 ga.i.ha(-1)) on growth and photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora. Imazamox had no effect on neither on growth nor photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora. On the contrary, glyphosate inhibited photochemical efficiency of photosynthesis from day one. Net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic pigments and the number of new tillers were reduced. Glyphosate at high doses (ca. 7200 g.a.i. ha(-1)) could be an appropriate method of control, since it has a negative effect over the photosynthetic apparatus and growth of S. densiflora. Furthermore, glyphosate and its main metabolite, AMPA, were not extracted from the soil, since they were retained by the very high iron and aluminum oxide content of this soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Straw addition can increase the content of soil organic carbon (SOC), and affect the content of aggregates and organic carbon fractions. The changes in aggregates and organic carbon fractions in the natural salt marsh, 10-year and 15-year freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary were studied by 120-day field in situ culture experiments with Phragmites australis straw addition. The results showed that straw addition mainly enhanced the soil aggregate stability in the 10-year freshwater pumping area, and the organic carbon content of small macro-aggregates increased significantly by 26.36% (P < 0.05). In particular, the content of coarse particulate organic carbon (cPOC) with small macro-aggregates in all areas increased significantly with the addition of straw (P < 0.05). For small macro-aggregates in the 10-year pumping area, the cPOC contents increased significantly by 21.73 g/kg (P < 0.05); and were significantly higher than the fine particulate organic carbon (fPOC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (mSOC) contents, as the fPOC contents in micro-aggregates increased by 85.92% (P < 0.05). Additionally, the cPOC contents of small macro-aggregates and fPOC contents of micro aggregates increased by 34.59% and 43.24% in the 15-year pumping area. The contents of mSOC were the lowest in different aggregates across all areas. Thus, straw addition had a significant effect on the contents of cPOC and fPOC, while freshwater pumping in the YRE could affect the distribution of fPOC and mSOC with aggregates.

AB  - Aiming to uncover the effects of tidewater and crab burrowing on sulfur cycling of Spartina alterniflora marsh, a field experiment was carried out at Jiangsu Yancheng Wetland National Nature Reserve. H2S flux, plant sulfur storage and total sulfur of sediments in S. alterniflora marsh were measured under different tidewater and crab burrows treatments. Results showed that crab burrows significantly increased H2S emission from S. alterniflora marsh, while no significant effect on H2S emission by tidewater was detected. Both tidewater and crab burrows had no significant effects on plant sulfur storage except that the crab burrows significantly decreased it in the seeding season. Tidewater only significantly impacted total sulfur in sediments of 0-30 cm depth, while those in soil of 0-20 and 40-50 cm depths were significantly affected by crab burrows. Total sulfur in sediments affected by tidewater and crab burrows exhibited a seasonal variation. The findings of this study indicated that both tidewater and crab burrowing were key disturbing factors affecting sulfur cycling in S. alterniflora marsh but in different aspects.

AB  - In coastal marshes, low-permeability mud is often found overlying high permeability sandy deposits. A recently developed 3D creek-marsh model was used to investigate the effects of soil stratigraphy (a mud layer overlying a sandy-loam layer) on pore-water flow in the marsh. Simulation results showed significant modifications of tide-induced pore-water flow due to the layered soil. The presence of the lower sandy-loam layer with a relatively high hydraulic conductivity not only increased the pore-water flow speed but also changed the flow direction, particularly in the upper mud layer where enhanced vertical flow dominated. Particle tracking revealed large changes in the overall pore-water circulation pattern, and associated particle travel path and time due to the influence of the soil stratigraphy. While the amount of water exchange between the marsh soil and tidal water increased, the residence time of particles in both soil layers was reduced. Sensitivity analysis showed the importance of soil compressibility, capillary rise and hydraulic conductivity contrast between the soil layers in modulating the effect of soil stratigraphy. In particular, the total net influx and efflux across the marsh surface (including the creek/channel bank and bed) increased proportionally with the square root of the lower layer's hydraulic conductivity. These results demonstrated the interplay of tides, marsh topography and soil stratigraphy in controlling the pore-water flow characteristics, which underpin solute transport and transformation as well as the aeration condition in the marsh soil.

AB  - The exotic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the mangrove wetlands in southern China and ecological restoration using native mangroves was conducted in an attempt to control this invasive species. In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

AB  - Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.

AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the soil carbon storage and sequestration rates of undisturbed natural wetlands and disturbed wetlands subject to restriction of tidal flow and subsequent rehabilitation in an Australian estuary. Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15% for mangrove and 55% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65% for mangrove and 60% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95% for mangrove and 345% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

AB  - Mangroves are critical in global carbon budget while vulnerable to exotic plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora, one of typical salt marsh plant grows forcefully along the coast of China, has invaded the native mangrove habitats in Zhangjiang Estuary. However, the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on soil carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission from mangroves are not fully understood. Accordingly, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the soil CH4 and CO2 emission during growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 at four adjacent wetlands, namely bare mudflat (Mud), Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM) and S. alterniflora (SA). Potential methane production (PMP), potential methane oxidation (PMO), functional microbial abundance and soil biogeochemical properties were measured simultaneously. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion could dramatically increase soil CH4 emissions mainly due to the enhancement in PMP which facilitated by soil EC, MBC, TOC and mcrA gene abundance. Additionally, S. alterniflora invasion decreases soil CO2 emission. Both heterotrophic microbial respiration (165 rRNA) and methane oxidation (pmoA and ANME-pmoA) are responsible for CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, S. alterniflora invasion greatly increases GWP by stimulating CH4 emissions. Thus, comparing with mangroves, invasive S. alterniflora significantly (p < 0.001) increases CH4 emission while reduces CO2 emission.

AB  - Soils from two typical tidal salt marshes with varied salinity in the Yellow River Delta wetland were analysed to determine possible effects of salinity on soil carbon sequestration through changes in soil microbiology. The mean soil respiration (SR) of the salt water-fresh water mixing zone (MZ) was 2.89 times higher than that of the coastal zone (CZ) (4.73 and 1.63molm(-2)s(-1), respectively, p<.05), and soil dehydrogenase activity was the main microbial factor influencing SR. In addition to the higher soil microbial biomass, the MZ had more -Proteobacteria than the CZ, as well as some specific bacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity such as Pseudomonas sp. and Limnobacter sp. that might have led to its higher dehydrogenase activity and respiratory rates. Additionally, the CZ possessed more Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with the ability to fix CO2 than the MZ. Significantly lower soil salinity in MZ (4.25gkg(-1)) was suitable for -Proteobacteria, but detrimental for Halobacteria compared with CZ (7.09gkg(-1), p<.01), which might lead to the lower microbial decomposition capacity of soils in CZ. As a result, the CZ has a higher soil organic carbon content than the MZ.

AB  - Under a changing climate, coastal wetlands experience sea level rise, warming, and vegetation change, all of which may influence organic matter mineralization. In coastal wetlands of subtropical west-central Florida (USA), we investigated how soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization respond to soil water, temperature, and ecosystem type (Avicennia germinans mangrove forest vs. Juncus roemerianus salt marsh). We evaluated how soil respiration and mineral N concentration varied along a soil moisture gradient, and whether these relationships differed between ecosystem types. Then, we manipulated soils in a 28-d laboratory incubation to evaluate how potentially mineralizable C and N respond to temperature (23 vs. 27 degrees C), soil hydroperiod (inundated 4 vs. 20 h/d), and soil source. Soil saturation and inundation suppressed short-term (minutes to weeks) C mineralization from near-surface soils. Soil CO2 efflux declined by 65% as soil moisture increased from 75% to 85%, and potentially mineralizable C was 18% lower with a 20-h hydroperiod than with a 4-h hydroperiod. Organic C quality appears to be greater in A. germinans than in J. roemerianus soils, as A. germinans soils had higher field CO2 efflux rates and greater mineralizable C:N (despite lower total C:N). Increasing incubation temperature from 23 to 27 degrees C elevated potentially mineralizable C by 40%, indicating that two symptoms of climate change (increased inundation from sea level rise, and warming) may have opposing effects on soil C mineralization. Temperature sensitivity of C mineralization was high for long-hydroperiod soils, however, suggesting that protection of soil organic matter (SUM) due to prolonged inundation will be undermined by warming. Potentially mineralizable N was greater in J. roemerianus soils, although in situ mineral N was not different between ecosystems, instead correlating positively with SOM. These results indicate that models forecasting soil elevation responses to climate change might include inundation effects on mineralization rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem processes are tightly linked to the structure and functioning of plant communities. Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes. Our study indicates that instead of CO2 being simply incorporated into PCS and SCS, carbon dynamics following Spartina invasion are more complicated. Detailed studies of CH4 emissions are needed before ascertaining whether, and to what degree, the invasion of S. alterniflora may affect the global warming process.

AB  - The creation and restoration of wetlands is widely seen as a critical tool for replacing ecosystem functions lost by historic wetland destruction. However, studies have shown that these wetlands often take hundreds of years to achieve the functions for which they are restored. We used controlled field-scale manipulations in four recently restored depressional freshwater wetlands in western New York to investigate the impact of organic amendments of differing lability on the soil and vegetative development during the first 3 yr. Results showed that the addition of soil amendments to wetland plots stimulates development of key soil properties that are critical for wetland functioning. In particular, initial increases in soil C and decreases in bulk density in topsoil and biochar amended plots were still present 3 yr after restoration. Plant biomass recovered quickly and had reached levels of comparable natural wetlands within 2 yr, irrespective of amendments. Amendments did not influence plant diversity. Site differences, however, did influence plant diversity and different sites hosted different numbers and types of species. Two years after restoration, both desirable native wetland species and undesirable weedy species had colonized each site. Results of this research reveal that organic amendments can improve key soil properties critical for wetland functioning. The strength of treatment effects and the development of the plant community, however, are highly influenced by initial site conditions. These results confirm the importance of focusing on both hastening soil development via amendments and careful site selection in restoration design.

AB  - Wetland restoration significantly affects ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycles by changing soil physicochemical properties and plant properties. To reveal the effect of wetland restora-tion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage, we measured the SOC and TN content and calculated their storage in a restoration chronosequence (1, 4, 8, 13, 17, 27 years) and compared them with those in a soybean field and a natural marsh, all in Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. Our results showed that the SOC and TN content and storage in the in-vestigated sites increased with restoration time. However, the restoration rate was faster in the first 8 years but slowed down after 8 years of restoration. The SOC and TN content and storage decreased with soil depths in the eight sites. After 27 years of restoration, the carbon and nitrogen storage in the restored site was 2.8 and 1.9 times that in the soybean field, respec-tively. However, the SOC and TN storage in the 27-year restored site was 45.3% and 35.1% lower than that in the natural marsh, respectively. The SOC and TN content, bulk density, moisture content, clay, and plant belowground biomass significantly impact the SOC and TN storage (P < 0.01). This study indicates that marsh restoration contributes to the accumulation of SOC and TN, but the restoration of SOC and TN storage to the level of natural marshes may take decades.

AB  - Plant invasion typically alters the microbial communities of soils, which affects ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. The responses of the soil fungal communities to plant invasion along its chronosequence remain poorly understood. For this study, we investigated variations in soil fungal communities through Illumina MiSeq sequencing analyses of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), along a chronosequence (i.e., 9-, 13-, 20- and 23-year-old) of invasive Spartina alterniflora. We compared these variations with those of bare flat in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland. Our results highlighted that the abundance of soil fungi, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), species richness, and Shannon diversity indices for soil fungal communities were highest in 9-year-old S. alterniflora soil, which gradually declined along the invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of copiotrophic Basidiomycota revealed significant decreasing trend, while the relative abundance of oligotrophic Ascomycota gradually increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of soil saprotrophic fungi (e.g., undefined saprotrophs) was gradually reduced while symbiotic fungi (e.g., ectomycorrhizal fungi) and pathotrophic fungi (e.g., plant and animal pathogens) progressively increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. Our results suggested that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil fungal abundance and diversity, community composition, trophic modes, and functional groups along a chronosequence, via substantially reduced soil litter inputs, and gradually decreased soil pH, moisture, and soil nutrient substrates along the invasion chronosequence, from 9 to 23 years. These changes in soil fungal communities, particularly their trophic modes and functional groups along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence could well impact the decomposition and accumulation of soil C and N. while potentially altering ecosystem C and N sinks in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The rapid spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the mangrove ecosystems of China was reduced using Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. as an ecological replacement. Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi'ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi'ao Island. These results indicate that ecological replacement methods can enhance long term carbon storage in Spartina-invaded ecosystems and native mangrove species are recommended.

AB  - Aims
   Although many studies have reported net gains of soil organic carbon (SOC) after afforestation on croplands, this is uncertain for Chinese paddy rice croplands. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of afforestation of paddy rice croplands on SOC sequestration and soil respiration (R-s). Such knowledge would improve our understanding of the effectiveness of various land use options on greenhouse gas mitigation in China.
   Methods
   The investigation was conducted on the Chongming Island, north subtropical China. Field sites were reclaimed from coastal salt marshes in the 1960s, and soils were homogeneous with simple land use histories. SOC stocks and R-s levels were monitored over one year in a paddy rice cropland, an evergreen and a deciduous broad-leaved plantation established on previous paddy fields and a reference fallow land site never cultivated. Laboratory incubation of soil under fast-changing temperatures was used to compare the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC decomposition across land uses.
   Important Findings
   After 15-20 years of afforestation on paddy fields, SOC concentration only slightly increased at the depth of 0-5 cm but decreased in deeper layers, which resulted in a net loss of SOC stock in the top 40 cm. Seasonal increase of SOC was observed during the rice-growing period in croplands but not in afforested soils, suggesting a stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping. However, SOC sequestered under cropping was more labile, as indicated by its higher contents of dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass. Also, paddy soils had higher annual R-s than afforested soils; R-s abruptly increased after paddy fields were drained and plowed and remained distinctively high throughout the dry farming period. Laboratory incubation revealed that paddy soils had a much higher Q(10) of SOC decomposition than afforested soils.. Given that temperature was the primary controller of R-s in this region, it was concluded that despite the stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping, its SOC was less stable than in afforested systems and might be more easily released into the atmosphere under global warming.

AB  - Mangroves play an important role in enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient pools. The exotic Sonneratia apetala is widely used for the restoration of mangroves in China because of its fast growth. However, it is not clear whether S. apetala increases SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools compared with the native mangrove species. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine whether Kandelia obovata and the fast-growing mangrove species S. apetala have advantages with regard to the SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools and whether restored mangroves have SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools similar to those of original mangroves. Four sites in the Qi'aoDangan Provincial Nature Reserve were selected: a 15-year-old planted S. apetala forest, a 15-year-old planted K. obovata forest, a native K. obovata forest, and an unvegetated mudflat. The content and pools of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the soil were compared. Compared with mudflats, the content and pools of SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus were significantly increased by planting S. apetala. However, compared with the 15-year-old planted K. obovata, the fast-growing S. apetala showed no advantage. The content and pools of SOC and nitrogen in the 15-year-old planted S. apetala site were lower than those of native K. obovata forests. It is recommended that more native mangrove species be used for future mangrove restoration to increase the content and pools of SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

AB  - Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.

AB  - Plant invasion has been reported to alter ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes and pools. The mechanisms involved in how plant invasion affects the soil microbial community-the primary mediator of soil C and N cycling-remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of plant invasion on the soil microbial community in a coastal wetland of eastern China.
   We investigated the impact of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on the soil microbial community structure based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis and chloroform fumigation-extraction by comparing it to that of bare flat and native C-3 plants Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities.
   Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil microbial biomass C and the total and various types of PLFAs compared with bare flat, Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Increased concentrations of soil moisture, electrical conductivity, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total, labile and recalcitrant soil organic C and N, and decreased soil pH in Spartina alterniflora community explained 65.9 % of the total variability in the PLFAs. WSOC and soil labile organic N were strongly correlated with PLFAs, whereas soil pH was negatively related to PLFAs.
   A 10-year Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil microbial biomass and community structure by increasing available substrate. The changes in soil microbial biomass and community structure may in turn enhance soil C and N sequestration in a coastal wetland of eastern China.

AB  - Tidal flats form around the estuarine and coastal zone by continuous terrigenous sediment transport and deposition processes. Now a large body of published carbon research work frame within the vegetated area (mangrove forests, sea grass bed, and salt marshes). Nonvegetated tidal flats, which are characterized by predominantly silts and clays sediment, were generally impressed with low carbon stock due to their meager primary productivity. However, these regions may be a potentially important carbon sink, given their high burial rate, expanding areal coverage, and detrial organic carbon derived from watershed and adjacent vegetated area. Low carbon densities (<0.01 g cm(-3)) were found in Chinese tidal flat sediments by the study, but the carbon sequestration rates ranged from 35 to 361 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which were comparable to rates of worldwide vegetated coastal areas. The high rates can be ascribed to rapid sedimentation rates (1-2 cm yr(-1)) during the past several decades. The highest areal carbon stocks were located at tidal flat sites proximal to mangrove forests. The majority of carbon stocks (100 cm) was found in the unvegetated tidal flats instead of in the vegetated tidal flats. The former occupied 87% of the entire tidal area, 6.7 times larger than the latter. Tidal flats in coastal China store 78.07 Tg C (100 cm), accounting for nearly 80% of the C deposited in entire coastal tidal area. The future carbon sequestration rates of Chinese tidal flats are facing uncertainties under the pressures of reduced fluvial sediment loads from major rivers.

AB  - In order to explore the impact of land-use change on carbon (C) stocks in South West England, three scenarios were explored based on current UK national- and regional-scale policies and plans. The scenarios assessed were: (i) Rebuilding Biodiversity (RB), involving habitat restoration of 824,244 ha of strategic nature areas; (ii) Forest Strategy (FS), involving establishment of 16,000 ha of new woodlands; and (iii) Biomass Strategy (BS), involving conversion of 65,513 ha of arable land into bioenergy crops. It was assumed that each of these targets would be implemented by the year 2020, with carbon build-up times of 100, 100 and 30 years, respectively. Estimates of C-stock changes were produced by compiling vegetation and soil organic C-density data for 11 land-use types from a systematic literature review. Results indicated that FS would lead to the highest yearly potential carbon sequestration (up to 3.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, the total C-stocks would be the highest under RB (up to 20% increase), owing to the greater area of pastures and arable land being converted into broadleaved forest when compared to FS. BS would have the least effect on C (C-stock increase of up to 0.3% and up to 0.41 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) sequestered). The spatially explicit analytical approach adopted here provides an indication of which land-use changes would contribute most to C-sequestration within the South West region, and could contribute to achieving national emission reduction targets post-2012.

AB  - Aims Soil fungal communities play a critical role in ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.

AB  - Glomalin, an arbuscular mycorrhizal protein component of soil, can be used as an indicator of terrigenous-derived carbon. We measured glomalin in sediments using the terrestrial end-member as a reference in four coastal settings: (1) intertidal seagrass meadows distributed over a rainfall gradient, (2) sediments inshore and offshore from the mouth of a river, (3) coastal coral reefs at various distances from the shore, and (4) intertidal wetlands with varying levels of groundwater influence. Across the rainfall gradient, glomalin in seagrass meadow sediments increased at sites with high mean annual rainfall during the wet season (r(2) = 0.27; F-1,F-29 = 5.75; p = 0.029). Glomalin decreased in inshore river sediments (terrestrial) to offshore (marine) sediments (r(2) = 0.81; F-1,F-17 = 71.7; p <= 0.0001). Furthermore, glomalin in reef sediments decreased with distance from the shore. The high intertidal was rich in glomalin where groundwater flowed directly into the wetland compared with those with little groundwater influences. Our data indicate that rivers and groundwater transport terrestrial material, and that mangroves, salt marsh, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs accumulate it, but the connections vary among sites, within sites, and seasonally. Variations in glomalin concentrations are indicative of links between the terrestrial and marine environment that reflect proximity, filtration services, and the level of subsidies that marine ecosystems derive from terrestrial sources. Assessment of glomalin contributes to evaluating terrestrial-marine connectivity, and thus provides knowledge to improve catchment management for the protection of marine ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands sequester large amounts of carbon in their soils, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and acting as a carbon sink. In this paper, we estimate the economic value of carbon sequestered by wetlands in the Delaware Estuary. We estimate the value of the current stock of wetlands, the value of the historic loss of wetlands, and under a range of different scenarios the expected future loss. We use historical topographic maps and Land Cover inventories of the Delaware Estuary to measure the acreage of tidal wetlands in nine distinct time periods from 1778 to 2011. Using these data, we estimate an annual rate of wetland loss of 1.03 km(2). Coupling observed land cover change with exogenous factors including sea-level rise, population pressure, and channel dredging, we estimate changes in tidal wetland area under a range of futufe scenarios for our expected future economic loss estimates.

AB  - Results of a 12-yr study in an oligotrophic South Carolina salt marsh demonstrate that soil respiration increased by 795 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and that carbon inventories decreased in sediments fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus. Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic matter in the top 5 cm of sediment was 475 g C m(-2) lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1). It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates that the increase in soil respiration was largely due to an increase in primary production. Sediment respiration in laboratory incubations also demonstrated positive effects of nutrients. Thus, the results indicate that increased nutrient loading of oligotrophic wetlands can lead to an increased rate of sediment carbon turnover and a net loss of carbon from sediments.

AB  - Salt marshes are important hotspots of long-term belowground carbon (C) storage, where plant biomass and allochthonous C can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years. However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.

AB  - An integrated emergy and economic evaluation of a 7-step ecological engineering system (7-step EES) located in Jiangsu Province, China was carried out. This 7-step EES was constructed to fully utilize existing S. alterniflora production through a low waste, clean production process and to help control the expansion of this invasive grass. First, the above ground S. alterniflora biomass removed for invasion control is used as the feedstock for the extraction of a bio-mineral liquid and its encapsulation, both of which provide a health supplement to treat gout and angiocardiopathy patients. Next, the residues left after extraction are used as a medium for mushroom cultivation, and then for raising earthworms. Finally, the remaining residues become the main component of a microbe enriched organic fertilizer, which is then returned to the soil. A suite of emergy indices were constructed on multiple temporal and spatial scales to examine the operation of the whole system and its subsystems. The results showed that the temporal sustainability of the 7-step EES was relatively high at different spatial scales, especially at the local scale as indicated by its EISDB (1.55E+03). Full implementation of the 7-step EES for S. alterniflora currently residing on the coast of China can result in a potential economic output that is greater than 2% of the national GDP, with an economic output/input ratio over 29. In addition, the 7-step EES had an environmental loading ratio lower than that of the regional system. Sensitivity analysis showed that decreasing the cost of the purchased inputs needed to make the capsules is the key problem that needs to be solved to optimize the system, both for its sustainability and economic viability, on all spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (C-org) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4 +/- 0.3 kg C-org m(-2) in 1 m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8 +/- 1.7 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low C-org storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil C-org storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil C-org pool, fluxes of C-org from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store C-org in coastal areas.

AB  - Although empirical studies show that invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) has reduced soil bulk density (BD), the mechanisms that underpin this response are still unclear. To explore this pattern, we used a space-for-time substitution approach and collected soil samples from the eastern coast of China, where S. alterniflora ecosystems were established a short period of time after initial invasion. We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on BD through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes. The model showed that these processes explain 82% of the BD variation in response to S. alterniflora invasion. We observed that SOC had the most direct influence on BD, followed by salinity and soil sand content. We also found that S. alterniflora invasion had an important direct influence on the measured variables. Although plant productivity was not directly related to BD, it was indirectly associated with the impacts of plant productivity on salinity. Our results highlight the occurrence of BD variability within an interacting system of soil and plants wherein S. alterniflora invasion leads to a decrease in BD. This work also highlights that identifying the mechanisms driving BD variability in response to S. alterniflora invasion would help to improve our understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.

AB  - Dynamics of reclaimed coastal wetland soils under cultivation has not been well understood, especially at temporal scales longer than a century. In this study, we analyzed major chemical properties of plow-layer soils extensively sampled under two cropping systems (paddy rice vs. upland cropping) along a 500-year soil chronosequence created by intermittent reclamation of coastal salt marshes. The results suggested a rapid desalinization of soil immediately after reclamation. During 500 years of cultivation, the decalcification process lowered soil pH from >8 to nearly neutral. Soil organic carbon (SOC) contents markedly declined in the initial 16 years, but then rapidly recovered within 30 years and thereafter slowly accumulated with cultivation duration. Meanwhile, the recalcitrance of SOC increased. Soil nutrient status was enhanced after centuries of cultivation as indicated by the improved total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorous (TP). Amorphous Fe oxyhydrates progressively decreased, but the crystallinity of Fe oxyhydrates increased with cultivation time. Cropping system greatly affected plow-layer soil properties, with paddy soils having higher SOC. MBC, NH4OAc-extractable Ca2+, but lower TP, NH4OAc-extractable K, potentially mineralizable nitrogen and Fe crystallinity than upland soils. Most soil properties revealed clear temporal patterns with more remarkable changes occurring in the first several decades after reclamation than in the following centuries. In conclusion, there was a transition phase of the soil system within the first several decades after reclamation of coastal wetlands, possibly harmful to agricultural production, but centuries of cultivation seemed to have significantly improved overall soil fertility.

AB  - Purpose It is still controversial which type of plant litter is conducive to soil organic carbon (SOC) formation. Here we are to explore the conversion of organic carbon (OC) from decayed plant litter in soil and its influence on final SOC sequestration. Materials and methods In situ investigation combined with laboratory soil incubation experiments were conducted in mixing zones dominated by halophytes of Phragmites communis and Spartina alterniflora in the Jiuduansha wetland of the Yangtze River estuary to investigate differences in conversion patterns of OC from two decayed plant litters of different characteristics using traditional physicochemical indicators and stable isotope tracing. Additionally, the mechanism of biotransformation was investigated through analysis of soil microbial community structure. Results and discussion Due to the higher content of lignin and cellulose in P. communis litter, the associated soil microbial community was more conducive to the formation of soil humus (HS). By contrast, more easily decomposable S. alterniflora litter induced its related soil microbial community more amenable to mineralization. Consequently, OC from decayed S. alterniflora litter remained in soil for less time than that from decayed P. communis, and the lost OC was more readily converted into CO2. OC from decayed P. communis was degraded very slowly during the early stage of conversion (November), and its longer duration in soil was favorable for HS formation. Conclusions Analysis of the conversion of intermediates derived from different types of decayed plants can provide insight into plant litter input and SOC formation, and indicate the whereabouts of lost OC. From the perspective of plant biomass and conversion of plant litter-derived OC, P. communis is more conducive to soil carbon sequestration than S. alterniflora.

AB  - Although numerous studies have demonstrated that grazing significantly affects soil nutrients, plant biomass and soil microbial activities in grassland ecosystem, the responses of the relationships of soil nutrients with plant biomass and soil microbial activities to grazing intensities at a large scale are still unknown. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis across China's grasslands to address these questions. Our results suggested that different grazing intensities (low grazing (LG), medium grazing (MG) and high grazing (HG)) were closely related to plant biomass, soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial and enzyme activities. Specifically, MG significantly increased below-ground biomass (BGB). HG apparently decreased soil microbial activities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while LG showed the opposite results. The grazing-induced changes in plant biomass, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen might be the main underlying drivers that control the responses of SOC and TN to grazing intensities. The findings highlighted that LG was suitable for the sustainable development of China's grasslands and even worldwide dryland management.

AB  - Wetland restoration and creation efforts have been widely attempted as a way to compensate for wetland losses and to recover wetland functions; however, to date, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content recovery at a regional scale. This meta-analysis synthesizes 48 articles to identify the general patterns of soil C and N change after wetland restoration and creation in the United States. Our results indicate that, after 11-20 years, soil C and N in restored and created wetlands are still significantly lower by 51.7% and 50.3%, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C and N in restored wetlands recovered faster than in created wetlands. Furthermore, the soil C in restored organic flat and created depressional wetlands recovered more rapidly than in restored and created hydrologically open wetlands (riverine and tidal), respectively. Mean annual temperature and soil texture were recognized as two crucial abiotic factors affecting soil C and N recovery. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between the restoration and creation effect sizes on soil C and N, indicating that wetlands may alleviate N limitations intrinsically during C recovery processes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are critical in the global carbon budget while vulnerable to plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a typical invasive plant species, has rapidly expanded in China's coastal area since 1979, which disturbed the carbon cycle of the coastal wetland ecosystems. However, until now, the effect and underlying mechanisms of S. alterniflora invasion on methanotrophs are poorly known in coastal wetlands. Here, a largescale investigation of the activity, abundance and community structure of methanotrophs was conducted in seven wetlands under both native (dominated by Phragmites australis, Kandelia candel or Avicennia marina) and invasive plants (dominated by S. alterniflora) across the southeast coast of China. Compared with the native community, S. alterniflora invasion led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in activity and abundance of methanotrophs, which increased by 62.1% and 64.0% in average, respectively. The invasion of S. alterniflora did not greatly alter the methanotrophic community structure in most of the examined wetlands. However, the relative abundance of type I methanotrophs decreased under P. australis community, while type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis) increased after S. alterniflora invasion. In addition, the soil organic carbon content, ammonium content and salinity were identified as important environmental factors affecting the activity and community structure of methanotrophs. Overall, our results demonstrated that the activity and abundance of methanotrophs responded positively to S. alterniflora invasion, suggesting the important role of methanotrophs in reducing methane emissions from China's coastal wetlands.

AB  - This study is focused on determining the response behaviour of five saline plant communities to two environmental variables: flooding and salinity. Also, total soil organic carbon, diversity, plant cover and vegetation height were measured. Once this behaviour is known, the impacts of future climate scenarios may be approached. Since some of these variables could be altered by climate change, the future vegetation dynamics might indicate the trending of change, so plant communities can be used as bioindicators. The investigation was carried out in some small coastal wetlands located in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Low values of diversity were found in these plant communities due to a great effect of flooding, followed by salinity. 'Reed beds' are bioindicators of flooding and environmental disturbance. 'Saline rushes' are also flooding bioindicators and efficient accumulators of organic matter. 'Mediterranean halophilous scrubs' are bioindicators of seasonal flooding and changes to salinity. 'Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous scrubs' might be considered as bioindicators of low flooding and low salinity in anthropic environment while 'Mediterranean salt steppes' bioindicate driest conditions. At present, Mediterranean halophilous scrubs are the most widely extended community, which could be interpreted as a consequence of a changing and sharply seasonal climate. Our research suggests that future climate change scenarios involving flooding increases would support the proliferation of the lowest diversity and thus lower ecological value plant communities (i.e. reed beds). Conversely, a future scenario of decreasing flooding would benefit the most diverse and valuable conservation community actually priortized by European Habitats Directive (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia).

AB  - Sea level rise alters coastal carbon cycling by driving the rapid migration of coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater systems, and replacement of terrestrial forests with tidal wetlands. Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.

However, the capacity for wetlands to serve as more permanent C and N sinks over the long term is less clear given the time dependence of sediment deposition, organic matter decomposition, and anthropogenic land use change. In this study, we compare the short-term (decadal scale) and long-term (millennial scale) C and N accumulation rates estimated using Cs-137 and radiocarbon dating of vibracores collected from a freshwater coastal wetland in the Louisiana Mississippi River deltaic plain (Atchafalaya River delta). The mean short-term (60 yrs) sediment accumulation rate was 1.4 cm/yr while the mean rate of long-term (100-1000 yrs) sediment accumulation was an order of magnitude lower at 0.12 cm/yr. Annual rates of C and N accumulated over the past several thousand years were approximately 10% of that over the past 60 years after correcting for bulk density. These results are similar to other coastal wetlands and suggest that time scale must be considered in determining the relative permanence of C and N storage in coastal wetland soils. This difference is especially important for assessing the role of C cycling in relation to global change models and N cycling related to water quality in accurately quantifying the role of coastal deltaic fresh water wetlands in regulating these biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - With immense impact on coastal ecosystems' function, especially on nutrient cycle, Spartina alterniflora has become the most importantly invasive species in coastal wetland of China. However, the alternation of sulfur level and transformation between different inorganic sulfur (IS) fractions caused by the plant are poorly understood. In order to study the effect of S. alterniflora invasion and growth on soil IS components, we used space for-time substitution method and examined a whole year dynamics of different sulfur components in 0-60 cm soil of S. alterniflora tidal flat and mudflat at Jiaozhou Bay. Results indicated S. alterniflora improved soil sulfur level and its bio-availability, increased the contents of soil TS, total inorganic sulfur (TIS) and all of the IS fractions except hydrochloric acid volatile sulfur (HVS). But only the rate of soil adsorbed sulfur (AS) to TIS raised following invasion. In addition, S. alterniflora elevated the accumulation sites of soil Hydrochloric acid soluble sulfur (HSS) and HVS from deep soil to rhizosphere in spring. Key impact factors on IS fractions altered as invasion from soil physicochemical factors to plant fctors. Further, S. alterniflora encouraged the transformation of sulfur state from precipitation (HSS, HVS) to dissolved (HS, AS). This implies that the plant induced to an elevation of sulfur provided capacity and a reduction of sulfur toxicity in soil, which has vitally ecological significance for its expansion in costal wetlands. Now, S. alterniflora has occupied large area mudflat and was competing for habitat with native species in Jiaozhou Bay.

AB  - In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel created an inlet over 500 m wide and 10 m deep that connected the Atlantic Ocean and Pamlico Sound. This breach was subsequently filled with sediments dredged from the adjacent sound. The purpose of this study was to determine if the barrier island terrestrial plant communities were naturally re-establishing through primary succession. In 2006-2008, we compared plant communities, soil carbon and nitrogen, and Aeolian transport of sediments in undisturbed back-dunes, undisturbed shrub thickets, putative back-dunes, and putative shrub thickets. We found that species richness and evenness were low on the filled area relative to adjacent plant communities that had persisted through the storm. Plants on the filled area were almost entirely limited to a band of primarily Spartina patens found at the margin of the sound and there were no signs of establishing the typical zonation of back dune grasses, shrubs, and salt marsh. Evaluation of soil quality suggests that nutrients and organic material are not limiting recovery. Aeolian transport, however, was demonstrably higher across the filled area, where no dense stands of taller plants buffered the airflow. Plant re-establishment is suppressed by wind erosion inhibiting deposition of seeds. Recovery of the site will likely depend on the rhizomatous spread of S. patens from the sound shore. S. patens can then potentially facilitate the colonization of other species by buffering the wind and trapping seeds of other plants. Ironically, this slow recovery may benefit federally threatened bird species that require sparse vegetation for nesting success.

AB  - Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mitigation of increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by plants may be more efficient in saline systems with soils lower in organic matter than in other freshwater systems. In saline systems, decomposition rates may be lower and potential soil carbon storage higher than in fresh water systems. The effects of salinity, plant species and time on CO2 surface flux and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) leached during irrigation were determined in the laboratory in microcosms containing sand amended with residues of two halophytes, Atriplex nummularia and Salicornia bigelovii, and one glycophyte, Triticum aestivum. Surface flux of CO2 and DOC leached during decomposition were monitored for 133 days at 24 degrees C in microcosms containing different plant residue (5% w/w). Microcosms were irrigated every 14 days with distilled water or seawater adjusted to 10, 20, or 40 g L(-1) salts. CO2 flux and DOC leached were significantly higher from microcosms amended with A. nummularia residue compared to S. bigelovii or T. aestivum at all salinities and decreased significantly over time for all plant species. Irrigating with water of high salinity, 40 g L(-1), compared to distilled water resulted in a decrease in CO2 surface Aux and DOC in leachate, but differences were not significant at all sampling dates. Results indicate that plant residue composition, as well as increased salinity, affect CO2 surface flux and DOC in leachate during plant residue decomposition and may be an important consideration for C storage in saline systems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as "Blue Carbon"), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.

AB  - Changes in the sources and sinks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in wetland soils as indicators of soil quality and climate change have received attention worldwide. Soil samples were collected in 2007 and 2012 in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta and the SOC and TN were determined to investigate a five-year change in their content and stock in these wetlands as affected by flow-sediment regulation. Our results revealed that the soils in 2007 exhibited greater electrical conductivities, SOC content and density, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) levels in the top 10 cm soils (p < 0.05) compared with the soils in 2012. In general, the SOC and TN contents decreased with increasing soil depth. However, the highest ratios of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (molar C/N ratios) were observed in the 30-40 cm soil layer. A significant SOC loss occurred (p < 0.05) in top 10 cm soils, but only a small change in SOC in the top 50 cm soils. Comparatively, TN levels did not show significant differences in the study period.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are an ecological engineering technology that has been widely applied to treat anthropogenic wastewater. Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis. Furthermore, the constructed wetlands accumulated soil RP-C from 2.33 to 0.08 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the constructed wetlands 1 to 30 years old, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Knowledge of root: shoot ratio (R/S) is fundamental for our understanding of carbon allocation and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the periodic variation of water table and the difficulty ofmeasuring belowground biomass (BGB), macrophyte biomass allocation in both coastal and inland wetlands remains unclear, especially at regional scale. In this study, 131 records of biomass allocation inwetlandswere collected to examine general pattern of macrophyte R/S in relation to climate, soil, and hydrological factors in China using model selection and variance decomposition analysis. Our results showed that coastal wetlands supported higher aboveground biomass (AGB, 3.1 kgm(-2)) but a lower R/S (1.2) than inland ones (1.47 kgm(-2) and 3.1, respectively). The positive relationships between AGB and BGB and between BGB and R/S in coastal wetlands were significantly different from those in inland wetlands, while only inland wetlands exhibited a significant negative correlation between R/S and AGB (R-2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Among climate ( i.e., mean annual temperature and precipitation), soil (e.g., pH, salinity, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), and hydrological (water level and depth for coastal and inland wetlands, respectively) properties, the latter two groups explained 64% and 31% of spatial variation for inland and coastal R/S, respectively, compared with climate (2.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Specifically, soil salinity was the most important factor in regulating R/S for coastal wetlands, while, for inlandwetlands, itwas soil phosphorus. This study highlights the importance of hydrology, soil salinity and nutrients on wetland R/S and BGB estimation, which could be incorporated into wetland ecosystem models to improve prediction performance for carbon dynamics and their feedbacks to climate change in the future.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, and lots of them are invaded by Spartina alterniflora across different climate zones. We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms. Our results are helpful to better understand the mechanisms involved in the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on GHG emissions in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Changes in the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in arctic soils may influence the global carbon cycle and be an important feedback mechanism to global climate changes. In order to estimate the carbon stock and accumulation rates at Flakkerhuk on Disko Island in West Greenland, an 1800-ha study area was divided into land cover types using a satellite image. Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh. The study shows the importance of landscape history and age when sampling and evaluating SOC stocks and provides estimates of arctic soil C accumulation rates during Holocene versus present rates.

AB  - Methane production by methanogens in wetland is recognized as a significant contributor to global warming. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), which is an invasion plant in China's wetland, was reported to have enormous effects on methane production. But studies on shifts in the methanogen community in response to S. alterniflora invasion at temporal and spatial scales in the initial invasion years are rare. Sediments derived from the invasive species S. alterniflora and the native species Phragmites australis (P. australis) in pairwise sites and an invasion chronosequence patch (4 years) were analyzed to investigate the abundance and community structure of methanogens using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) cloning of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) gene. For the pairwise sites, the abundance of methanogens in S. alterniflora soils was lower than that of P. australis soils. For the chronosequence patch, the abundance and diversity of methanogens was highest in the soil subjected to two years invasion, in which we detected some rare groups including Methanocellales and Methanococcales. These results indicated a priming effect at the initial invasion stages of S. alterniflora for microorganisms in the soil, which was also supported by the diverse root exudates. The shifts of methanogen communities after S. alterniflora invasion were due to changes in pH, salinity and sulfate. The results indicate that root exudates from S. alterniflora have a priming effect on methanogens in the initial years after invasion, and the predominate methylotrophic groups (Methanosarcinales) may adapt to the availability of diverse substrates and reflects the potential for high methane production after invasion by S. alterniflora.

AB  - The stable soil carbon (C) pool in coastal wetlands, referred to as "blue C", which has been extensively damaged by climate change and soil degradation, is of importance to maintain global C cycle. Therefore, to investigate the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration rate and evaluate C budgets in coastal wetlands are urgently. In this study, the diurnal and seasonal variation of soil respiration rate in the reed wetland land (RL) and the bare wetland land (BL) was measured in situ with the dynamic gas-infrared CO2 method in four seasons, and the factors impacted on the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration were investigated. The results showed that the diurnal variation of soil respiration rate consistently presented a "U" curve pattern in April, July, and September, with the maximum values at 12: 00 a.m. and the minimum values at 6: 00 a.m. In the same season, the diurnal soil respiration rate in RL was significantly greater than those in BL (P < 0.05). In April, July, and September, the mean diurnal soil respiration rate was 0.14, 0.42, and 0.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in RL, 0.05, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.01 mmol m(-2) s(-1) in BL, respectively. Soil surface temperature was the primary factor that influenced soil respiration, which was confirmed by the exponential positive correlation between the soil respiration rate and soil surface temperature in BL and RL (P < 0.05). In addition, the high salinity of soils suppressed soil respiration, confirming by the significantly negative correlation between soil respiration rate and the content of soluble salt. These results will be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying soil respiration and elevating C sequestration potential in the coastal wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora in coastal areas of China increased methane (CH4) emissions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we measured CH4 production potential, methanogen community structure and biogeochemical factors along a coastal wetland transect comprised of five habitat regions: open water, bare tidal flat, invasive S. alterniflora marsh and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis marshes. CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively. S. alterniflora invasion elevated concentration of non-competitive trimethylamine, and shifted methanogen community from acetotrophic to facultative methanogens, which together facilitated increased CH4 production potential.

AB  - Coastal reclamation seriously disturbs coastal wetland ecosystems, while its influences on soil microbial communities remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition. These changes were driven primarily by variations in soil nutrient substrates and physiochemical properties. Changes in soil microbial communities following coastal reclamation impacted the decomposition and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, with potential modification of carbon and nitrogen sinks in the ecosystems, with potential feedbacks in response to climate change.

AB  - In tidal marshes, spatial and temporal variability in the importance of microbial metabolic pathways influences ecosystem-level processes such as soil carbon storage, the regeneration of inorganic nutrients, and the production of atmospherically important trace gases. We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron-sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plantmediated processes. In midsummer, Fe(III) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe(III) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils. Our data suggested that variations in microbial metabolic pathways were regulated by physiochemical factors at the brackish site and plant activity at the freshwater site. Plant regulation of Fe(III) reduction is a largely unstudied mechanism by which plants influence wetland carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.

AB  - This study sought to investigate the influence of different land types on soil enzyme activities and identify the driving factors behind it. Three prevalent land cover types and one land use type by Qinghai Lake were selected (original wetland, natural grassland, recovered shrubland, and farmland), and the surface soil at a depth of 0-10cm was collected for analysis. The results indicated that soil organic carbon, active carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen content, microbial biomass, and soil hydrolase activity decreased, whereas phenol oxidase activity increased after converting the wetland into other land types. However, the differences in microbial biomass and enzyme activities between farmland and recovered shrubland were not significant. Similar trends in -glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were detected and these were more sensitive to the changes in land types. Soil carbon and nitrogen contents were shown to be responsible for the variability in hydrolase activity, with active carbon showing the strongest influence. Wetland conversion induces the loss of soil carbon and nitrogen stock, which may further decrease the availability of organic matter for microbes. A decrease in hydrolase activity and an increase in phenol oxidase activity may indicate shifts in organic carbon bioavailability after wetland conversion.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, among the most productive ecosystems, are important global reservoirs of carbon (C). Accelerated sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands increase salinity and inundation depth, causing uncertain effects on plant and soil processes that drive C storage. We exposed peat-soil monoliths with sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) plants from a brackish marsh to continuous treatments of salinity (elevated (similar to 20ppt) vs. ambient (similar to 10ppt)) and inundation levels (submerged (water above soil surface) vs. exposed (water level 4cm below soil surface)) for 18months. We quantified changes in soil biogeochemistry, plant productivity, and whole-ecosystem C flux (gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; ecosystem respiration, ER). Elevated salinity had no effect on soil CO2 and CH4 efflux, but it reduced ER and GEP by 42 and 72%, respectively. Control monoliths exposed to ambient salinity had greater net ecosystem productivity (NEP), storing up to nine times more C than plants and soils exposed to elevated salinity. Submersion suppressed soil CO2 efflux but had no effect on NEP. Decreased plant productivity and soil organic C inputs with saltwater intrusion are likely mechanisms of net declines in soil C storage, which may affect the ability of coastal peat marshes to adapt to rising seas.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly studying carbon (C) storage by natural ecosystems for climate mitigation, including coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems. Unfortunately, little guidance on how to achieve robust, cost-effective estimates of blue C stocks to inform inventories exists. We use existing data (492 cores) to develop recommendations on the sampling effort required to achieve robust estimates of blue C. Using a broad-scale, spatially explicit dataset from Victoria, Australia, we applied multiple spatial methods to provide guidelines for reducing variability in estimates of soil C stocks over large F. areas. With a separate dataset collected across Australia, we evaluated how many samples are needed to capture variability within soil cores and the best methods for extrapolating C to 1 m soil depth. We found that 40 core samples are optimal for capturing C variance across 1000's of kilometres but higher density sampling is required across finer scales (100-200 km). Accounting for environmental variation can further decrease required sampling. The within core analyses showed that nine samples within a core capture the majority of the variability and log-linear equations can accurately extrapolate C. These recommendations can help develop standardized methods for sampling programmes to quantify soil C stocks at national scales.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems store large quantities of organic carbon for long periods of time. This study explores organic carbon stock change through the first comparative study of radiometric analysis and repeat field measures over a multi-decadal period in a mangrove system. Examining one tall gallery forest of Avicennia marina, and an adjacent interior scrub mangrove of mixed Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum, radiometric analysis estimated a soil organic carbon accumulation rate of 4.3 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall gallery forest and 2.2 +/- 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in a stunted mangrove. Repeat measures of root carbon separated by 30 years estimated an increase of 5.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall forest and 6.63 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the stunted forest-suggesting an underestimate of carbon accumulation by radiometric dating of 15% and 67% in the tall and stunted forest, respectively. A higher carbon stock in the interior forest was attributed to root mass increase, associated with landward mangrove encroachment. Extrapolated to the entire region of NSW we estimate that mangrove encroachment has contributed at least about 1.8 Tg C sequestration over the 70 years for which this has been observed in New South Wales, Australia.

AB  - Plant invasion can affect nutrient cycling by changing the quantity and quality of litter entering the environment. To determine the effect of an alien species (Spartina alterniflora) invasion on the decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics of litter in the Min River estuary, three communities with differing levels of invasion, namely, a Cyperus malaccensis community (before invasion, BI stage), a S. alterniflora community (after invasion, AI stage), and a C. malaccensis-S. alterniflora community (during invasion, DI stage), were studied using the space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79% faster than that of S. alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the C/N and lignin. Compared with S. alterniflora, the N (nitrogen) and S (sulfur) concentrations of litter in C. malaccensis were significantly higher. The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage. In summary, the invasion of S. alterniflora reduces the decomposition rate and nutrient release of litter.

AB  - This paper reports findings about the growth of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.) near an engineered coastal protection defences to discover the potential influences on vegetation growth from the artificial topography. Impacts of the artificial topography on the sediment element composition were detected by comparing the fixed effects caused by artificial topography and wave exposure using linear mixed models. Surficial sediments under the impacts of artificial topography contain elevated levels of biogenic elements and heavy metals, including C (and organic carbon), N, S, Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb. The results showed that element enrichment caused by artificial topography reduced the vegetation sexual reproduction. Contrary to the potential inhibition caused by direct wave exposure, which was due to the biomass accumulation limit, the inhibition caused by artificial topography was related to the transition of growth strategy. The contents of Cu, Mn, N, Ni, S and As in the sediments were critical in considering the relationship between the change in the sediment element composition and the alteration in the plant growth. Our study emphasizes the importance of rethinking the impacts of coastal development projects, especially regarding the heterogeneity of sediment element composition and its ecological consequences.

AB  - Biological invasion has profoundly influenced coastal soil reservoirs of carbon. Previous carbon studies regarding biological invasion in coastal wetlands mainly focused on soil organic carbon; however, little is known about the mechanisms that control soil inorganic carbon (SIC, e.g., carbonates) variation. In order to explore our understanding, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate controlling mechanisms of SIC in response to Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) invasion in the east-central China coast, where there is a lack of native salt marsh species. A space-for-time substitution method was used to identify sampling sites, assuming it has the capability to quantify the soil-vegetation relationship along a gradient of the increasing S. alterniflora age (17 year). The results showed that soil inorganic carbon density (SICD) at the 0.3-0.6 m depth exhibited a decline under S. alterniflora invasion, while there was no substantial change at the depths of 0-0.3 m and 0.6-1 m. The majority of the variances in SICD changes could be explained by S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables. In SEM, S. alterniflora invasion, soil water content, and soil texture presented direct influence on SICD throughout the soil profile (i.e., to 1 m depth). Soil salinity presented direct influence on SICD in the upper 0.6 m soil, while pH played an important role in the depth of 0.6-1 m. These results highlight that dynamics of SIC processes are probably controlled by interactions among S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables.

AB  - Coastal habitats are important and imperiled. To mitigate climate change impacts, carbon (C) sequestration has joined established restoration objectives, including habitat diversity, public access, and native vegetation. Changing topography, maintaining trails, and removing invasive plants may influence coastal C production and retention in different ways depending on how each activity influences the stabilization of organic matter in surface sediments. We quantified variation in litter and surface soil dynamics within and between coastal parks that varied in age from prerestoration to nearly 20 years old in Manatee County, Florida. Older parks had deeper soil organic horizons with higher levels of soil moisture and respiration, indicating that restoration sequesters soil C despite increases in microbial efficiency. However, variation within parks indicated that detrital C dynamics change depending on local management objectives. Relative to unmanaged locations, restored wetlands, including mangroves, salt marshes, and freshwater ponds, had soil organic horizons nearly 20 cm deeper, with high litter stabilization rates despite less litter mass and shorter projected soil sample C mineralization. In contrast, public access features like trails and kayak launches were associated with increased surface CO2 efflux and marginally reduced soil organic horizon depth. Removing invasives had little impact on detrital carbon pools and fluxes. Incorporating detrital C dynamics improved a multivariate model for variation in C pool sizes across sites. Overall, our results suggest that management objectives influence the C production and retention capacity of restored coastal habitats with restored uplands and public access points storing less C than relatively inaccessible wetlands.

Generally, average contents of SOC and TN were higher at tidal flooding Guangrao wetland (GRA) than those at Changyi (CY) wetland where the tidal can rarely reached. Among the five profiles, higher variations of SOC and TN were observed in CYB1 and CYB2, where the TP contents showed lower variations. SOC showed a rapid decrease with depth in CYB1 and CYB2, whereas they tended to increase with depth in GRA1 and GRA2. Vertical distributions of TN were significantly correlated with SOC in profile GRA1, CYB1, and CYB2. However, no clear trend was found on the vertical variations of TP. Additionally, C, N, and P ecological stoichiometry in these two coastal wetlands had high complexities within wetland. The C/N ratios were generally higher, while the C/P ratios and the N/P ratios were comparatively low, indicating the coastal wetland biogeochemical processes were more limited by N and P, with the former may being the primary factor. Our results also indicated that both vegetation coverage and tidal flooding were important in the biogeochemical processes of these coastal wetlands.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have been identified as vital global carbon (C) sinks; however, soil C sequestration in these ecosystems is susceptible to impacts of non-native species invasion and climate change worldwide. Although their potential impacts on soil organic C (SOC) storage have been reported in previous literature, the well-established mechanisms that control SOC storage response, especially in relation to soil depths, is still limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a structural equation model (SEM) to identify mechanisms that account for SOC changes in topsoil (0-03 m) and subsoil (0.3-0.6 m) on coastal wetland of the East China Sea, where SOC in both depths increased with exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion. In the initial model, we hypothesized that there were a set of direct and indirect effects of the invasion, climate, and soil physicochemical properties on SOC storage. By evaluating the interactions of these factors, we found relatively complex patterns that vary with depth. For topsoil, the invasion had not only direct effects on SOC storage, but also indirect effects through mediating effects of soil water content (SWC) that was linked to fine soil fractions. For subsoil, the invasion was indirectly related to SOC storage through mediating effects of SOC in topsoil, SWC, and salinity. SOC in subsoil was also affected by temperature. Our results highlight that the response of SOC storage to the invasion and climate change results from the interacting effects of climate-plant-soil system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soils were collected from low tidal flats and high tidal flats of Shang shoal located upstream and Xia shoal located downstream with different tidal water qualities, in the Jiuduansha wetland of the Yangtze River estuary. Soil respiration (SR) in situ and soil abiotic and microbial characteristics were studied to clarify the respective differences in the effects of tidal water salinity and nutrient levels on SR and soil carbon sequestration in low and high tidal flats. In low tidal flats, higher total nitrogen (TN) and lower salinity in the tidal water of Shang shoal resulted in higher TN and lower salinity in its soils compared with Xia shoal. These would benefit beta-Proteobacteria and Anaerolineae in Shang shoal soil, which might have higher heterotrophic microbial activities and thus soil microbial respiration and SR. In low tidal flats, where soil moisture was high and the major carbon input was active organic carbon from tidal water, increasing TN was a more important factor than salinity and obviously enhanced soil microbial heterotrophic activities, soil microbial respiration and SR. While, in high tidal flats, higher salinity in Xia shoal due to higher salinity in tidal water compared with Shang shoal benefited gamma-Proteobacteria which might enhance autotrophic microbial activity, and was detrimental to beta-Proteobacteria in Xia shoal soil. These might have led to lower soil microbial respiration and thus SR in Xia shoal compared with Shang shoal. In high tidal flats, where soil moisture was relatively lower and the major carbon input was plant biomass that was difficult to degrade, soil salinity was the major factor restraining microbial activities, soil microbial respiration and SR.

AB  - Coastal marshes are essential habitats for soil carbon accumulation and burial, which can influence the global carbon budget. Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr(-1), a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget.

AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation communities can respond to sea level rise via the encroachment of more salt- and inundation-tolerant species into existing vegetation communities. Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts. Increases in salinity and inundation were linked to mangrove encroachment.

AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from similar to 10,500 km(2) (1980s) to similar to 6700 km(2) (2010s), say similar to 1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached similar to 9700 km(2), including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (similar to 99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (similar to 31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as similar to 8 billion USD yr(-1) with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater influenced wetlands (FIW), wetlands impacted by both freshwater flooding and underground seawater (MIW) and seawater influenced wetlands (SIW) were chosen as sampling sites to investigate the variations in the soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that a salinity gradient developed as the hydrologic conditions ranged from freshwater to seawater. In 0-50cm soils, the mean values of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and readily oxidized organic carbon (ROOC) were higher in FIW and SIW than those in MIW, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a higher mean value in MIW. Along the 0-50cm soil profile, SOC, MBC, ROOC and DOC decreased as the soil depth increased in FIW and SIW. However, in MIW, soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later. The annual mean values of SOC in 0-50 cm soils were 6.87 g/kg in FIW, 4.92 g/kg in MIW and 5.42 g/kg in SIW, respectively. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) values for FIW, MIW and SIW were 4.55, 3.26 and 3.84 kg C/m(2), respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that SOC, ROOC and DOC were significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, bulk density (BD), sand content, and the C/N ratio, and positively related with water content (WC), silt content, and TN (p < 0.05). However, MBC showed a significantly negative relationship with EC, salt ions content, pH, BD and the C/N ratio, and a significantly positive correlation with TN (p < 0.05).

AB  - Plant invasion may impact ecosystem structure and function, and further affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition. The results suggest that 10-year S. alterniflora invasion significantly alters soil organic C and N pools sizes and stability through changing plant residuals input, physical distribution of S. alterniflora-derived C and C turnover in SOM fractions.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora has rapidly expanded in coastal wetlands of China, and this would affect soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and stability. In the present work, the impacts of S. alterniflora colonization on SOC pool and stability was deciphered to better understand how alien species altered the carbon cycle in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). SOC contents were in the range of 1.29 g/kg-7.02 g/kg, of which wetlands covered by S. alterniflora increased with colonization time and exceed those in wetlands covered by native species after 7 years. Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that aromatic moieties were predominant components of SOC, and there were remarkable increase trends of phenol and lignin compounds and decrease trend of aromatic moieties with S. alterniflora invasion time. SA had the highest microorganism biomass reflected by phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) across different wetlands. Salinity had the largest negative effects while nutrients had the largest positive effects on the SOC pool. The proportion of decomposition-resistant compounds (including aromatics, lignin, and phenol) to total SOC was decreasing while the SOC pool was increasing with S. alterniflora invasion time. This study demonstrated that S. alterniflora invasion could promote the SOC pool but weaken its stability in the wetlands of the YRD. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We experimentally increased salinities in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (Georgia, USA) by exposing the organic rich soils to 3.5 yr of continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments with dilute seawater to simulate the effects of climate change such as sea level rise (press) and drought (pulse). We quantified changes in root production and decomposition, soil elevation, and soil C stocks in replicated (n = 6) 2.5 x 2.5 m field plots. Elevated salinity had no effect on root decomposition, but it caused a significant reduction in root production and belowground biomass that is needed to build and maintain soil elevation capital. The lack of carbon inputs from root production resulted in reduced belowground biomass of 1631 +/- 308 vs. 2964 +/- 204 g/m(2)in control plots and an overall 2.8 +/- 0.9 cm decline in soil surface elevation in the press plots in the first 3.5 yr, whereas the control (no brackish water additions) and the fresh (river water only) treatments gained 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm, respectively, in a 3.5-yr period. There was no change in elevation of pulse plots after 3.5 yr. Based on measurements of bulk density and soil C, the decline of 2.8 cm of surface elevation resulted in a loss of 1.4 +/- 0.08 kg C/m(2)in press plots. In contrast, the control and the fresh treatment plots gained 0.7 +/- 0.05 and 0.8 +/- 0.05 kg C/m(2), respectively, which represents a net change in C storage of more than 2 kg C/m(2). We conclude that, when continuously exposed to saltwater intrusion, the tidal freshwater marsh's net primary productivity, especially root production, and not decomposition, are the main drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Reduced productivity leads to loss of soil elevation and soil C, which has important implications for tidal freshwater marsh persistence in the face of rising sea level.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora is an invasive C-4 perennial grass, native to North America, and has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

AB  - Lateral movements of materials and energy in coastal wetlands, due mainly to tidal activities, have been recognized as key processes in understanding the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems. However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.

AB  - Severely degraded wetlands due to the lack of freshwater were restored by reintroducing freshwater through the placement of artificial dikes and channels in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China. Many studies have evaluated the performances of this restoration projects in aspects of vegetation, soils, hydrology, wildlife, etc. In contrast, limited information was available on the effects of restoration projects on the soil microbial biomass and community composition. To better understand the wetland restoration, differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition between restored tidal wetlands and unrestored wetlands under the disturbance of petroleum exploitation activities or tidal intrusion were assessed. Surface soils (0-10 cm) under three different plant covers (Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa and bare land) were collected from each three wetland zones. Chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis were used to characterize soil microbial biomass and community composition. Our results showed significantly elevated microbial biomass in soils of the restoration zone, as indicated by both microbial biomass carbon and total PLFAs. Soil microbial community composition in the restoration zone also differed significantly from those in the petroleum exploitation zone and tidal zone. The freshwater input of restoration projects induced a soil microbial community shift to the increased relative abundance of fungi and decreased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio bacteria. The significantly promoted fungi in soils under P. australis of the restoration zone reflected the necessity of decomposers of the increased surface plant residues after restoration, which in turn contributed to the organic residues accumulation in soils and large aggregates formation by fungal hyphae. Meanwhile the modified soil carbon pool and aggregate structure following restoration of degraded wetland may favor the colonization of soil organisms. These results indicated that freshwater input had strongly altered soil microbial communities in the restored wetland, which may be of great significance in understanding the soil microbial responses to the restoration projects and the underlying mechanisms of wetland restoration.

AB  - The impacts of plant invasions are of great concern in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycling. However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasion by Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem along Chinese coast. Determining the main influential factors and their relationships with the distribution of S. alterniflora is thus crucial for invasion control. However, the distribution is influenced by environmental variables at different scales and the relative importance of cross-scale variables is unclear. Based on the MaxEnt modelling technique, a combined regional environmental niche (CREN) model was built by integrating the global climate niche (GCN) model into the regional environment niche (REN) model to study the combined effects of global climate suitability and regional environmental variables on species distribution. The CREN model performed much better than the GCN model with AUC, TSS, specificity and sensitivity values increasing by 0.12, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.45, whereas it performed as well as the REN model, but reduced the overfitting. When considering the combined effects, the predicted suitable area decreased from 66.90% at the global scale to 18.53% at the regional scale. Global sensitivity analysis showed there were strong interactions among different variables, especially for elevation and global climate suitability, the most influential variables. Interactions reduced the importance of soil salinity, but enhanced that of soil percentage sand. The presence probability increased with increasing of global climate suitability and soil salinity, while decreased with increasing of elevation, soil organic carbon and percentage sand. The presence probability was the highest in moderately well drained and lowest in poorly drained soil. Ignoring the combined effects of cross-scale variables will prevent comprehensive elucidation of their relationship with species distribution, which should be considered to take effective measures against biological invasion.

AB  - Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root: shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, (549) was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root: shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

AB  - Purpose To understand the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by Cyperus malaccensis (CM) and Spartina alterniflora (SA) in a typical subtropical estuary (Min River) of Southeast China, the concentrations of five metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni) in plants and sediments of CM and SA marshes were determined.
   Materials and methods Two experimental plots (no flooding plot and flooding plot) were established in the intertidal zone of the Min River estuary in July 2015, and, in each plot, in situ sampling was conducted in CM and SA marshes, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.
   Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.
   Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.

AB  - Recent empirical and theoretical approaches have called for an understanding of the processes underpinning ecosystem service provision. Environmental gradients have shown effects on key plant functional traits that subsequently explain ecosystem properties of several systems. However, little is known concerning how associations between plant functional traits, including both below- and aboveground plant components, predict ecosystem properties and independently measured final ecosystem services. Here, we modeled (1) the responses of the leaf and plant economics spectrum, Plant size axis, and root growth to environmental gradients and (2) how associations between plant functional traits explain trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem properties and final services. Forty-four plots were studied in a coastal marsh landscape of the German North Sea Coast. We used a partial least square structural equation model approach to test the hypothesized model. We found (1) a negative covariation between plant traits pertaining to a size axis and traits explaining both plant growth (roots and stems) and the leaf economics spectrum; (2) this trade-off responded significantly to the land use gradient and nutrient availability, which were both strongly driven by the groundwater gradient; (3) this trade-off explained an initial major trade-off between carbon stocks, at one extreme of the axis, and both the habitat value to conserve endangered plants and forage production for meat and dairy products at the other extreme. However, a secondary trade-off between nature conservation value and forage production, explained by a trade-off between leaf economics spectrum and plant growth in response to the land use intensity gradient, was also found.

AB  - Human-caused shifts in carbon (C) cycling and biotic exchange are defining characteristics of the Anthropocene. In marine systems, saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitats-collectively known as "blue carbon" and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)-are a leading sequester of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (+/- 16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.

AB  - This study applied the static chamber method to evaluate the CO2 fluxes from December 2013 to October 2014 in the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China. The study area was divided into Spartina alterniflora flat, Phragmites australis flat, Suaeda salsa flat and mud flat. Results showed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) presented obviously temporal and spatial variations during growing season, and slight fluctuation in non-growing season. Vegetated flats (S. alterniflora flat, P. australis flat and S. salsa flat) acted as CO2 sinks during growing season and CO2 sources during non-growing season; while mud flat acted as a CO2 sink through the entire period. Over the growing season, the estimated total NEE were -1202.83 g CO2 m(-2) in S. alterniflora flat, - 1129.16 g CO2 m(-2) in P. australis flat and -237.43 g CO2 m(-2) in S. salsa flat, respectively. Daytime NEE were significantly exponential related to light intensity in S. alterniflora flat and P. australis flat; whereas no overt exponential relationship was found between these two factors in S. salsa flat. In P. australis flat, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) in growing season were estimated to be 2874.05 and 1744.89 g CO2 m(-2), respectively; R-eco was significantly exponential related to air temperature and soil temperature at different depths, among which soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm was the most remarkable; temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco ranged from 2.72 to 3.67. Above ground biomass of P. australis over the entire growing season showed nonlinear relationships with NEE, GPP, and R-eco; while it showed significant linear relationships with these three factors during early and peak growing season. As for the mud flat acing as a CO2 sink, it is supposed to be caused by inorganic process, however the mechanism is not definite. Further research on the long-term and complete observations of CO2 exchange at the mud flat-atmosphere interface is necessary.

AB  - Microbial communities play key roles in remediation and reclamation of contaminated environments via biogeochemical cycling of organic and inorganic components. Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

AB  - Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000 km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in delta C-13 was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.

AB  - The highly visible coastal phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) was examined through the prism of carbon accumulation and loss. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestration in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes. Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon. These results may serve as a predictor of the impact of future predictions of increasing global sea level rise on carbon sequestration for other coastal regions.

AB  - Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with Pb-210-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 +/- 90 and -350 +/- 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) that accounted for similar to 13%-23% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a > 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 +/- 2.0 to 8 +/- 4 decades.

AB  - Groundwater tables and soil salinity can greatly affect the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen by altering soil physicochemical properties. Coastal wetlands with different plant cover types (including bare land, Phragmites australis, and Suaeda salsa wetlands) and groundwater table wetlands (including low groundwater table, medium groundwater table, and high groundwater table wetlands) were investigated in 2012-2013 to characterize the spatial and temporal changes and the effects of groundwater tables on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The results showed that SOCs in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 regardless of the groundwater tables, while TNs was higher in 2013 than in 2012 except in the BL soil with low groundwater tables and the PA wetlands with middle groundwater tables. The SOCc and TNc were mainly concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. SOC. and TNc were fitted very well with soil depth by the general linear fit (p < 0.01). The Lorentz models were ideal for the relationships among SOC, TN and electrical conductivity (EC), indicating that certain EC values could improve carbon and nitrogen accumulation. The theoretical threshold of EC for the maximum SOC and SOCs was 2.2 ms/cm, and the maximum TN and TNs highly depended on groundwater tables (0.9-1.0 ms/cm for LW, 1.6-1.8 ms/cm for MW and 3.0 ms/cm for HW). The general linear model results showed that SOC was positively correlated with TN at the same groundwater table (p < 0.01). Additionally, a positive linear relationship was also observed among SOC, TN and silt + clay contents for all groundwater tables (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that carbon and nitrogen stocks might be regulated by groundwater tables and salinity to improve carbon sinks in coastal wetlands.

AB  - The exotic species Spartina alterniflora has recently rapidly expanded in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve. As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) is an important pathway for gaseous carbon loss in coastal wetland environments. However, little is known regarding the dynamics of Rem and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) under different tidal stages, and vegetation types. In this study, R-eco was measured with dark chambers for nearly 2 years in three different brackish marsh stands dominated by Cyperus malaccensis, Phragmites australis, and Spartina alterniflora, respectively, in the Min River estuary of southeast China. The mean R-eco, across tidal stages and vegetation types exhibited strong temporal variations, and the Q(10) value for R-eco was higher in the warm months than in the cold months. The mean annual Reco was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity and soil water content, but positively correlated with both tidal water level and soil pH (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the seasonal variation in R-eco and Q(10) was largely driven by the thermal regimes and soil salinity. Also, we found that the mean Reco and Q(s10) value were both relatively higher when the site was exposed before tidal inundation, as compared to that after tidal inundation for all the vegetation types studied (P > 0.05). Overall, the C. malacensis and S. altemiflora stands had the highest and lowest average rates of Reco, respectively, while the mean Q(s10) values were lower in the Phragmites australis stand than the other two vegetation types. Our findings point to the need of strengthening the in situ measurements of gas fluxes at multiple time scales in order to develop a better understanding of the response of Reco to changing environmental conditions in the subtropical coastal wetlands. Our results also reiterate the importance of considering the influence of vegetation types in characterizing the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of Reco in estuarine tidal marshes for predicting ecosystem responses to future global change.

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The Spartina alterniflora invasion across the southeast coast in China significantly reduced vegetation diversity and generated associated ecological problems. Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora. Conclusion The S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased SOC and TN contents and reduced the abundance of sulfur-oxidizing functional genes, which led to the accumulation of soil sulfide.

AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an increasingly important role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus affecting climate change. However, the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of GHG fluxes in these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify patterns and drivers of GHG fluxes across coastal wetlands in China. Average methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were estimated as 2.20 +/- 0.31 mg.m(-2).h(-1), 16.44 +/- 2.96 mu g.m(-2).h(-1), and 388.76 +/- 42.28 mg.m(-2).h(-1), respectively. GHG emissions varied with tidal inundation, where CH4 and CO2 emissions during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. CH4 and CO2 emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude, while N2O did not. CH4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature and aboveground biomass, and CO2 emissions were positively related to soil organic carbon. N2O fluxes were lower with increasing soil pH, and CH4 and CO2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that the fluxes of CH4 and N2O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback to global warming, which is mainly driven by the CH4 emission. Our synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field observations of GHG fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in GHG fluxes and the assessment of net GHG balance and its contribution to the GWP of coastal wetlands.

AB  - The objective of this research was to compare and contrast C dynamics within plots occupied by Phragmites australis, Typha spp., and Sagittaria latifiolia in a Lake Erie coastal wetland (Ohio, USA). The effect of each species on above- and belowground biomass, soil C pools, soil labile C, litter decomposition rates, and microbial catabolic response profiles were analyzed. Phragmites australis and Typha spp. produced significantly more aboveground biomass (1,522 +/- 464 and 1,177 +/- 164 g DM m(-2), respectively) than S. latifolia (500 +/- 80 g DM m(-2)), although no difference was observed in terms of belowground biomass. After 208 days in the field, litter of S. latifolia had lost 72% of its initial mass while only 47% of the litter of Typha spp. and P. australis had decomposed. This coupled process of high primary production and slow litter decomposition within P. australis and Typha spp. communities did not translate into greater accumulation of C in the soil. In fact, we observed lower rates of C mineralization and greater biomass of methanogens in the S. latifolia plots. Despite similar water level, soil conditions in the S. latifolia community was more saturated, which might have limited availability of C for microbial consumption in these plots. Microbial catabolic responses to 24 substrates demonstrated distinct differences in the respiration responses of the soil microbial communities of the three macrophyte species. The microbial community found in the rhizosphere of P. australis was particularly responsive to phenolic acids. Few differences in C fluxes and pools were observed between plots occupied by P. australis and Typha spp., but the replacement of S. latifolia by one of the two other species could have a significant effect on the C cycle in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands.

AB  - To get further insights into the development of landscape elements and soils of North Sea barrier islands; an old part in the West (formed between approx. 1650-1860) and a young part, largely unaffected by anthropogenic influences in the East (formed approx. 1960), of the island Spiekeroog were comparatively analyzed. Between the two parts beach soils (World Reference Base of Soil Resources (WRB), IWG WRB (2015): Eutric Huvic Tiadalic and Eutric Endosalic Arenosols; German Soil Classification System (GSCS), AD-Hoc-AG BODEN (2005): Nassstrand and Strand) did not differ, except for microbial mats, which were found only in the East. In the West, a dune complex comprising white, gray and brown dunes holds a soil chronosequence from unaltered sands (WRB: Eutric Protic Arenosol; GSCS: Lockersyrosem) to braunified and podzolized soils (With: Dystric Brunk Arenosol; GSCS: Braunerde). However, in the East, only a single white dune chain, with adjacent shallow dune mounds to the south, had formed. In both parts, dune slacks evinced remarkably rapid peat formation (WRB: Dystric Histic and Eutric Histic Gleysols; GSCS: Niedermoorgleye). Here, iron content of groundwaters determined the formation of redoximorphic features. Soils of the salt marshes (WRB: Eutric Fluvic and Eutric Gleysols; GSCS: Rohmarschen) showed the highest contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the West, where the thickest fine sediment layers were also found. Revealed shortcomings of the German soil classification system concerning the classification of 'Strand' and 'Rohmarsch' soils are discussed. It is suggested to exclude the obligatory carbonate (CaCO3) content in the definition of the Strand soil and to introduce an additional horizon prefix to indicate carbonate contents between > 0 and < 2%, in order to classify Rohmarsch soils, with primary carbonate contents < 2%. Finally, an outlook on the future landscape -and soil development is provided, which is expected to be most profound in the young East.

AB  - Plant invasion has been reported to modify ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes and pools. The aims of this work were to identify the consequences of plant invasion on C and N dynamics in soil organic matter (SOM) and its fractions following invasion chronosequence. In this study, we investigated the soil C and N contents and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the SOM, free light fraction (LF), infra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) in invasive 6-, 10-, 17- and 20-year-old Spartina alterniflora communities and compared with bare flat land in a coastal wetland of eastern China. S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora. The decay rate of old C decreased and the mean residence time of C increased in SOM and its fractions following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The delta N-15 values of soil under S. alterniflora were more enriched than were those in bare flat land, whereas the delta N-15 values depleted following invasion chronosequence. Our results show that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered SOC dynamics following invasion chronosequence by changing C physical distribution in SOM, S. alterniflora-derived C input and C decomposition, ultimately having a greater impact on SOC incorporation relative to SON accumulation in a coastal wetland of eastern China.

AB  - Carbon (C) standing stocks, C mass balance, and soil C burial in tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) and TFFW transitioning to low-salinity marshes along the upper estuary are not typically included in blue carbon accounting, but may represent a significant C sink. Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.
   Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.

AB  - The exotic C-4 grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to tidal coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province of China in 1982. Since then it has rapidly replaced the native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa, becoming one of the dominant vegetation types in the coastal wetlands of China. Although plant invasion can change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, little is known about how plant invasion influences C storage within soil fractions. We investigated how S. altemiflora invasion across an 8, 12 and 14-year chronosequence affected SOC and soil nitrogen (N), using soil fractionation and stable delta C-13 isotope analyses. SOC and N concentrations at 0-10 cm depth in S. altemiflora soil increased during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence, ranging from 3.67 to 4.90 g C kg(-1) soil, and from 0.307 to 0.391 g N kg(-1) soil. These were significantly higher than the values in the Suaeda salsa community, by 27.0-69.6% for SOC. and 21.8-55.2% for total N. The S. alterniflora-derived SOC varied from 0.40 to 0.92 g C kg(-1) according to mixing calculations, assuming the two possible SOC sources of S. alterniflora and S. salsa, and accounted for 10.8-18.7% of total SOC in the colonized soils. The estimated accumulative rate of SOC from C-4 (S. alterniflora) was 64.1 C kg(-1) soil year(-1) and from C-3 sources was 78.1 mg C kg(-1). The concentration of S. alterniflora-derived SOC significantly decreased from coarse fraction to fine fraction, and linearly increased as the period of S. alterniflora invasion increased. The highest accumulative rate of SOC from a C-4 source occurred in macroaggregates, while the highest rate from C-3 was in microaggregates. The storage of SOC derived from S. alterniflora in the macroaggregates was 0.27-0.44 g C kg(-1) soil, accounting for 43.1-49.1% of the total C(4)derived SOC in the soil. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion in coastal wetlands could facilitate SOC storage, because of the high potential for accumulation of the C which has been newly derived from S. alterniflora litter and roots.

AB  - The increasing success of invasive plant species in wetland areas can threaten their capacity to store carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C, N, and P). Here, we have investigated the relationships between the different stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and total C, N, and P pools in the plant-soil system from eight different wetland areas across the South-East coast of China, where the invasive tallgrass Spartina alterniflora has replaced the native tall grasses Phragmites australis and the mangrove communities, originally dominated by the native species Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina. The invasive success of Spartina alterniflora replacing Phragmites australis did not greatly influence soil traits, biomass accumulation or plant-soil C and N storing capacity. However, the resulting higher ability to store P in both soil and standing plant biomass (approximately more than 70 and 15 kg P by ha, respectively) in the invasive than in the native tall grass communities suggesting the possibility of a decrease in the ecosystem N:P ratio with future consequences to below- and aboveground trophic chains. The results also showed that a future advance in the native mangrove replacement by Spartina alterniflora could constitute a serious environmental problem. This includes enrichment of sand in the soil, with the consequent loss of nutrient retention capacity, as well as a sharp decrease in the stocks of C (2.6 and 2.2 t C ha(-1) in soil and stand biomass, respectively), N, and P in the plant-soil system. This should be associated with a worsening of the water quality by aggravating potential eutrophication processes. Moreover, the loss of carbon and nutrient decreases the potential overall fertility of the system, strongly hampering the reestablishment of woody mangrove communities in the future.

AB  - A small body of research suggests that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can affect the carbon balance of peatlands, yet this has not been tested widely, despite the fact that peatlands contain approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Here we evaluate the role of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in a site that receives low atmospheric sulfur deposition. We hypothesized that, in peatlands receiving low sulfate inputs, methane production should dominate anaerobic carbon mineralization. We further hypothesized that with sulfate amendments, anaerobic carbon mineralization could show an overall increase if terminal carbon mineralization in unamended peat is limited by an inadequate supply of electron acceptors. To test these hypotheses, we delineated six 1-m(2) plots in an ombrotrophic, boreal peatland in central Alberta, Canada (Bleak Lake Bog), which receives <2 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1). Three of the plots were amended with sulfate (78 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1)). We measured anaerobic rates of sulfate reduction, CH4 production, and CO2 production. In opposition to our hypotheses, sulfate amendments did not increase rates of sulfate reduction, increase CO2 production, or decrease CH4 production over a 2-yr period, but did increase both sulfate pool sizes and residence times. Despite low rates of sulfate reduction compared to other freshwater wetlands, daily average sulfate reduction (1.7 mmol/m(2)) exceeded regional annual inputs of atmospheric sulfate deposition (1.6 mmol/m(2)). Between 77% and 99% of reduced sulfate was incorporated into the carbon-bonded sulfur pool, which turns over slowly. The slow turnover rate and comparatively low sulfate reduction rates may be related to the low iron content of the bog peat. Additionally, sulfate reduction initially was sulfate limited in the control plots, but with sulfur amendments, the sulfate limitation was removed; sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by some other factor, possibly labile carbon. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was more important to total anaerobic carbon mineralization than methane production, although neither process dominated overall anaerobic carbon mineralization (<2% of total). Fermentation appeared to be the dominant anaerobic carbon mineralization pathway at Bleak Lake Bog, yet the mechanisms of how this process affects the carbon balance of peatlands has never been evaluated. Overall, our results suggest that, in at least the short term, soil carbon turnover in peatlands will not be enhanced by increased atmospheric sulfur deposition. If we want to understand the controlling factors on soil carbon storage in sites like Bleak Lake Bog, we should begin to examine anaerobic carbon mineralization via fermentation pathways.

AB  - Wetlands play a crucial role in reducing global warming potential in response to global climate change. Largescale reclamation and artificial restoration of coastal wetlands significantly affect the greenhouse gas methane emissions of coastal ecosystems. To comprehensively understand the difference in methane emissions between natural and reclamation-restored wetlands, the natural bare mudflat (BM - bare mudflat) in Hangzhou Bay, three types of natural vegetation wetlands (SM - Scirpus mariqueter, PA - Phragmites australis, and SA - Spartina alterniflora), and four types of reclamation-restored P. australis wetlands with different water levels (RW0 - Water level at 0 cm; RW10 - Water level at 10 cm; RW20 - Water level at 20 cm; RW30 - Water level at 30 cm) were selected to analyze the relationship between methane emissions and environmental factors through field observations and laboratory experiments. The results showed that the methane emission flux and methane production potential (MPP) of reclamation-restored wetlands were notably higher than those of natural wetlands, and the monthly dynamics in the different types of wetlands were consistent with temperature. The methane emission flux increased rapidly from April to July (summer), and reached a monotonic peak in July. Among the natural wetlands, the methane emission flux and MPP of SA were significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the soil organic carbon (SOC). In the reclamation-restored wetlands, the methane emission fluxes did not significantly differ between RW10, RW20, and RW30, but were remarkably higher than those of RW0 and natural wetlands, which was mainly driven by the water level and salinity. The differences in the MPP of the different soil layers were mainly affected by the SOC and water levels. Especially in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer of the reclamation-restored wetlands, the MPP was significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the SOC. Therefore, during the later stages of artificial reclamation-restored wetlands, appropriate water level and salinity management and other effective engineering measures should be explored to manage methane emissions during wetland restoration.

AB  - Iron (III) plaque forms on the roots of wetland plants from the reaction of Fe(II) with O-2 released by roots. Recent laboratory studies have shown that Fe plaque is more rapidly reduced than non-rhizosphere Fe(III) oxides. The goals of the current study were to determine in situ rates of: (i) Fe(III) reduction of root plaque and soil Fe(III) oxides, (ii) root Fe(III) deposition, and (iii) root and soil organic matter decomposition. Iron (III) reduction was investigated using a novel buried-bag technique in which roots and soil were buried in heat-sealed membrane bags (Versapor 200 membrane, pore size = 0.2 mu m) in late fall following plant senescence. Bags were retrieved at monthly intervals for 1 yr to assess changes in total C and Fe mass, Fe mineralogy, Fe(II)[Fe(III) ratio, and the abundances of Fe(II)oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). The soil C and Fe pools did not change significantly throughout the year, but root C and total root Fe mass decreased by 40 and 70%, respectively. When total Fe losses were adjusted for changes in the ratio of Fe(II)[Fe(III), over 95% of the Fe(III) in the plaque was reduced during the 12-mo study, at a peak rate of 0.6 mg Fe(III) g dry weight(-1) d(-1) (gdw(-1) d(-1)). These estimates exceed the crude estimate of Fe(III) accumulation [0.3 mg Fe(III) g dry weight(-1) d(-1)] on bare-root plants that were transplanted into the wetland for a growing season. We concluded that root plaque has the potential to be reduced as rapidly as it is deposited under field conditions.

AB  - Tidal wetlands contain large reservoirs of carbon in their soils and can sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) at a greater rate per unit area than nearly any other ecosystem. The spatial distribution of this carbon influences climate and wetland policy. To assist with international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement, national-level assessments such as the United States (U.S.) National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and regional, state, local, and project-level evaluation of CO2 sequestration credits, we developed a geodatabase (CoBluCarb) and high-resolution maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution by linking National Wetlands Inventory data with the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database. For over 600,000 wetlands, the total carbon stock and organic carbon density was calculated at 5-cm vertical resolution from 0 to 300 cm of depth. Across the continental United States, there are 1,153-1,359 Tg of SOC in the upper 0-100 cm of soils across a total of 24945.9 km(2) of tidal wetland area, twice as much carbon as the most recent national estimate. Approximately 75% of this carbon was found in estuarine emergent wetlands with freshwater tidal wetlands holding about 19%. The greatest pool of SOC was found within the Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bay complex in Louisiana, containing about 10% of the U.S. total. The average density across all tidal wetlands was 0.071 g cm(-3) across 0-15 cm, 0.055 g cm(-3) across 0-100 cm, and 0.040 g cm(-3) at the 100 cm depth. There is inherent variability between and within individual wetlands; however, we conclude that it is possible to use standardized values at a range of 0-100 cm of the soil profile, to provide first-order quantification and to evaluate future changes in carbon stocks in response to environmental perturbations. This Tier 2-oriented carbon stock assessment provides a scientific method that can be copied by other nations in support of international requirements.

AB  - Whether plant invasion increases ecosystem carbon (C) stocks is controversial largely due to the lack of knowledge about differences in ecophysiological properties between invasive and native species. We conducted a field experiment in which we measured ecophysiological properties to explore the response of the ecosystem C stocks to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) in wetlands dominated by native Scirpus mariqueter (Scirpus) and Phragmites australis (Phragmites) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. We measured growing season length, leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), root biomass, net primary production (NPP), litter quality and litter decomposition, plant and soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks in ecosystems dominated by the three species. Our results showed that Spartina had a longer growing season, higher LAI, higher Pn, and greater root biomass than Scirpus and Phragmites. Net primary production (NPP) was 2.16 kg C m(-2) y(-1) in Spartina ecosystems, which was, on average, 1.44 and 0.47 kg C m(-2) y(-1) greater than that in Scirpus and Phragmites ecosystems, respectively. The litter decomposition rate, particularly the belowground decomposition rate, was lower for Spartina than Scirpus and Phragmites due to the lower litter quality of Spartina. The ecosystem C stock (20.94 kg m(-2)) for Spartina was greater than that for Scirpus (17.07 kg m(-2)), Phragmites (19.51 kg m(-2)) and the mudflats (15.12 kg m(-2)). Additionally, Spartina ecosystems had a significantly greater N stock (698.8 g m(-2)) than Scirpus (597.1 g m(-2)), Phragmites ecosystems (578.2 g m(-2)) and the mudflats (375.1 g m(-2)). Our results suggest that Spartina invasion altered ecophysiological processes, resulted in changes in NPP and litter decomposition, and ultimately led to enhanced ecosystem C and N stocks in the invaded ecosystems in comparison to the ecosystems with native species.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide important ecological services to the coastal zone, one of which is sediment retention. In this study we investigated sediment retention across a range of geomorphological settings and across vegetation zones comprising coastal wetlands. We selected six coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves over a gradient from riverine to tidal settings in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Each site was comprised of three distinct vegetation communities distributed as parallel zones to the coast line: seaward fringe mangroves, landward scrub mangroves and saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat of the high intertidal zone. We measured suspended sediment retention and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment transported and deposited in the mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon tracer, was used. Our results show a mean average sedimentation of 0.64 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-2) spring tide(-1), which was variable within sites, regardless of geomorphological setting. However, geomorphological setting influenced spatial patterns of sediment deposition. Riverine mangroves had a more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the fringe zone. Overall, the fringe zone retained the majority of sediment entering the coastal wetland during a tidal cycle with 0.90 +/- 0.22 mg cm(-2) spring tide(-1), accounting for 52.5 +/- 12.5% of the total sedimentation. The presence of glomalin in suspended sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting, with riverine mangroves receiving more glomalin in suspended solids than tidal mangroves. Glomalin was also differentially deposited within the vegetation zones at different geomorphological settings: primarily at the fringe zone of tidal mangroves and within the scrub zone of riverine mangroves. The differences we observed in the spatial distribution of sedimentation and the difference in the origin of the sediment deposited in riverine and tidal mangroves are likely to have an impact on ecological processes.

AB  - Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

AB  - Carbon (C) storage by vegetated coastal habitats (mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses) is globally recognized as a critical ecosystem service. Research efforts have therefore focused on quantifying C stored in these "blue carbon" ecosystems but a notable knowledge gap still exists for certain geographical regions. This study aimed to provide the first comprehensive assessment of C storage in South African warm temperate mangroves by quantifying the C storage in aboveground biomass and soil C pools associated with the mangrove forest at the Nxaxo Estuary. C storage variability was also related to mangrove forest structure and soil environmental variables. C storage was quantified using standardized protocols for aboveground (live trees, leaf litter, pneumatophores) and soil C pools at five Avicennia marina sites. The results showed soil C storage to be spatially variable while aboveground C pools were similar between intertidal zones within the sites. The soil C pool made the largest contribution to total C storage at each site and ranged from 176.91 +/- 4.5MgC.ha(-1) to 262.53 +/- 18.8 MgC. ha(-1). Of the aboveground carbon pools, live trees made the largest contribution and ranged from 2.25. 1.0 MgC.ha(-1) to 9.56 +/- 3.6 MgC.ha(-1). Across all sites, average C storage for all pools was 234.9 +/- 39.16 MgC.ha(-1), which falls within the range reported for mangroves at other southern hemisphere range limits. Variability in soil C was linearly related to soil organic matter but this relationship was inconsistent between different soil depth intervals that were sampled. Total C storage was inversely related to mangrove tree density. This study confirms the need for more blue carbon studies to quantify C storage in under-represented geographical areas and to investigate factors that drive variability in C storage at different spatial scales.

AB  - Coastal marshes have among the highest rates of soil carbon accumulation of any ecosystem on Earth, yet they are increasingly being lost due to high rates of relative sea-level rise, changes to their hydrology, and other natural and anthropogenic factors. To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.

AB  - The rapid invasion of the plant Spartina alterniflora in coastal wetland areas can threaten the capacity of their soils to store carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S). In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of C, N and S of both soil and (native and invasive) plants in four typical coastal wetlands in the core area of the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The results show that the invasive S. alterniflora greatly influenced soil properties and increased soil C, N and S storage capacity: the stock (mean +/- standard error) of soil organic carbon (SOC, (3.56 +/- 0.36) kg/m(3)), total nitrogen (TN, (0.43 +/- 0.02) kg/m(3)), and total sulfur (TS, (0.69 +/- 0.11) kg/m(3)) in the S. alterniflora marsh exceeded those in the adjacent bare mudflat, Suaeda salsa marsh, and Phragmites australis marsh. Because of its greater biomass, plant C ((1193.7 +/- 133.6) g/m(2)), N ((18.8 +/- 2.4) g/m(2)), and S ((9.4 +/- 1.5) g/m(2)) storage of S. alterniflora was also larger than those of co-occurring native plants. More biogenic elements circulated in the soil-plant system of the S. alterniflora marsh, and their spatial and temporal distribution patterns were also changed by the S. alterniflora invasion. Soil properties changed by S. alterniflora's invasion thereby indirectly affected the accumulation of soil C, N and S in this wetland ecosystem. The SOC, TN, and TS contents were positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and moisture, but negatively correlated with the pH and bulk density of soil. Together, these results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion altered ecosystem processes, resulted in changes in net primary production and litter decomposition, and increased the soil C, N and S storage capacity in the invaded ecosystems in comparison to those with native tallgrass communities in the coastal wetlands of East China.

AB  - An exotic grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to Jiuduansha wetlands in Yangtze River estuary in 1997, and since then it had rapidly replaced native plant Scirpus mariqueter that used to dominate the estuarine salt marshes. We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB  - Long-term soil chronosequences are valuable model systems for investigating pedogenesis and investigating the process of element coupling. Here, we assessed the coupling relationships among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria (Anaeromyxobacter, Geobacter, and Shewanella) in a paddy soil chronosequence of approximately 50 to 1000years. Soils of the chronosequence originated from tidal marsh under nearly identical landscape and climate conditions. During 1000years of rice cultivation, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in surface horizons (0-20cm) increased from 10.4 to 21.8gkg(-1). In contrast, total Fe contents declined from 59.6 to 45.1gkg(-1) during the initial 50years of paddy rice cultivation and then further decreased at a low rate of 0.004gkg(-1) soil year(-1) (equivalent to 10kgha(-1) soil year(-1)). Organically complexed Fe oxides (Fe-p) increased from 219 to 642mgg(-1) with increasing time of pedogenesis, but free total Fe oxides (Fe-d) and amorphous Fe oxides (Fe-o) declined at early stage of soil development, followed by a slow accumulation at later stages of the chronosequence. Gene copy numbers of Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter increased from 4.6x10(5) and 3.6x10(6) copies g(-1) to 3.8x10(7) and 3.6x10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil with continuous paddy rice cultivation, while concurrently Shewanella gene abundance decreased gradually from 4.5x10(5) to 9.3x10(4) copies g(-1) dry soil. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), different coupling relationships were observed among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria for the first 300years of paddy chronosequence and thereafter. Overall, all Fe-reducing bacteria did not show consistent variation. With the stable microbial community and iron oxide fractions, the microbially mediated dissimilatory coupling relationship between C and Fe becomes simple during 1000years of paddy soil development.

AB  - Invasive species can positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the provision of ecosystem services. The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders' density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 +/- 0.19m yr(-1) vs. -0.31 +/- 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 +/- 2.0 kg C m(-3) vs. 22.81 +/- 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 +/- 10.22 kg C m(-3)) than those with medium (13.99 +/- 1.23 kg C m(-3)) or high density (21.61 +/- 4.53 kg C m(-3)), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management.

AB  - Invasion of the exotic cordgrass, Spartina alternifiora, has become a global crisis and its spread is leading to significant alterations in the functions of ecosystems. However, alteration in nutrient levels caused by invasion of non-native plant species is poorly understood, and the effects of invasive plants on sediment nutrients found in previous studies are contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that an exotic plant species invasion will change the chemical characteristics of an ecosystem over time. To test this hypothesis, the spatial distribution of S. alternifiora in 2006, 2010 and 2014 was analyzed by aerial images, Google Earth satellite images and field investigations. Furthermore, according to the space time reciprocal principle, a primary field survey with three locations (S1, S2 and S4) was conducted in 2014, and sediment nutrient levels, including total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alternifiora. We also investigated six locations (S1 S6) in 2016 in the same manner to compare the changes in sediment nutrients between the two years. The area infested with S. alternifiora increased from 10.8 ha in 2006, to 26.2 ha in 2010, and 37.5 ha in 2014, with a 35.6% annual expansion rate between 2006 and 2010, and a 10.8% annual expansion rate between 2010 and 2014, respectively. Considering the two field survey results, we found that S. alternifiora invasion increased sediment nutrient levels in the early-term (i.e., S1-S4 period, approximately 10 years), and then significantly decreased TC, TN and TP content to levels even lower than bare beach. Analyses of stoichiometry characteristics of the sediment nutrients also verified these two apparent stages. The results showed that early-term invasion of S. alternifiora and subsequent invasion alter sediment nutrients differently, and these results may explain the seemingly contradictory increases and decreases in nutrient levels reported in previous studies. Our results provide important information that furthers our understanding of the impact of S. alterniflora invasion.

AB  - The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.
   The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

AB  - Organic matter accumulation, the net effect of plant production and decomposition, contributes to vertical soil accretion in coastal wetlands, thereby playing a key role in whether they keep pace with sea level rise. Any factor that affects decomposition may affect wetland accretion, including atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Higher CO2 can influence decomposition rates by altering plant tissue chemistry or by causing shifts in plant species composition or biomass partitioning. A combined greenhouse-field experiment examined how elevated CO2 affected plant tissue chemistry and subsequent decomposition of above- and belowground tissues of two common brackish marsh species, Schoenoplectus americanus (C-3) and Spartina patens (C-4). Both species were grown in monoculture and in mixture under ambient (350-385 mu L L-1) or elevated (ambient + 300 mu L L-1) atmospheric CO2 conditions, with all other growth conditions held constant, for one growing season. Above- and belowground tissues produced under these treatments were decomposed under ambient field conditions in a brackish marsh in the Mississippi River Delta, USA. Elevated CO2 significantly reduced nitrogen content of S. americanus, but not sufficiently to affect subsequent decomposition. Instead, long-term decomposition (percent mass remaining after 280 d) was controlled by species composition and tissue type. Shoots of S. patens had more mass remaining (41 +/- 2%) than those of S. americanus (12 +/- 2%). Belowground material decomposed more slowly than that placed aboveground (62 +/- 1% vs. 23 +/- 3% mass remaining), but rates belowground did not differ between species. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration will likely have a greater effect on overall decomposition in this brackish marsh community through shifts in species dominance or biomass allocation than through effects on tissue chemistry. Consequent changes in organic matter accumulation may alter marsh capacity to accommodate sea-level rise through vertical accretion. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A semi-arid mangrove estuary system in the northeast Brazilian coast (Ceara state) was selected for this study to (i) evaluate the impact of shrimp farm nutrient-rich wastewater effluents on the soil geochemistry and organic carbon (OC) storage and (ii) estimate the total amount of OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm). Wastewater-affected mangrove forests were referred to as WAM and undisturbed areas as Non-WAM. Redox conditions and DC content were statistically correlated (P < 0.05) with seasonality and type of land use (WAM vs. Non-WAM). Eh values were from anoxic to oxic conditions in the wet season (from -5 to 68 mV in WAM and from <40 to >400 mV in Non-WAM soils) and significantly higher (from 66 to 411 mV) in the dry season (P < 0.01). OC contents (0-40 cm soil depth) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the wet season than the dry season, and higher in Non-WAM soils than in WAM soils (values of 8.1 and 6.7 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for Non-WAM, and values of 3.8 and 2.9 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for WAM soils; P < 0.01). Iron partitioning was significantly dependent (P < 0.05) on type of land use, with a smaller degree of pyritization and lower Fe-pyrite presence in WAM soils compared to Non-WAM soils. Basal respiration of soil sediments was significantly influenced (P < 0.01) by type of land use with highest CO2 flux rates measured in the WAM soils (mean values of 0.20 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1) C vs. 0.04 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1), C). The OC storage reduction in WAM soils was potentially caused (i) by an increase in microbial activity induced by loading of nutrient-rich effluents and (ii) by an increase of strong electron acceptors [e.g., NO3-] that promote a decrease in pyrite concentration and hence a reduction in soil OC burial. The current estimated OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm) in the state of Ceara is approximately 1 million t. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing presence of successful invasive plant species can have an impact on wetlands capacity to store and release C. We have investigated the relationships between stocks of different soil organic carbon (SOC) along the soil vertical profile and invasive plant success in a China wetland. In stands dominated by the exotic invasive species Spartina alterniflora and the native invasive Phragmites australis soil organic-carbon concentrations (SOC) were higher (12% and 9%, respectively) than in plots of a native species, Cyperus malaccensis, whereas SOC content (g m(-2) ) was 18% and 17% lower under P. australis than under S. alterniffolia and C. malaccensis, respectively. Soils under both invasive species had the concentrations and contents of light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC), light-fraction organic nitrogen (LFON) at 30-60 cm of soil depth and labile organic carbon (LOC) concentrations at 0-10 cm higher than soils under native species. The invasive species had higher total aboveground, total biomasses and lower shoot:root ratios than the native species. The success of both invasive species was associated with higher growth rates and accumulation of nutrients in biomass than in the native species and also accumulation of C in plant soil system. The stands currently dominated by the invasive species were recently occupied by monospecific stands of the native C. malaccensis, strongly suggesting that all or most of the current soil differences were due to the invasions. Higher sand fraction in C. malaccensis community and higher clay fraction in P. australis community relative to the native species, were correlated with higher soil N and P concentrations in invaded stands. The results suggest that different vegetation cover with distinct shoot/root ratio can change soil structure by favoring sedimentation of different particle size classes. Thus, despite both invasive species have some common traits, the results also showed that different invasive species with partially distinct impacts on soil and nutrient uses can succeed under the same conditions. The traits conferring invasive success are thus not necessarily species-specific. A clear change in the general accumulation of C, N and P in the plant-soil system was related to the invasive plant success in this wetland areas.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), ER (660.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), GEP (-2025.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.

AB  - Wetlands play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer. These field-experimental warming results suggested that in temperate P. australis wetlands without tidal impacts, climate warming might increase the soil organic C pools while exerting no effect on microbial C decomposition, whereas the N and P cycling that is mediated by soil microbes might be enhanced by moderate warming.

AB  - Coastal wetland soils store large amounts of organic carbon, which is becoming vulnerable to environmental changes such as exotic species invasion and climate change. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.
   Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.

AB  - Soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and stoichiometries can be used to evaluate the success indicators to the effects of wetland restoration and reflect ecosystem function. Restoration of inland soda saline-alkali wetlands is widespread, however, the soil nutrition changes that follow restoration are unclear. We quantified the recovery trajectories of soil physicochemical properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) pools, for a chronosequence of three restored wetlands (7 yr, 12 yr and 21 yr) and compared these properties to those of degraded and natural wetlands in the western Songnen Plain, Northeast China. Wetland degradation lead to the loss of soil nutrients. Relative to natural wetlands, the mean reductions of in SOC, TN, and TP concentrations were 89.6%, 65.5% and 52.5%, respectively. Nutrients recovered as years passed after restoration. The SOC, TN, and TP concentrations increased by 2.36 times, 1.15 times, and 0.83 times, respectively in degraded wetlands that had been restored for 21 yr, but remained 29.2%, 17.3%, and 12.8% lower, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C:N (R-CN), C:P (R-CP), and N:P (R-NP) ratios increased from 5.92 to 8.81, 45.36 to 79.19, and 7.67 to 8.71, respectively in the wetland that had been restored for 12 yr. These results were similar to those from the natural wetland and the wetland that had been restored for 21 yr (P > 0.05). Soil nutrients changes occurred mainly in the upper layers (<= 30 cm), and no significant differences were found in deeper soils (> 30 cm). Based on this, we inferred that it would take at least 34 yr for SOC, TN, and TP concentrations and 12 yr for R-CN, R-CP, and R-NP in the top soils of degraded wetlands to recover to levels of natural wetlands. Soil salinity negatively influenced SOC (r =.0.704, P < 0.01), TN (r =.0.722, P < 0.01), and TP (r =.0.882, P < 0.01) concentrations during wetland restoration, which indicates that reducing salinity is beneficial to SOC, TN, and TP recovery. Moreover, plants were an important source of soil nutrients and vegetation restoration was conducive to soil nutrient accumulation. In brief, wetland restoration increased the accumulation of soil biogenic elements, which indicated that positive ecosystem functions changes had occurred.

AB  - While soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stabilization has been increasingly the focus of ecosystem properties, how it could be linked to soil biological activity enhancement has been poorly assessed. In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.

AB  - Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services along the southeastern region of the United States, but are threatened by anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Here, we examined the species composition, mortality, aboveground biomass, and carbon content of vegetation and soils in natural pine forests of the lower coastal plain in eastern North Carolina, USA. We compared a forest clearly in decline (termed "ghost forest") adjacent to a roadside canal that had been installed as drainage for a road next to an adjacent forest subject to "natural" hydrology, unaltered by human modification (termed "healthy forest"). We also assessed how soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation changed over time using C-14 radiocarbon dating of wood sampled at different depths within the peat profile. Our results showed that the ghost forest had a higher tree density at 687 trees ha(-1), and was dominated by swamp bays (Persea palustric), compared to the healthy forest, which had 265 trees ha(-1) dominated by pond pine (Pinus serotina Michx). Overstory tree mortality of the ghost forest was nearly ten times greater than the healthy forest (p < 0.05), which actually contributed to higher total aboveground biomass (55.9 +/- 12.6 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 27.9 +/- 8.7 Mg ha(-1) in healthy forest), as the dead standing tree biomass (snags) added to that of an encroaching woody shrub layer during ecosystem transition. Therefore, the total aboveground C content of the ghost forest, 33.98 +/- 14.8 Mg C ha(-1), was higher than the healthy forest, 24.7 +/- 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) (p < 0.05). The total SOC stock down to a 2.3 m depth in the ghost forest was 824.1 +/- 46.2 Mg C ha(-1), while that of the healthy forest was 749.0 +/- 170.5 Mg C ha(-1) (p > 0.05). Carbon dating of organic sediments indicated that, as the sample age approaches modern times (surface layer year 2015), the organic soil accumulation rate (1.11 to 1.13 mm year(-1)) is unable to keep pace with the estimated rate of recent sea level rise (2.1 to 2.4 mm year(-1)), suggesting a causative relationship with the ecosystem transition occurring at the site. Increasing hydrologic stress over recent decades appears to have been a major driver of ecosystem transition, that is, ghost forest formation and woody shrub encroachment, as indicated by the far higher overstory tree mortality adjacent to the drainage ditch, which allows the inland propagation of hydrologic/salinity forcing due to SLR and extreme storms. Our study documents C accumulation in a coastal wetland over the past two millennia, which is now threatened due to the recent increase in the rate of SLR exceeding the natural peat accumulation rate, causing an ecosystem transition with unknown consequences for the stored C; however, much of it will eventually be returned to the atmosphere. More studies are needed to determine the causes and consequences of coastal ecosystem transition to inform the modeling of future coastal wetland responses to environmental change and the estimation of regional terrestrial C stocks and flux.

AB  - Mangrove- and saltmarsh-dominated estuaries have high rates of organic carbon burial. Here, we estimate soil, pore water, and surface-water carbon fluxes in an Australian estuarine tidal creek to assess whether (1) advective pore water exchange releases some of the soil carbon, (2) outwelling (lateral exports) represents a major carbon sequestration mechanism, and (3) methane emissions offset soil carbon sequestration. A radon (Rn-222) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 +/- 3.6 to 15.6 +/- 8.1 cm d(-1). Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. Organic carbon burial in soils derived from Pu239 + 240 dating was 11-63 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Methane and carbon dioxide emissions at the water-air interface were 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 63 +/- 166 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. When calculated as CO2-equivalents, aquatic CH4 emissions converted to 19-94 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset < 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) catchment d(-1)) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial. Because much of this DIC remains in the ocean after air-water equilibration, lateral DIC exports may represent an important long-term carbon sink. Recent research has focused on quantifying carbon burial rates in blue carbon habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves. We suggest that DIC outwelling and methane outgassing should also be considered when assessing the carbon sequestration capacity of these coastal vegetated habitats.

AB  - Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.

AB  - Purpose We investigated S. alterniflora saltmarshes in 10 regions to distinguish the major sources of soil organic carbon (SOC) and provide data for SOC content in Chinese coastal wetlands under exotic invasion. Methods We collected soil and plant samples. We analyzed the soil properties for SOC content, recalcitrant organic carbon (RC), labile organic carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total salinity and water content, as well as stable isotopic carbon composition (delta C-13) in the SOC and RC. SOC and RC were determined using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer. We used delta C-13 values and C/N ratios of the SOC to identify carbon source inputs. The delta C-13 of the SOC and RC was measured using a Sercon Integra CN isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Results The results showed that the S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC pool properties differed significantly between study areas, dependent upon local circumstances and carbon exchanges. The delta C-13 values of SOC in surface sediments from Tianjin to Guangxi were from -25.16 to -20.64 parts per thousand, RC from -27.82 to -23.1 parts per thousand, and C/N ratios between 11.36 and 19.00. These samples had SOC values of 14.77-23.95 g kg(-1), RC values of 11.98-21.44 g kg(-1), and LC values of 0.44-4.08 g kg(-1). The SOC and RC of surface sediments were positively correlated with TN and TP. Conclusions S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC is derived from multiple carbon inputs including from marine and land sources and its formation is driven by complicated factors. TN and TP inputs increase SOC in coastal wetlands. Generally, terrigenous carbon inputs dominate the SOC composition in Chinese coastal wetlands, although marine-derived organic carbon (OC) inputs to sediment increase from northern to southern areas.

AB  - Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and saltmarsh environments, can store significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC); however, most studies focus on tropical and subtropical environments. We assessed SOC stocks and fractions in temperate mangrove (two sites) and saltmarsh (sites SM1, SM2 and SM3) environments in southern Australia. The SOC fractions were separated according to particulate organic carbon (POC), humic carbon (HC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) by size fractionation. Saltmarsh sites generally had the highest SOC content (up to 12.4% SOC). The POC fraction was the highest at the surface in the saltmarsh site and decreased relative to the HC and RC fractions with depth. Conversely, the proportion of POC at the mangrove sites did not decrease with depth, forming up to 76% of the SOC. The vertical displacement of soil of up to 5.8 mm year(-1) at the saltmarsh sites, measured using root ingrowth bags, suggest significant contributions of POC via root materials. Retention of these POC inputs are likely to be related to waterlogging, which decreases decomposition rates - with much lower soil moisture content at SM1, where the lowest POC content occurred below the surface, compared with SM2 and SM3.

AB  - Salt accumulation gradually changes the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and may even transform sinks into sources in arid wetlands. However, it's not clear how hydrochemical characteristics affect the wetland's source or sink function or how they affect C, N, and P cycling in arid regions. To clarify these relationships, we conducted field measurement in arid northern China. We simulated the variations of hydrochemical characteristics and the storage and stoichiometry of C, N, and P using the process-based DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Hydrus-1D models. The meteorological and hydrological processes had obvious characteristics of seasonal and interannual changes. The measured evapotranspiration averaged 660.23 and 587.94 mm year(-1)in the saltmarsh and riparian wetlands, respectively. The soil showed a clear trend with higher SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl(-)fractions in comparison with lower Mg2+, K+, and HCO(3)(-)fractions, with the major ion and nutrient concentrations gradually decreasing with increasing depth in the soil. The major ion types had characteristics of Na+-Ca2+-SO42--Cl(-)in the saltmarsh wetland and riparian wetland. The storage of total C, N, and P were 372.72 +/- 66.52 t C/hm(2), 10.92 +/- 2.59 t N/hm(2), and 17.55 +/- 1.54 t P/hm(2)in the saltmarsh wetland versus 119.72 +/- 27.88 t C/hm(2), 4.38 +/- 1.24 t N/hm(2), and 13.17 +/- 1.46 t P/hm(2)in the riparian wetland. Therefore, wetland salinization in our study led to increased soil C, N, and P contents and storage and thereby enhanced the sink function of the wetlands.

AB  - As an aggressive invasive saltmarsh plant in many places worldwide, Spartina alterniflora has a wide distribution range in latitude. Previous studies have explored latitudinal trends in S. alterniflora productivity in its native regions using meta- analysis, whereas to the best of our knowledge, that in China as its largest invaded regions have not been reported. In this study, we performed meta-analysis to explore latitudinal trends in productivity as measured by the end-of-season-live (EOSL) biomass of S. alterniflora along a broad latitudinal gradient from 24 degrees N to 34 degrees N on the coast of China. The results showed that in stark contrast to the linear decreasing trend found along the East Coast of North America as its native region, the latitudinal variation of the consolidated EOSL biomass along the coast of China exhibited an erratic "W"-shape and fell within the range of variation of the surveyed biomass reported in the literature. Additionally, the EOSL biomass was not correlated with climatic factors, such as the mean annual temperature and mean annual growing degree-days. The results of this study complement the ever-growing literature of S. alterniflora in China from a consolidated perspective and indicate that the response of S. alterniflora productivity to climate change could be more complicated in invaded regions.

AB  - Estuarine wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, providing unique habitats for fish and many terrestrial species. They also have a carbon sequestration capacity that surpasses terrestrial forest. In NSW, and most of south eastern Australia, they typically display a vegetation zonation with a sequence mudflats - mangrove forest - saltmarsh plains from the seaward margin and up the topographic gradient. Estuarine wetlands respond to sea-level rise by vertical accretion and horizontal landward migration, in order to maintain their position in the tidal frame. In situations in which accretion cannot compensate for sea-level rise and buffer areas for landward migration are not available, estuarine vegetation can be lost due to unsuitable hydraulic conditions. Predicting estuarine wetlands response to sea-level rise requires simultaneous modelling of water flow, soil and vegetation dynamics. This paper presents some preliminary results of our recently developed numerical model for wetland dynamics in wetlands of the Hunter estuary of NSW. The model continuously simulates tidal inputs into the wetland and vegetation types are determined based on their preference to prevailing hydrodynamic conditions. Accretion values based on vegetation types are computed and the topography is updated accordingly. The model is driven by local information collected over several years, which include estuary water levels, accretion rates, soil carbon content, flow resistance and vegetation preference to hydraulic conditions. Model results predict further wetland loss under an accelerated sea-level rise scenario and also under current conditions of moderate increase of estuary water levels.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of coastal soils in China have changed due to the development of reclaimed stretches of coastline, which has a significant impact on the dynamics of organic carbon (OC) in the soils. We evaluated changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils in both a natural area and a reclaimed area along the coast of Rudong County, China, as well as the effects that these changes had on the OC content of the soils. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was used to determine which factors are most important for driving changes in soil OC at four sites from each area. According to dominant vegetation types, there were significant differences in soil physical and chemical properties and OC content between the reclaimed area and natural coastal area. The mean grain size and pH increased gradually with depth, and values were highest in reclaimed areas. Mean total N (TN), P, and S, salinity, water content, and soil OC were highest in natural areas and decreased with depth. The PLSR model determined that TN, silt content, and sand content were the most important factors affecting soil OC in the reclaimed area, whereas TN, clay content, and water content were important factors affecting soil OC dynamics in the natural coastal areas. This study provides important reference data for correctly assessing the role and status of coastal areas in the global carbon cycle.

AB  - The ability of the simultaneously extracted metals/acid volatile sulfides ( n-ary sumation SEM/AVS) index to ascertain environmental risk from potentially toxic elements in calcareous saltmarsh soils was tested using structural equation modeling. This technique allows the detection of both direct and indirect relationships among AVS, SEM, and other soil variables, representing results in a graphical view. The dataset included 90 soil samples from 21 different sites belonging to 6 different saltmarshes and featured a wide range of soil chemicophysical properties. Variables included in the a priori model were hydroperiod, pH, soil redox potential, labile organic carbon, carbonates, total iron, and total amount of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The best optimized model pointed out the main soil properties that affect AVS accumulation and SEM speciation in these soils. Effect plots of AVS and SEM calculated with the partial linear mixed-effects models included in the piecewise structural equation modeling showed a significant and positive influence of pH and carbonates on AVS and a highly significant effect of carbonates and labile organic carbon on SEM. Single SEM components were also considered separately, to define the potential contributions of labile organic carbon or carbonates as alternative binding phases. Simultaneously extracted Cu, Ni, and Zn were preferentially bound to carbonates, followed by labile organic carbon, whereas Pb and Cd were easily bound to labile organic carbon.

AB  - We investigated the effects of tidal inundation and grazing pressure on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization and plant community characteristics in the predominant plant communities used by breeding black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) in southwestern Alaska. Three plant communities dominate the outer coastal zone, the lowest in elevation being Carex subspathacea grazing lawns, the next being C. ramenskii meadows, and the highest being a slough levee community. We flooded each of these communities in the field with tidal waters (mean total dissolved salts 28.3 +/- 0.7 g L-1) at different frequencies for two growing seasons. Relative to controls, treatments that were flooded weekly had soils that had two-, three-, and six-fold increases in salinity in the C. subspathacea, C. ramenskii, and slough levee communities, respectively. We detected no effect of flooding on either soil carbon or nitrogen mineralization, nor any effect on live plant standing biomass and net aboveground primary productivity in the most coastal communities, those dominated by C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii. Biomass in the slough levee community was lower in plots that had soil salinities six times higher than the ambient soil salinity. This effect resulted from an 83% decline in woody vegetation. Grass biomass, predominately Poa arctica and Deschampsia caespitosa, increased in these plots, however, and maintained the productivity of this community relative to controls. Geese reduced the biomass of a preferred forage species (Triglochin palustris) by 50% over two growing seasons within the slough levee community. Carex subspathacea compensated for the loss of over 95% of its production by geese, even in soils that had twice the ambient salinity. The C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii communities are resistant to short-term tidal inundation and elevated soil salinities, and grazing by geese is responsible for maintaining their community boundaries. Elevated soil salinity and tidal inundation restricts the development of woody vegetation in the slough levee community, but graminoids compensate for the reduction in woody biomass and maintain the overall productivity of this community.

AB  - Plain Language Summary Mangroves are blue carbon systems characterized by high soil carbon storage and sequestration. Soil carbon losses via groundwater or pore water pathways are potentially important yet poorly understood components of mangrove carbon budgets. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) fluxes into a mangrove-dominated tropical bay (Maowei Sea) using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model. The SGD fluxes in Maowei Sea were estimated to be 4.9x10(7) (0.360.33m/day) and 2.6x10(7)m(3)/day (0.200.18m/day) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively, implying that SGD may respond to precipitation. The SGD-derived DIC and DOC fluxes (molm(-2)day(-1)) in the wet season (DIC: 0.700.82; DOC: 0.310.30) were higher than those in the dry season (DIC: 0.250.24; DOC: 0.25 +/- 0.23). These SGD-derived carbon fluxes exceed local river inputs and constituted >70% of the total DIC and DOC input into the bay. If scaled up to the global weighted mangrove area in combination with data from other 32 study sites, carbon fluxes via SGD into mangroves may be equivalent to 29-48% of the global riverine input into the ocean. Therefore, we suggest that SGD is a major component of coastal carbon budgets and that accounting for SGD helps to reduce uncertainties in mangrove blue carbon budgets.
   Mangrove soils sequester large amounts of carbon, but little is known on the loss of carbon via groundwater pathways. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge using radon and related dissolved inorganic and organic carbon fluxes in a mangrove-dominated tropical bay in China (Maowei Sea). Combining our results with literature data revealed that groundwater fluxes in mangroves are significant and should be considered in blue carbon assessments.

AB  - Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO(2)e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO(2)e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO(2)e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

AB  - Aims Among terrestrial ecosystems, coastal sandy dunes are particularly prone to alien plant invasion. Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.
   Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.
   Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.

AB  - Tidal regime is recognized as a vital hydrological process in the restructuring of saltmarsh vegetation communities, resulting in differing edaphic conditions and ecosystem functions. Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of potential interactive effects between plant traits and tidal disturbances in regulating biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon sequestration, in coastal saltmarsh systems.

AB  - Saltmarshes provide many valuable ecosystem services including storage of a large amount of 'blue carbon' within their soils. To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for 'blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.

AB  - Coastal vegetation (seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh) termed "blue carbon'' systems have recently been noted for their potentially large carbon storage capacities. This study quantifies sedimentary blue carbon stocks in an urban estuary containing seagrass (Zostera muelleri), mangrove (Avicennia marina), and saltmarsh (Sporobolus virginicus) habitats in the Coffs Creek Estuary (NSW, Australia). The objective of this study is to investigate the carbon storage dynamics, including the evaluation of potential influences from the plant cover and geomorphology. The sediment carbon stock results presented in this work show that mangroves store more carbon, 1070 +/- 827 compared to 858 +/- 190 and 365 +/- 255 Mg ha(-1) than saltmarsh and seagrass, respectively. These results are of interest because in Coffs Creek alone, mangroves have expanded (in area) by more than 25% from 1986 to 2011. The large sediment carbon stocks found in this urban system emphasize the benefits of restoring and protecting these ecosystems as a way of offsetting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

AB  - Wetland soils are globally important carbon stores, and natural wetlands provide a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through ongoing carbon accumulation. Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

AB  - Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of C-14-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB  - Aims The effects of invasive plants on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are widely documented, while the mechanisms of their influences on the microbial ecology of soil remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N. These changes further potentially impacted ecosystem C and N cycles in the coastal zone of China.

AB  - In the subtropics, climate change is pushing woody mangrove forests into herbaceous saltmarshes, altering soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools, with implications for coastal wetland productivity and C and N exports. We quantified total C and N pools, and mobile fractions including extractable mineral N, extractable organic C and N, and active (aerobically mineralizable) C and N, in surface soils (top 7.6 cm) of adjacent mangrove (primarily Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh (Juncus roemerianus) vegetation zones in tidal wetlands of west-central Florida (USA). We tested whether surface-soil accumulations of C, N, and their potentially mobile fractions are greater in mangrove than in saltmarsh owing to greater accumulations in the mangrove zone of soil organic matter (SOM) and fine mineral particles (C- and N-retaining soil constituents). Extractable organic fractions were 39-45% more concentrated in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soil, and they scaled steeply and positively with SOM and fine mineral particle (silt + clay) concentrations, which themselves were likewise greater in mangrove soil. Elevation may drive this linkage. Mangrove locations were generally at lower elevations, which tended to have greater fine particle content in the surface soil. Active C and extractable mineral N were marginally (p < 0.1) greater in mangrove soil, while active N, total N, and total C showed no statistical differences between zones. Extractable organic C and N fractions composed greater shares of total C and N pools in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soils, which is meaningful for ecosystem function, as persistent leaching of this fraction can perpetuate nutrient limitation. The active (mineralizable) C and N fractions we observed constituted a relatively small component of total C and N pools, suggesting that mangrove surface soils may export less C and N than would be expected from their large total C and N pools.

AB  - Amino acids, either in a free or polymeric state, represent a significant addition of N to most ecosystems and therefore comprise a key pool in the soil nitrogen cycle. The ability of some plants to take up amino acids directly from soil may confer a competitive advantage particularly in N-limited environments. Whilst measurements of inorganic N concentrations (NH4+ and NO3-) are routinely undertaken on either soil solutions or soil water/KCl extracts, there is a need,for a supplementary procedure to determine free amino acids and enable determination of all plant-available pools. The aim of this study is to develop and test a procedure for the rapid and sensitive determination of total free amino acids in soil solutions and soil extracts (water or 2 M KCl) and to compare this with the standard ninhydrin method of Moore and Stein (1954). The spectrofluorometric procedure relies on the reaction of free amino acids with o-phthaldialdehyde and beta-mercaptoethanol. The fluorometric method is much more sensitive (working range 0.1-50 muM) than typical spectrophotometric analysis procedures for free amino acids which employs the ninhydrin reagent (working range 10-500 muM). In addition, the method only requires small sample volumes (0.1-50 mul), is rapid (1 min sample(-1)), simple to perform, and linear over a concentration range of three orders of magnitude (0.1-100 muM). The method was used to determine free amino acid concentrations across a range of ecosystem types (upland and lowland grasslands, forest, heathland and coastal saltmarsh). Generally, the concentration of free amino acids in soil solution was low and relatively independent of soil type. The average soluble N concentrations across all sites (n = 7) were 24 +/- 8 muM for amino acids, 39 +/- 14 muM for NH4+ and 67 +/- 42 muM for NO3-. Free amino acids typically constituted 10-40% of the total soluble N in the soil solution and therefore comprise a significant soluble N and plant available pool in soil.
