AB  - In 2008, we studied contents of soil organic matters(SOM) and total sulfur(TS) in the surface and subsurface soils in nine typical sampling points that covered with different plant communities in the wetland of Yellow River Estuary in order to identify the influences of different plant communities. Results showed the contents of SOM varied in irregular "M" mode except for 0-10cm soil layer. The characteristics of vertical distribution were resemble of different sites in the whole, decreasing along with the depth though existing some waves. The diversity was remarkable (C.V. > 10%), showing as medium variability. For TS, contents decreased with plant communities succession. But the characteristics of vertical distribution was not very significant. Correlation analysis showed that SOM contents had significant correlation with TN contents(r=0.955, p<0.01), TP contents were closely linked with SOM and nitrogen contents, but TS contents had no remarkable correlation with any other element.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide and Methane Emissions From Temperate Salt Marsh Tidal Creek
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes store large amounts of carbon but the magnitude and patterns of greenhouse gas (GHG; i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) fluxes are unclear. Information about GHG fluxes from these ecosystems comes from studies of sediments or at the ecosystem-scale (eddy covariance) but fluxes from tidal creeks are unknown. We measured GHG concentrations in water, water quality, meteorological parameters, sediment CO2 efflux, ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes, and plant phenology; all at half-hour intervals over 1 year. Manual creek GHG flux measurements were used to calculate gas transfer velocity (k) and parameterize a model of water-to-atmosphere GHG fluxes. The creek was a source of GHGs to the atmosphere where tidal patterns controlled diel variability. Dissolved oxygen and wind speed were negatively correlated with creek CH4 efflux. Despite lacking a seasonal pattern, creek CO2 efflux was correlated with drivers such as turbidity across phenological phases. Overall, nighttime creek CO2 efflux (3.6 0.63 mu mol/m(2)/s) was at least 2 times higher than nighttime marsh sediment CO2 efflux (1.5 1.23 mu mol/m(2)/s). Creek CH4 efflux (17.5 6.9 nmol/m(2)/s) was 4 times lower than ecosystem-scale CH4 fluxes (68.1 52.3 nmol/m(2)/s) across the year. These results suggest that tidal creeks are potential hotspots for CO2 emissions and could contribute to lateral transport of CH4 to the coastal ocean due to supersaturation of CH4 (>6,000 mu mol/mol) in water. This study provides insights for modeling GHG efflux from tidal creeks and suggests that changes in tide stage overshadow water temperature in determining magnitudes of fluxes.Key PointsA tidal creek was a hotspot for CO2 efflux compared to the surrounding wetland Changes in tide stage, not water temperature variability, regulated diel creek CO2 and CH4 efflux The relative influence of nontidal drivers of creek CO2 and CH4 efflux varied by plant phenological phases

TI  - Phosphorus fractions and profile distribution in newly formed wetland soils along a salinity gradient in the Yellow River Delta in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil P availability has been identified as one of the key factors controlling wetland productivity, structure, and function. Soil P fractions at different depths in newly formed wetlands along a salinity gradient in Yellow River Delta (China) were studied using a modified Hedley fraction method. The total P (Pt) content ranged from 471.1 to 694.9 mg?kg1, and diluted HCl-extractable inorganic P (Dil-HCl-Pi) ranged from 324 to 524.2 mg?kg1. The Dil-HCl-Pi is the predominant P form in all profiles, with on average 70% of the Pt extracted as Pi. Organic P (Po) comprised (4.2 +/- 2.0)% (mean +/- SD) of the Pt, due to low organic-matter content in coastal salt marsh ecosystems. The labile P (resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi, and NaHCO3-Po) and moderately labile P (NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po) concentrations were both low, ranged from 11.6 to 38.1 and 2.8 to 21.3 mg?kg1, respectively, constituting (3.7 +/- 1.1)% and (2.0 +/- 0.7)%, respectively, of Pt, suggesting low availability of P to plants in these soils. Our results suggested that vegetation cover significantly influenced soil P dynamics and availability. In particular, the labile P content under Tamarix chinensis increased significantly by 23.2%145.5% compared with adjacent soils. These findings have important implications for wetland conservation or restoration and long-term sustainable management of newly formed wetland ecosystems in the Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Methane (CH4) emission from a tidal marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total methane emission to the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and its seasonal variation, were estimated using an enclosed static chamber technique from a tidal marshes dominated by Phragmites australis (common reed) in the Min River estuary, southeast China. Measurements were taken at three tidal stages ( before flood, during the flooding and ebbing process, and after ebb). Potential rates of methane production from the marsh sediment layers were also measured using an incubation technique. This P. australis tidal marsh was a net methane source, emitting 32.59 and 6.87 g CH4.m(-2).yr(-1) to the atmosphere and hydrosphere, respectively. There was considerable monthly variation with emissions greater before flood in some months, whereas at other months emission was greater after ebb. The average methane fluxes were 5.13, 5.06 and 4.74 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) before flood, during flooding and ebbing, and after ebb, respectively. Emissions to the tidewater and the atmosphere during the flooding and ebbing process were 2.98 and 2.08 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Sediment methane production potential (0-40 cm depth) ranged from 0.028-0.123 mu g CH4.g(-1).d(-1), with the greatest production was in the surface soil. Methane fluxes had a significant correlation with atmospheric, sediment temperature and above ground biomass. The implications of these data for global warming are discussed briefly.

TI  - Calibration of pollen assemblages and carbon-nitrogen ratios to discriminate boreal wetland types
T2  - REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Differentiation of boreal wetlands in the palaeo record is required for studies of isostacy and sea level change, landscape change, and climate dynamics. To develop palynomorph signatures and calibrate soil C-N ratios for boreal wetlands we sampled low and high elevation tidal marshes, fens and bogs along eastern James Bay, Canada. A discriminant analysis model showed that a small subset of palynomorph taxa can effectively discriminate between the four wetland types. Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Potamogeton-Triglochin-type are important to the classification of high marshes. Bryidae spores and pollen of Myrica gale, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae are indicative of fen. Moss spores alone, primarily from Sphagnum, but also Bryidae type spores, derived from brown mosses are the indicators of bog. The use of palynomorph assemblages to discriminate among wetland types is not dependent upon the localized presence of a plant source as it would be using macrofossil analysis. C/N of bog soils can be clearly distinguished from fen and tidal marshes and can be used as a pollen-independent proxy to indicate fen to bog wetland succession. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in two contrastive fringing zones of coastal lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) simultaneously in two typical fringing zones, sandy shore and salt marsh, of coastal lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan, in mid-summer 2003. Our aim was to quantify net the greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes and examine key factors, which control variation of the GHGs fluxes in the two sites. Net CO2 and CH4 fluxes were markedly different between the two sites; magnitudes and variations of the both fluxes in sandy shore were lower than those of salt marsh. Meanwhile, magnitude and variation of net N2O flux in the two sites were similar. In sandy shore, temporal and spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were highly controlled by water level fluctuation derived from astronomic tide. In salt marsh, spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were correlated with aboveground biomass, and temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were correlated with soil temperature. The sum of global warming potential, which was roughly estimated using the observed GHGs fluxes, was ca. 174-fold higher in salt marsh than in sandy shore. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analyzing the Long-Term Phenological Trends of Salt Marsh Ecosystem across Coastal LOUISIANA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the phenology of the salt marsh ecosystem across coastal Louisiana (LA) for a 16-year time period (2000-2015) using NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer's (MODIS) eight-day average surface reflectance images (500 m). We compared the performances of least squares fitted asymmetric Gaussian (AG) and double logistic (DL) smoothing functions in terms of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from the raw phenology derived from the time-series composites. We performed derivative analysis to determine the appropriate start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) thresholds. After that, we extracted the seasonality parameters in TIMESAT, and studied the effect of environmental disturbances/anomalies on the seasonality parameters. Finally, we performed trend analysis using the derived seasonality parameters such as base green biomass (GBM) value, maximum GBM value, seasonal amplitude, and small seasonal integral. Based on root mean square error (RMSE) values and residual plots, we selected the best thresholds for SOS (5% of amplitude) and EOS (20% of amplitude), along with the best smoothing function. The selected SOS and EOS thresholds were able to capture the environmental disturbances that have affected the salt marsh ecosystem during the 16-year time period. Our trend analysis results indicate positive trends in the base GBM values in the salt marshes of LA. However, we did not notice as much of a positive trend in the maximum GBM levels. Hence, we observed mostly negative changes in the GBM amplitude and small seasonal integral values. These negative changes indicated the overall progressive decline in the rates of photosynthesis and biomass allocation in the LA salt marsh ecosystem, which is most likely due to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and sea level rise. The results illustrate both the relative efficiency of MODIS-based biophysical models for analyzing salt marsh phenology, and performances of the smoothing techniques in terms of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the MODIS-derived phenology.

M3  - Data set
AB  - Food web theory predicts that current global declines in marine predators could generate unwanted consequences for many marine ecosystems. In coastal plant communities (kelp, seagrass, mangroves, and salt marsh), several studies have documented the far-reaching effects of changing predator populations. Across coastal ecosystems, the loss of marine predators appears to negatively affect coastal plant communities and the ecosystem services they provide. Here, we discuss some of the documented and suspected effects of predators on coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and the stability and resilience of coastal plant communities. In addition, we present a meta-analysis to assess the strength and direction of trophic cascades in kelp forests, seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves. We demonstrate that the strength and direction of trophic cascades varied across ecosystem types, with predators having a large positive effect on plants in salt marshes, a moderate positive effect on plants in kelp and mangroves, and no effect on plants in seagrasses. Our analysis also identified that there is a paucity of literature on trophic cascades for all four coastal plant systems, but especially seagrass and mangroves. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of predators in maintaining coastal ecosystem services, but also highlights the need for further research before large-scale generalizations about the prevalence, direction, and strength of trophic cascade in coastal plant communities can be made.

TI  - Addressing the Fouling of In Situ Ultraviolet-Visual Spectrometers Used to Continuously Monitor Water Quality in Brackish Tidal Marsh Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of portable in situ ultraviolet-visual spectrometers has made possible the collection of water quality parameters at a high frequency in dynamic systems such as tidal marshes. The usefulness of this technology is inhibited by fouling of the instrument's optics. In this study, a spectrometer fitted with manufacturer-recommended compressed air optical cleaning was installed in a brackish marsh to determine if fouling interfered with measurements between biweekly servicing. During a 2-wk period, the absorbance measured in air at 220 nm increased from 9 to 549 m(-1), indicating major fouling. An antifouling system was developed that reduced the time of exposure of the optics to stream water and used a pressurized fresh water cleaning. After implementation of the system, the absorbance in air increased to at most 63 m(-1) after 2 wk of data collection. The dramatic reduction in fouling will allow quality long-term data to be collected using this technology.

AB  - Data from an accounting of the woodland fund, from forestry and soil science investigations, and of dynamics of logging and forest-drying reclamation were used to calculate the stocks and balance of organic carbon in forest and marsh biogeocenoses of Karelia. The carbon stock in forest ecosystems equals 1.13 billion tons (128.3 t/ha), and in marsh ecosystems 3.74 billion tons (1030.0 tons/ha). In both cases, the bulk of the stocks are located in the soil. The balance of carbon in forest biogeocenoses currently is negative (-2.34 million tons), while in marshes it is positive (+0.88 million tons).

TI  - Below-ground biomass in healthy and impaired salt marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Congress of Ecology
CL  - SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Twelve salt marshes in south Louisiana (USA) were classified as either 'impaired' or 'healthy' before a summer sample collection of above- and below-ground biomass and determination of sediment accretion rates. The above-ground biomass of plant tissues was the same at both impaired and healthy salt marshes and was not a good predictor of marsh health. However, below-ground root biomass in the upper 30 cm was much lower in the impaired marshes compared to the healthy marshes. Compromises to root production apparently occur before there is an obvious consequence to the above-ground biomass, which may quickly collapse before remedial action can be taken. The subsequent change in vertical position of the marsh surface may be equivalent to many years of accretion, and be irreversible within decades without considerable effort. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the plant's below-ground accumulation of organic matter, not inorganic matter that governs the maintenance of salt marsh ecosystem in the vertical plane. Reversing the precursor conditions leading to marsh stress before the collapse of the above-ground biomass occurs is therefore a prudent management objective and could be easier than restoration.

TI  - Storage of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil-plant system of Phragmites australis stands from a eutrophicated Mediterranean salt marsh
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

TI  - Variability in soil microbial community and activity between coastal and riparian wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary - Potential impacts on carbon sequestration
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Short-term effects of NaCl and Na2SO4 on nitrogen mineralization in the soil in three marshes of the Liaohe River estuary
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - NaCl and Na2SO4 are the key factors affecting nitrogen (N) mineralization in the soil of estuarine wetlands. However, it remains unclear how N mineralization responses to NaCl and Na2SO4. In the present study, samples of topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (10-20 cm) were collected in three marshes, including a Phragmites australis marsh (Pa-marsh), a Suaeda salsa marsh (Ss-marsh) and a mudflat marsh (Mu-marsh), in the Liaohe River estuary. The soil samples were treated by NaCl and Na2SO4, with a set of salinity levels of 0 %Es, 2 %Es, 5 %Es, 10 %Es, 20 %Es and 100 %Es (%Es, percent of equivalent seawater), respectively. After incubating the soil samples for 2 weeks, the contents of NH4+-N and NO3--N were measured and the net N mineralization rates (R-min) were calculated. We found that NH4+-N and NO3--N accumulations in the soil samples of the three marshes in the NaCl and Na2SO4 treatments. Both NaCl and Na2SO4 significantly affected R-min for the top soil for Pa-marsh in all salinity treatments, whereas salt-effects for Ss- and Mu-marsh soils were only found at 10 %Es and/or 20 %Es levels in the NaCl treatments. There was an ion-specific effect of NaCl and Na2SO4 on N mineralization. NaCl increased R-min by 114-164% and 86-139% in the topsoil and subsoil of the three marshes, respectively; Na2SO4 increased R-min by 234% in the topsoil of Pa-marsh and had no effect on R-min in the other soils. A salt threshold of 50-60%Es was found for NaCl and Na2SO4 impacting on N mineralization of Pa-marsh soil. Salt type, salinity level, wetland type and soil layer were the main factors impacting the N mineralization. The results suggest that the effect of salt on N mineralization could vary with salt type and soil properties.

TI  - Sea level rise sedimentary record and organic carbon fluxes in a low-lying tropical coastal ecosystem
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise, one of the most evident effects of recent climate change, is already impacting coastal ecosystems. Because of its low relief, population increase and economic development during the last century, the Celestun lagoon is highly vulnerable to global change, including sea level rise. Here, we study a sediment core from a tropical saltmarsh to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on sediment accretion and carbon fluxes. Some geochemical indicators in a Pb-210 dated sediment core showed clear signals of marine influence. This was reflected on increased accretion rates, from 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1) in 1941 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 mm yr(-1) in 2012. These accretion rates were similar to eustatic sea level rise, and mean acceleration ranged from 0.037-0.22 mm yr(-2) implying a SLR by 2100 ranging from 14 to 86 cm. The one-century (1917-2013) organic carbon stock in sediments was calculated to be 10.1 +/- 0.2 Mg C ha(-1). During the same period, the organic carbon flux, corrected for organic carbon degradation, increased from 7 +/- 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to 73 +/- 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1), attributed to the impact of sea level rise in this ecosystem. This work shows that tropical saltmarshes may provide useful information on sea level rise, and the presented methodology may be used where instrumental records do not exist or they are too short.

TI  - ANNUAL MATERIAL PROCESSING BY A SALT-MARSH ESTUARINE-BASIN IN SOUTH-CAROLINA, USA
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthesis of a comprehensive annual study of material processing in the Bly Creek marsh-estuarine basin is described. The project design provides statistical estimates of material fluxes for the water column, salt marsh, and oyster reef subsystems. Fluxes from a freshwater stream, groundwater, and rain are also presented. Material processing by the Bly Creek marsh-estuarine basin is constituent- and subsystem-specific. Inflows of material via rain, streamwater, and groundwater are small and relatively unimportant compared to tidal fluxes. The salt marsh dominates the basin in aerial extent and in terms of net material fluxes. Most constituents exhibit significant net annual import to the salt marsh. Only DON is exported from the marsh and from the basin at significant levels. The salt marsh appears to recycle most of the nitrogen and phosphorus needed for marsh grass primary production. Sufficient inorganic particulate material is imported to allow the salt marsh to maintain its elevation with respect to ongoing sea-level rise. As a result of metabolic processes, the oyster reef imports particulate materials and releases dissolved nutrients. The reef is a significant consumer of chl a and produces enough dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to support water column primary production. The N:P ratio of Bly Creek dissolved inorganic nutrients is lower than that of North Inlet or ocean waters and implies nitrogen conservation or mobilization of particulate phosphorus into orthophosphate. In contrast to human-impacted coastal systems, this pristine basin reduces the N:P ratio as water passes through it. Differences in the N:P ratio are probably the result of DON export, denitrification, and phosphorus import by the basin.

T2  - Rastitel'nye Resursy
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative evaluation of morpho-structural features was conducted and the variability of biochemical characters was studied in variations of Pinus sylvestris L. that differed by the type of seed scale apophysis in cones, in pine shrub-sphagnum on marsh soils of the northern taiga. At the age of 60-70, the variant with convex seed scales apophysis (f. gibba Christ) prevailed over the variant with a flat apophysis (f. plana Christ) in the height of trunk and size of crown, as well as the length and weight of cone. The significant seasonal dynamics of chlorophylls and carotenoids, free proline and peroxidase activityin was revealed in the annual needles of these variations.

TI  - Self-organization of salt marsh patches on mudflats: Field evidence using the UAV technique
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt marsh system on the tidal flat is one of the most productively ecological wetlands with high biological productivity and blue carbon sequestration levels. The evolution of salt marshes-bare flats boundaries and the shapes of salt marsh margins are of scientific and engineering prospects due to the capability on indicating the morphodynamic patterns of tidal flats. Previous studies are almost qualitative, so far, quantitative analysis on this issue is scarce. To improve our understandings on the spatio-temporal characteristics of salt marsh margins and the mechanism underpinning, we extracted datasets on Spartina alterniflora using orthoimages derived from the quarterly-surveyed UAV photographs and satellite imagery. Results show that the patch-size distribution corresponded to the power law, indicating the marsh patches are in the state of self-organized criticality and the system is scale-independent. It was observed that the external dynamic conditions (i.e., the sediment erosion and accretion on the tidal flat) imposed negative impacts on the self-organization process. In particular, when the short-term morphological changes were negligible, R2 of the power-law relationship notably increased to nearly 1, indicating the salt marsh patches tended to adhere to a high-order self-organization structure in this process.

T2  - Polish Journal of Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes the results of field studies carried out in the period from April 2013 to May 2014. The study concerned the assessment of the magnitude of CO2 emissions from marsh soils in the area of Czerwone Bagno peat bog, which is a part of the largest complex of peatlands in Poland. The authors used the closed chamber method to measure seasonal variability of net ecosystem CO2 emission and drew attention to the impact of environmental factors(air temperature, air pressureandsoil moisture) on it. The highest values of average daily CO2 emission(over 630 mg(CO2) x m(-2) x h(-1)) were recorded in late spring and summer. Lowest values were obtained in late autumn and winter(in the range of 178-212 mg(CO2) x m(-2) x h(-1)). The need for monitoringof peat bogin temperate latitudes is stressed due to the progressive process of peat soilsdrying which enables the release of large quantities of greenhouse gases - CO2, CH4 - into the atmosphere.

TI  - Soil cellulase activity and fungal community responses to wetland degradation in the Zoige Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Four soil types (peat, marsh, meadow, and sandy) in the Zoige Plateau of China are associated with the severity of wetland degradation. The effects of wetland degradation on the structure and abundance of fungal communities and cellulase activity were assessed in these 4 soil types at 3 depths using DGGE (Denatured Gradient Gel Electrophoresis), qPCR (Quantitative Real-time PCR), and 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assays. Cellulase activity and abundance of the fungal community declined in parallel to the level of wetland degradation (from least to most disturbed). DGGE analysis indicated a major shift in composition of fungal communities among the 4 soil types consistent with the level of degradation. Water content (WC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), and available phosphorus (AP) were strongly correlated with cellulase activity and the structure and abundance of the fungal community. The results indicate that soil physicochemical properties (WC, OC, TN, TP, AN, and AP), cellulase activity, and diversity and abundance of fungal communities are sensitive indicators of the relative level of wetland degradation. WC was the major factor involved in Zoige wetland degradation and lower WC levels contributed to declines in the abundance and diversity of the fungal community and reduction in cellulase activity.

TI  - Data from: Seasonal dynamics and changing sea level as determinants of the community and trophic structure of oribatid mites in a salt marsh of the Wadden Sea
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Global change processes affect seasonal dynamics of salt marshes and      thereby their plant and animal communities. However, these changes have      been little investigated for microarthropod communities. We studied the      effect of seasonality and changes in sea level on oribatid mites in the      natural salt marsh and on artificial islands in the back-barrier      environment of the island Spiekeroog (Wadden Sea, Germany). Three zones of      the artificial islands were filled with transplanted sods from the lower      salt marsh zone and thereby exposed to three different inundation      frequencies. We hypothesized that oribatid mite communities will differ      along the natural salt marsh vegetation zones [upper salt marsh (USM),      lower salt marsh (LSM), pioneer zone (PZ)], which are influenced by      different tidal regimes. Accordingly, total oribatid mite densities      declined from the USM and LSM to the PZ. Similarly, oribatid mite species      compositions changed along the salt marsh transect and also responded to      variations in inundation frequency in LSM on artificial islands with      typical species of the USM, LSM and PZ being Multioppia neglecta (USM),      Hermannia pulchella (LSM), Zachvatkinibates quadrivertex (LSM, PZ) and      Ameronothrus schneideri (LSM, PZ). Oribatid mite density in the salt marsh      and on the artificial islands was at a maximum in winter and spring; this      was due in part to high density of juveniles, pointing to two reproductive      periods. We hypothesized that oribatid mite trophic structure changes due      to variations in abiotic (e.g., tidal dynamics, temperature) and biotic      conditions (e.g., resource availability). Stable isotope (15N, 13C) and      neutral lipid fatty acid analyses indicated that oribatid mite species      have different diets with e.g., Z. quadrivertex feeding on macroalgae and      fungi, A. schneideri feeding on microalgae and bacteria, and Scheloribates      laevigatus and M. neglecta feeding on dead organic matter, bacteria and      fungi. Overall, the results indicate that oribatid mite species in salt      marshes are affected by changes in environmental factors such as      inundation intensity, with the effects being most pronounced in species      with narrow trophic niches and limited niche plasticity. The results also      indicate that oribatid communities of the LSM respond little to short-term      (one year) changes in inundation frequency. fatty_acid_oribatid_mitesFatty acid data (NLFAs) of oribatid mites from      Spiekeroog,      GermanyMeanDensity_oribatid_mites_artificial_islandsMeanDensity_oribatid_mites_salt_marshstable_isotopes_oribatid_mites Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

TI  - Saline tidal flooding effects on Spartina densiflora plants from different positions of the salt marsh. Diversities and similarities on growth, anatomical and physiological responses
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina densiflora is a halophytic grass present in many salt marsh ecosystems where it dominates throughout topographical stress-gradients. This work aimed at studying diversities and similarities in ecophysiological responses of S. densiflora plants from two contrasting positions in the salt marsh. We simulated a natural tide by exposing plants of S. densiflora from upland and lowland sites of a salt marsh to saline intermittent flooding (9 h day(-1)) during 60 days. Responses in plant growth, biomass allocation, anatomy, ion regulation, and photosynthetic performance were assessed. Saline intermittent flooding caused changes in anatomical and morphological traits of plants from both sites associated with increased root aerenchyma and decreased mass allocation to leaf blades in relation to leaf sheaths, concomitant with reductions of blade size and changes in blade shape. Similar negative effects of saline intermittent flooding were found on physiological traits related to photosynthetic functioning of plants from both sites, like decreases in chlorophyll fluorescence, quantum efficiency and delta C-13. However, lowland plants presented unaffected leaf length, better ion regulation (higher Cl- exclusion, higher K+ concentration, and lower Na+/K+( ratio), as well as later leaf senescence with respect to upland plants, when subjected to saline intermittent flooding. Accordingly, plant biomass production decreased by 15% and 32% for lowland and upland plants, respectively. These results indicate that plants of S. densiflora inhabiting in the lowland positions have a better acclimation capacity to the harsh environment imposed by the tide than plants from the upland.

CP  - 103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting
CL  - Washington, DC, USA
AB  - Members of the Bacteroidetes are commonly known for their capacity to degrade complex organic matter including plant polymers. There are a number of marine strains within this phylum, but relatively few that have been isolated from salt marshes. The two strains described here were taken from salt marsh sediments along the Atlantic coast of Virginia. They were isolated from end dilution plates (10-5-10-6 dilutions) for aerobic heterotrophs and are part of a collection of 38 strains of Bacteroidetes that were collected from four different salt marsh sites at the same or different times. Both strains are short rods that were catalase and oxidase positive, and required NaCl to grow. Both strains reduced nitrate, but did not ferment; they have a limited number of single carbon sources they can utilize, including glucose, and cellobiose. G. salipaludis, strain BSD S2-05, was yellow pigmented with a temperature growth range of 10 to 37degreeC, and tolerated salt concentrations of up to 3%. The dominant fatty acids were 15:0 ISO, 15:0 ISO G, 15:0 ISO 3OH and 17:0 ISO 3OH. It did not contain flexirubins. The G+C content was 32.9%. Sequence analysis of its SSU rRNA gene indicated that it was 94% related to Gelidibacter algens. It was representative of a group of closely related strains that comprised 10 out of the 38 isolates of Bacteroidetes, suggesting this group is especially well adapted for growing in salt marsh sediments. C. virginiensis, strain BSB S2-03 is salmon-colored, has a temperature growth range of 4 to 42degreeC and tolerated salt concentrations of up to 7% NaCl. The dominant fatty acids were 15:0 ISO, 15:0 ISO 2OH, and 16:1 w7c. The G+C content was 34.6%, and it was 94.8% similar to Cyclobacterium sp. by comparison of 16S rDNA. This strain was not closely related to any of the other 38 isolates.

TI  - Groundwater denitrification capacity and nitrous oxide flux of former fringing salt marshes filled with human-transported materials
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - While former salt marsh sites filled with human transported material (HTM) have altered the surface marsh ecosystem, if artificial drainage is absent, subsurface conditions may continue favorable for denitrification, a microbial process reducing nitrogen (N) export to estuaries. We used piezometer networks to evaluate the in situ groundwater denitrification capacity and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux (with N-15-enriched nitrate-N via the push-pull method) in four former fringing salt marshes topped by HTM along the Rhode Island coast, U.S.A. Groundwater at these sites commonly interacted with the buried marsh horizon and the HTM. In situ groundwater denitrification capacity site means ranged from 15.2 to 71.7 mu g N kg(-1)d(-1) with no significant differences between sites due to high intrasite variability. The site with the highest and most consistent denitrification capacity also had HTM of the finest texture and highest soluble organic carbon. Three of four sites had minimal N2O flux [mean N2O:(N2O + N-2) = 0.082] while the final site had N2O generation rates up to 52.5 mu g N kg(-1) d(-1). The site with the highest N2O contributions also had the lowest ambient groundwater nitrate-N indicating lack of priming for N2O reduction to N-2. Former salt marshes with HTM deposits may still have the capacity for substantial groundwater denitrification capacity, similar to that observed in undisturbed salt marshes, but may also contribute substantially to global N2O emissions. For both salt marsh restoration and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, attention should be given to ensuring that a tidally-driven, fluctuating water table regularly intercepts the buried organic horizons of the filled salt marsh.

TI  - Macrophyte assemblages in ditches of coastal marshes in relation to land-use, salinity and water quality
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical land claim of coastal salt marshes in eastern England resulted in the development of grazing marshes, many of which were Subsequently converted to arable fanning. Their ditches support a rich variety of macrophyte species, due to subtle changes in water chemistry and hydroperiod. Macrophytes were surveyed in 36 shallow freshwater/brackish marsh ditches in eastern England during spring/summer 2000 to determine the relationships between environmental factors, agricultural activities (grazing or arable land use), and macrophyte diversity. Pasture site ditches supported a higher number of species (21) than arable ditches (8). Principle Components Analysis (PCA) for environmental variables associated pasture ditches with higher sediment ash-free dry weight (AFDW) and lower orthophosphate concentration and salinity. TWINSPAN classification grouped the submerged species Callitriche stagnalis, Ceratophyllum demersum, Ranunculus peltatus, R. aquatilis, Myriophyllum spicatum, and Potamogeton crispus into pasture ditch sites while the emergent species Phragmites australis and Scirpus maritimus were dominant in arable ditches. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) for all environmental variables analyzed showed that macrophyte distribution was strongly related to salinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and sediment AFDW, which differed between pasture and arable sites. Increases in salinity and decreases ill AFDW were associated with decreasing species richness (e.g. submerged and floating species). The growth of two submerged macrophytes (C. demersum and C. stagnalis) was studied in transplant experiments over three months in ditches at opposite ends of the TWINSPAN classification. In pasture ditches both species showed significant net biomass increment, whereas in arable ditches plants had significantly lower growth rates, with reduced biomass in some ditches. Macrophyte net biomass was predicted by a combination of salinity, water depth and water Column Chl-a. Experimentally, salinity above 3 ppt significantly reduced the net growth of C. stagnalis, although C. demersum grew in salinities up to 5 ppt, above which leaf damage and necrosis occurred. Salinity up to 6 ppt was detected in at-able ditches and was highly negatively correlated with water depth. Results suggest that ditches flora is affected in various ways based on surrounding land use. Salinity control by increased freshwater input and reduction of nutrient load are important factors in maintaining diversity of macrophyte assemblages.

TI  - Methane dynamics in an estuarine brackish Cyperus malaccensis marsh: Production and porewater concentration in soils, and net emissions to the atmosphere over five years
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands can potentially affect global climate change through their role in modulating the atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4). Their overall CH4 emissions, however, remain the greatest uncertainty in the global CH4 budget. One reason for this is the paucity of long-term field measurements to characterize the variability of CH4 emissions from different types of wetlands. In this study, we quantified CH4 emissions from a brackish, oligohaline Cyperus malaccensis marsh ecosystem in the Min River Estuary in southeast China over five years. Our results showed substantial temporal variability of CH4 emissions from this brackish marsh, with hourly fluxes ranging from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 3.7 mg m(-2) h(-1) (mean +/- 1 SD) during the study period. The inter-annual variability of CH4 emissions was significantly correlated with changes in soil temperature, precipitation and salinity, which highlighted the importance of long-term observations in understanding wetland CH4 dynamics. Distinct seasonal patterns in soil CH4 production rates and porewater CH4 concentrations also were observed, and were both positively correlated with CH4 emissions. The seasonal variations of CH4 emissions and production were highly correlated with salinity and porewater sulfate levels. The mean annual CH4 efflux from our site over the five-year period was 23.8 +/- 18.1 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that subtropical brackish tidal marsh ecosystems could release a large amount of CH4 into the atmosphere. Our findings further highlight the need to obtain high-frequency and continuous field measurements over the long term at multiple spatial scales to improve our current estimates of wetland CH4 emissions.

TI  - Long-term effect of crude oil and dispersant on denitrification and organic matter mineralization in a salt marsh sediment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2010 BP oil spill has an unprecedented impact on coastal wetland ecosystem along the northern Gulf of Mexico. A two-dimensional analysis (dispersant concentration and duration of exposure) was conducted by pre-incubation of a salt marsh sediment under an open or closed condition. Denitrification activity was characterized by N2O production using an acetylene (C2H2) blockage technique, and organic matter (OM) mineralization by CO2 production. The results show that even trace amount of the dispersant could significantly inhibit the denitrification activity by 20% (p <0.05). However, the sediment was resilient to the oil/dispersant contamination, likely due to shift of its microbial communities, by recovering the denitrification activity within 46 days in the open incubation. Inhibitory effect of the oil/dispersant on denitrification persisted beyond 46 days in the closed incubation, and the recovery could take up to 137 days depending on the dispersant concentration. The dispersant continuously stimulated OM mineralization that lowered the sediment redox status. Mobilization of N in the sediment from the OM mineralization forms a positive feedback loop, leading to deterioration of the coastal ecosystem. The study concludes that minimum dispersant should be applied for oil spill remediation, and oil cleanup operations should avoid moving the oil/dispersant from surface into deeper layers of the sediment. Synergistic interactions between the crude oil and dispersant and their biodegradation products deserves future examinations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geochemical processes controlling the distribution and concentration of metals in soils from a Patagonian (Argentina) salt marsh affected by mining residues
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal pollution that affects salt marshes is a major environmental concern due to its toxic nature, persistence, and potential risk to organisms and to human health. Mining waste deposits originated four decades ago, by the metallurgical extraction of heavy metals, are found near to the San Antonio salt marsh in Patagonia. The aim of the work was to determine the geochemical processes that control the distribution and concentration of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the soils of this Patagonian salt marsh. A survey of themining waste deposits was carried outwhere three dumpswere identified. Samples were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter and metal contents and the soil mineralogical composition. The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit. Finally, the heavymetal pollutants recorded in the San Antonio saltmarsh shows that the mining waste deposits that were abandoned four decades ago are still a source metal contamination.

TI  - Functional and structural trajectory (FAST) model to predict wetland ecosystem development: A case study using constructed salt marshes
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS OF NUTRIENTS IN NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Nutrient Cycling and Retention in Natural and Constructed Wetlands III
CL  - TREBON, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - A Functional and Structural Trajectory (FAST) model is presented that predicts the evolution of wetland structure and function during salt marsh ecosystem development. The FAST model is tested by comparing structural and functional attributes of marsh producers (Spartina), consumers (benthic invertebrates) and nutrient cycles (C, N, P) along a chronosequence of 1 to 28 year-old constructed Spartina alterniflora a marshes with paired older reference (natural) marshes. Salt marsh structure and function followed two inherently different trajectories during ecosystem development. Functional attributes, like Spartina biomass, invertebrate density and carbon and nutrient accumulation, exceeded 100% equivalence before decreasing to levels found in reference marshes. In contrast, structural attributes like Spartina stem density and height, invertebrate species richness and soil carbon and nutrient pools gradually converged to equivalence without ever exceeding levels in reference marshes. Our trajectories also revealed that different components of the restored salt marsh ecosystem developed at different rates. Both Spartina structure and function achieved equivalence to reference wetlands within 10-15 years following establishment. Development of invertebrate structure and function required 15-20 years. Soil C and nutrient accumulation occurred almost instantaneously with colonization by Spartina. However, after 28 years, soil C and N pools were considerably less than in reference marshes. Our FAST model demonstrates that trajectories can be developed and used to predict the evolution of salt marsh structure and function during wetland ecosystem development. The model should be tested using similar ecosystems in different geographic regions and in other detritus based ecosystems to evaluate its predictive power and robustness.

TI  - Wetland Soil Properties and Resident Bacterial Communities Are Influenced by Changes in Elevation
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils from four sites distributed along an elevation gradient from marsh to coastal forest in a wetland bordering the Gulf of Mexico were sampled over a 16-months period. In addition to measuring a suite of environmental conditions, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of the resident bacterial communities were performed. Wetland soil bacterial communities varied across both space and time, with all measured variables (temperature, pH, percentage of soil organic matter, salinity, and concentrations of sulfide, NH4+, NO3-, and soluble reactive phosphorus) showing significant site by time interactions. Analyses of bacterial communities showed both marsh zones (Spartina and Cladium) supported similar communities, as did the ecotone and coastal forest. Bacterial communities within coastal forest soils were significantly different than those within marsh soils, and the ecotone communities were significantly different from the Spartina marsh soil. Temperature and pH were the most influential environmental factors impacting bacterial community composition but no predictable patterns were identified, suggesting that community changes are likely the result of intrinsic factors that are affected by local-scale processes. The dynamic nature of the physiochemical variables within wetlands suggests that more work is needed to determine potential interactive effects on bacterial community structure.

TI  - Effects of salt marsh vegetation zonation on carbon and nitrogen cycling in Connecticut
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal marshes fringing the Long Island Sound (Connecticut, USA) are dynamic ecosystems positioned at the interface between land and sea, and provide an array of essential ecosystem services to society associated with improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and disturbance regulation. However, these wetlands are increasingly altered by rising seas and invasive species, and have been affected by historical managementsuch as tidal manipulation.We conducted a survey of 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 tidally restored, 10 unrestricted references) in 2017 to quantify carbon mineralization, denitrification potential, microbial community composition, above and belowground biomass and a suite of sediment characteristics. Carbon density was our only paramenter thatdiffered between unrestricted and tidally restored marshes, but we observed strong differences across vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of microbial respiration and potential denitrification rates. Based on sea-level rise model projections, the replacement of S. patens by short-form S. alterniflora is expected to be widespread across the Connecticut coastline, decreasing statewide potential denitrification from the low-to-high marsh transitional zone. Our results suggest that changes in vegetation zones can serve as landscape-scale predictors of the rapid changes occurring in salt marshes. We sampled 20 polyhaline salt marshes (10 reference marshes with no history of restriction or restoration (i.e., "reference sites"), 10 tidally restored)along the north shore of the Long Island Sound in Connecticut (CT), USA. Sites were selected based on their restoration history and presence of target vegetation: Spartinaalterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phagmitesaustralis.Within each vegetation zone at each site, we sampled three 1-m2 plotsin mid-August 2017. We visually estimated percent cover of all plants in each plot.From each plot we collected aboveground biomass (from a randomly selected 25 x 25 cm subplot) and three surface soil cores (5-cm diameter to 10-cm depth; 196-cm3 volume); sampleswere composited by zone and used to estimate above and belowground biomass (C and N content),bulk density, microbial process rates (denitrification potential, carbon mineralization, substrate induced respiration)and a suite of soil chemistry parameters using standarized methods (soil pH and specific electrical conductivity, soil moisture, total C and N, soil organic matter, carbon density,and soil SO42-, Cl-, NH4+ concentrations).

TI  - Sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along the Andong salt marsh, Hangzhou Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lignin oxidation products, delta C-13 values, C/N ratios and particle size were used to investigate the sources, distribution and chemical stability of sedimentary organic matter (OM) along the Andong salt marsh located in the southwestern end of Hangzhou Bay, China. Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts have destroyed many salt marshes and mangroves world-wide, and now they must be rebuilt to restore their valuable ecosystem services. Laboratory mesocosms provide important information on impacts from sea-level rise, climate change, pollution and biological invasions. We illustrate these principles using examples from Chezzetcook Estuary, a boreal mesotidal wetland in northeastern Canada. This estuary is the location of classical paleoecology studies using foraminifera, testate amoebae and pollen to reconstruct sea level changes to +/- 1 cm precision and to determine natural versus anthropogenic pollution effects. We have developed a replicable laboratory mesocosm system to examine various responses under controlled conditions at all seasons. This mesocosm experiment provides the first high-resolution data on population dynamics and compositions of foraminifera in conjunction with the meiofauna (nematodes, ostracods, copepods) coexisting in the tidal marsh sediments. We are also beginning to use stable isotopes to understand the specific trophic roles of foraminifera and the meiofauna that comprise most of the small food-web in the highly productive salt marsh ecosystem. These studies, combined with palynological and geochemical records of human impacts, are important for managing salt marsh systems and for interpreting foraminiferal records of paleo-sea level and paleoclimate change. We also report on new studies of surface sediments from the boreal microtidal wetlands of the Danube Delta and adjacent continental shelf. Initial results reveal 20 phytoplankton taxa and > 50 zooplankton or benthic meiofauna with organic remains that mark the pathways of particulate organic carbon to the delta plain and nearshore. In 2013, the amounts of freshwater algal spores and dinocysts in the surface layer did not indicate strong eutrophication in the river channel, Razim Lake and plume environments; however, they show a potential for Gloeotrichia blooms nearshore, and outbreaks of Botryococcus on the prodelta front. Dinocysts in prodelta sediments could also be seeded into the Danube lakes by storm waves and cause serious damage where summer water salinity is above 9. We recommend EU partnership to study sediment cores that record changes in the Delta paleosalinity, plankton and meiofaunal populations since Roman occupation time. More global collaboration efforts is required to reduce wasted time, energy and finances on overlapping 'trial-and-error' experiments and evaluators of success. There is also need for exchange of microfossil and palynological data to standardize laboratory methods and taxonomy.

TI  - Modelling blue carbon farming opportunities at different spatial scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000-16,300 ha), and local (335-370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional similar to 800,000 tonnes of CO(2)e by 2045 (potentially generating AU$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO(2)e ha(-1) by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) in a tidal estuary
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrations of dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) were measured in an estuarine tidal creek in North Inlet (South Carolina) during June and August 2007. There was a predictable pattern of dAPS concentrations in Crab Haul Creek, with the highest concentrations of dAPS occurring at low tide (2490 +/- 300 mu g L(-1) [mean +/- SD] as gum xanthan equivalents). Suspended sediment load positively correlated with dAPS concentrations during a 12-h survey over a complete tidal cycle at a single location. There was a significant correlation between chlorophyll a and dAPS in the upper 5 mm of intertidal salt marsh sediments. High dAPS concentrations (3170-7820 mg m(2)) in emersed intertidal sediment at low tide compared with depth-integrated water-column dAPS (100-370 mg m(2)) indicate that the sediment was potentially the major source of dAPS to the water column. Total dAPS in the water column overlying the 1.1-km(2) area of Crab Haul Creek basin varied between 10967 to 4066 225 kg (mean +/- SD) as gum xanthan equivalents over a tidal cycle. Conservative estimate of dAPS export from North Inlet to the Atlantic Ocean as organic carbon was 5.00 x 10(8) g C during the summer, or 1.32 x 10(9) g C annually. The spatiotemporal distributions of dAPS indicate that they are a significant pool of organic carbon in estuaries.

TI  - Mercury accumulation in surface sediments of salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury contamination in Canada's Bay of Fundy is a priority concern because of elevated levels observed in fish, birds and wildlife. Salt marshes constitute an important part of the Bay's coastline and are potential stores of mercury for the region. We measured the amount of mercury accumulated over a 5-yr period from 1997 to 2002 in surface sediments of seven salt marshes along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay. The seven study sites extended from outer to inner Bay, spanning a gradient in tidal range (6-12 m) and sediment characteristics such as %LOI (4-29%) and sediment deposition rate (0.27-1.76 cm yr(-1)). In each study site, mercury was measured in low and high marsh areas. Sediment mercury concentrations ranged from 7 to 79 ng g(-1) and loading rates ranged from 0.1 to 1 mg m(-2). Total estimated 5-yr storage of mercury in salt marsh sediments of the Bay is 854 +/- 465 kg. We also compared sediment mercury loading to atmospheric inputs measured at a deposition monitoring station operating in New Brunswick from 1997 to 2002 and found that direct atmospheric deposition appears to be a minor input of mercury to these sediments. We are unaware of documentation of mercury loading in salt marshes on a bay-wide scale and over a constrained (5-yr) time period elsewhere. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasion drastically increases methane production potential by shifting methanogenesis from hydrogenotrophic to methylotrophic pathway in a coastal marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion can strongly influence carbon (C) cycling processes, thus it may affect climate change by altering C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in the invaded ecosystem. Since 1979, the exotic Spartina alterniflora has rapidly expanded in China's coastal areas, where significant increase in methane (CH4) emissions has been documented from post-invaded sites. However, a mechanistic understanding of the structural and functional changes of associated methanogens accompanying this invasion remains elusive.Here we conducted integrated biogeochemical investigations on methanogenic substrates, activity, and diversity to identify implications of S. alterniflora invasion for methanogenesis in coastal wetlands. To do this, we collected and analysed 0-50cm soil profiles from an uncolonised tidal flat (TF) and salt marshes that S. alterniflora has invaded for 1year (SA-1) and 12years (SA-12) in Jiangsu, China. Methanogenic community composition was characterised by massive parallel sequencing. The rates and pathways of methanogenesis were determined by adding trace concentrations of C-13-labelled substrates to anaerobic incubated samples.Our results revealed that 12-year invasion of S.alterniflora drastically increased CH4 production potential by one order of magnitude over that of TF. This substantial increase was primarily attributed to methanogenesis from trimethylamine; its rates increased by two orders of magnitude over TF whereas those from acetate and H-2/CO2 increased far less. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway operating in the TF, but methanotrophic pathway contributed most to CH4 production in the surface layer of SA-1 and uppermost 40-cm layers of SA-12. Consistent with these observations, the dominant methanogens shifted from obligate hydrogenotrophic Methanococcales in TF to potential methylamine-utilising Methanosarcinaceaein SA-12. Our Mantel analysis indicated that non-competitive' trimethylamine, derived from cytoplasmic osmolytes of S. alterniflora, was the major driver of this change in methanogenic community composition.Synthesis. Our results suggest that invasive Spartina alternifloraplants gradually facilitated the local dominance of methylotrophic Methanosarcinaceae by changing the key type of methanogenic substrate in coastal marshes. Shifts in methanogen communities and enhanced availability of trimethylamine elevated the rates and importance of methylotrophic methanogenesis, thereby markedly increasing CH4 production potential and emission rates in this type of ecosystem.

TI  - Sea-level rise enhances carbon accumulation in United States tidal wetlands
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands accumulate soil carbon more efficiently than terrestrial systems, but sea-level rise potentially threatens the persistence of this prominent carbon sink. Here, we combine a published dataset of 372 soil carbon accumulation rates from across the United States with new analysis of 131 sites in coastal Louisiana and find that the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) explains 80% of regional variation in carbon accumulation. A carbon mass balance for the rapidly submerging Louisiana coast demonstrates that carbon accumulation rates in surviving marshes increase with RSLR and currently exceed the rate of carbon loss due to marsh drowning and erosion. Although continued erosion will eventually lead to net carbon loss, our results suggest a strong negative carbon-climate feedback for coastal marshes, where even submerging marshes sequester carbon at rates that increase with RSLR.

TI  - Productivity and nutrient cycling in salt marshes: Contribution to ecosystem health
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the contribution of different salt marsh halophytes (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus, Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia fruticosa, and Sarcocornia perennis) to nutrient cycling and sequestration in warm-temperate salt marshes. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in plant organs and rhizosediment, as well as plant biomass were monitored every two months during one year. Results show that the C retained in the rhizosediment does not seem to be species or site specific. However, some halophytes seem to have a higher contribution to retain C from external sources, namely S. perennis and S. maritima. Regarding N, halophytes colonizing the upper and middle marsh areas had the highest NBPP (net belowground primary production) as well as the retention of N in the rhizosediment. Yet, excluding S. maritimus, all halophytes seem to contribute to the retention of N from external sources. The P retained in the rhizosediment does not seem to be species or site specific. Still, only S. maritima colonizing the lower marsh areas, which also had comparatively lower NBPP, seem to have a higher contribution to retain P from external sources. Additionally, it seems that there is no relation between plants sequestration capacity for nutrients and plant photosynthetic pathway. This work shows that nutrient cycling and accumulation processes by salt marsh halophytes contribute to reduce eutrophication (N and P retention) and also to reduce atmospheric CO2 (C retention), highlighting salt marsh ecosystems services and the crucial role of halophytes in maintaining ecosystem functions and health.

TI  - Lessons from the past: isotopes of an endangered rail as indicators of underlying change to tidal marsh habitats
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Tidal marsh systems along the Pacific coast of the United States have experienced substantial stress and loss of area and ecosystem function, which we examined by using the endangered California Ridgway's Rail, Rallus obsoletus obsoletus ('rail') as an indicator of its tidal marsh habitat in the San Francisco Estuary. We organized a collection of historical (1885-1940) and modern (2005-2014) rail feathers and analyzed the feather isotope means for delta carbon (delta C-13), sulfur (delta S-34), and nitrogen (delta N-15) by region and time period.Outcomes: Feather isotopes represented the primary foraging habitat during historical then modern time periods. Neither individual nor regional rail feather isotopes suggested freshwater or terrestrial foraging by the rail. Three regions with both historic and modern feather isotopes revealed non-uniform spatial shifts in isotope levels consistent with a marine based food web and significant delta N-15 enrichment.Discussion: Our results supported the rail's status as a generalist forager and obligate tidal marsh species throughout the historic record. The variable isoscape trends generated from feather isotope means illustrated a modern loss of the isotopic homogeneity between regions of historical tidal marsh, which correlated with spatially-explicit habitat alterations such as increasing biological invasions and sewage effluent over time.Conclusion: These findings have reinforced the importance of tidal marsh conservation in the face of ongoing underlying changes to these important ecosystems.

T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and organic carbon density (OCD) is an active indicator of soil fertility and productivity, and it ﬂuctuates spatially and temporally. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the spa- tial variability of SOC and OCD using geostatistics model as well as ﬁeld methods at Sagar Island (Sundarban), India.Soil samples at the depths of 0–20 cm were collected from twenty plots at different season to estimate organic carbon concentrations and carbon density in the laboratory. Spatial distributions of SOC and OCD concentrations were esti- mated using ordinary kriging method. Remote sensing imagery and ground truth helped in identifying different features as well as land use/land cover correctly. Landuse are characterized by coastal water, sand, coastal wetland, salt marsh, agricultural fallow land, sparse vegetation, crop/paddy ﬁeld, and mixed settlement area. The average value SOC were recorded as 2.80, 1.83, and 2.069 % in post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon season respec- tively. Semivariograms models of SOC and OCD in all seasons illustrated strong positive nugget values indicated short scale variability and sampling error. The coefﬁcient of determination (R2 ) of the SOC model denoted as 0.71, 0.68 and 0.74 and for OCD calculated as 0.78, 0.67 and 0.83 at pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon season respectively. The results illustrated that mangrove forest portrayed highest amount of SOC concentration in both the pre-monsoon (1.05 kg/m2 ) and post-monsoon (0.94 kg/m2 ) season.

TI  - Fluorescence characterization and microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter leached from salt marsh plants in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Salt marsh vegetation is an important contributor of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to coastal waters. The dynamics of DOM leaching from different marsh plants, however, have not been well studied or compared.Methods In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the processes of DOM leaching from three common marsh plants (Phragrnites australis, Suaeda salsa and Aeluropus littoralis) collected from the Yellow River Delta (YRD) salt marsh in October 2016. The YRD is one of the largest and most well-protected coastal ecosystems on the east coast of China.Important Findings We found that the plant leaves released DOM at much higher concentrations than the plant roots or stems, as measured by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN). On average, 15% of the biomass C and 30% of the biomass N were released from the plant leaves as DOC and DN during the 27-day incubation period. The DOM released from the plants was very labile, and 92A%-98.1% of the DOC arid 88.0%-94.6% of the DN released from the plants were consumed by bacteria during the 27-day incubation period. The fluorescence characteristics of the plant-released DOM indicated that chromophoric dissolved organic matter was a major fraction of the DOM and that protein-like components were the primary organic fractions released from the plants. Bacterial degradation altered both the fluorescence properties and the chemical composition of the DOM. The results of the laboratory experiments were well supported by the field investigation, which indicated that a large amount of DOM was outwelled from the YRD salt marshes in late autumn. Our study suggests that the DOM released from the biomass of salt marsh plants provides an important source of both DOC and DN for marsh and coastal waters. The highly labile DOC and DN provide essential food sources to support microbial communities in the YRD salt marsh and adjacent coastal waters.

TI  - The Declining Role of Organic Matter in New England Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northeast USA is experiencing severe impacts of a changing climate, including increased winter temperatures and accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). The sediment-poor, organic-rich nature of many Southern New England salt marshes makes them particularly vulnerable to these changes. In order to assess how marsh accretion has changed over time, we returned to Narragansett Bay, RI where salt marsh vertical accretion rates were documented almost 30 years ago. Using radionuclide tracers (Pb-210 and Cs-137), we observe no significant change in overall accretion rates (0.27-0.69 cm year(-1)) compared to historical averages (0.24-0.60 cm year(-1)), but we document a shift in how these marshes maintain elevation. Organic matter now plays a smaller role in contributing to vertical accretion across all study sites, declining by 22 % on average. We attribute this reduction to potentially higher decomposition rates fueled by higher water temperature. Inorganic matter also contributes less to accretion (declining by 44 % on average at marshes located more internal to the estuary), likely due to diminishing sediment supply in this region. With organic and inorganic solids accounting for less of the total accretion, several of the marshes are experiencing symptoms of swelling, with water and porespace contributing more towards accretion compared to historical values. Accretion rates (0.27-0.45 cm year(-1)) at these organic-rich (> 40 % sediment organic matter) marshes are predominantly lower than the current (30 years) rate of RSLR (0.41 +/- 0.07 cm year(-1)). These results, combined with the increased rate of RSLR and the hardened shorelines inhibiting landward migration, call into question the long-term survivability of these marshes.

TI  - Response of biogeochemical indicators to a drawdown and subsequent reflood
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal oscillations in hydrology are a common occurrence in wetlands and can result in alternating flooded and drained conditions in the surface soil. These oscillations in water levels can stimulate microbial activities and result in the mobilization and redistribution of significant amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). The goal of this study was to experimentally simulate a drawdown and reflood of marsh soil from a nutrient-enriched site and a reference site of a wetland (Blue Cypress Marsh Conservation Area, Florida). The goal was to better understand the changes in biogeochemistry and microbial activities present in these soils as a result of hydrological fluctuations. Measurements of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), ammonia, and nitrate in the floodwater indicated significantly higher (alpha = 0.05) NH4+ and DRP fluxes from the nutrient-enriched site; floodwaters in the cores from both sites contained significant NO3- concentrations (9.6 mg N L-1), which was rapidly consumed over the core incubation period (30 it). Water level drawdown and reflooding initially stimulated the soil microbial biomass, methanogenic rates, and extracellular enzyme activities (acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase). The anaerobic microbial metabolic activities (CO2) where initially significantly (a = 0.05) enhanced by the reflood, resulting in roughly equivalent rates as the aerobic respiratory activities (CO2), presumably as a function of the high water column NO3- levels. This study illustrates that the reflood event in the hydrological cycles in a wetland can significantly stimulate the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and microbiological communities in these soils.

TI  - Fate and effects of nutrients and heavy metals in experimental salt marsh ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fate and effects of the macro nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and the heavy metals zinc, copper and cadmium, brought into experimental salt marsh ecosystems via sediment supply, were studied over a three-year period.The supply of sediment from the Marsdiep (at a low and high rate) and from the harbour of Delfzijl (at a high rate) led to an increase of the macro nutrients and heavy metals in the top soil. The growth of the salt marsh plants Aster tripolium, Puccinellia maritima and Spartina anglica and the uptake of the macro nutrients and heavy, metals by the plants was only slightly affected by the addition of sediment. A high load of sediment led to an increase in growth or in the concentrations of the macro nutrients or heavy metals iii the plants at a number of sampling dates, but only minor differences between treatments were found.From a mass balance constructed over a three-year study period it could be concluded that about 50% of the macro nutrients and heavy metals were retained in the salt marsh sediment. This was equal to the retained amount of organic matter, indicating that retention of the elements was closely related to retention of organic matter. The 50% loss of the macro nutrients and heavy metals probably occurred via ebb tides after resuspension of sediment and organic matter. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are widely distributed in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia with their own distinct vegetation. The objective of this study were to study the effect of soil properties on characteristics of Halopeplis perfoliata community and plant response to environmental conditions of the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. The study area is located at five sites: Ras Tanura, Syhat, Dammam, Al-Uqair and Salwah of the Arabian Gulf Coastal salt marshes in eastern province of Saudi Arabia where the plants grows under the natural environmental condition. Plant samples and soil of H. perfoliata succulent (halophyte) collected from the five sites. Several soil concentrations were determined such as electric conductivity (EC), organic carbon (O.C.), Na+, Cl-, So(4), K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The highest concentrations of the ions of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in soil samples were found in Dammam site compared with the other sites, where Cl is the major ion followed by Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+. The involvement of photosynthetic pigments, and proline investigated. Values of TWC and RWC and photosynthetic pigment fractions content (chl. a, chl. b and carotenoids) from the plants obtained from Dammam were higher. In this study proline contents increased significantly in the leaves of H. perfoliata as the salt concentration increased. A total of 57 plants species were identified in all the five study site. The life forms of the studied plant spices exhibit a wide variation, perennial shrub (PSH) were the dominate growth form (63.16 %). This research suggests that H. perfoliata could remove salt from soil.

TI  - Effects of Spartina Wrack on Surface-Active Arthropod Assemblage Under Different Environmental Contexts in Southwest Atlantic Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of tidally accumulated detritus (i.e., wrack) are an important source of disturbance affecting different abiotic and biotic characteristics in salt marshes, which could in turn affect the macrofauna assemblage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the effect of a simulated oil spill and its control by means of application of a remediator on the physical and chemical characteristics of a savanna Ultisol soil. Each bag contained 1 kilogram of soil, which was contaminated in an artificial way (20% w/w). After the contamination, the remediator was applied to soil, adding 50 grams. 500 kilograms of 12-24-12/ha was applied. Soil from control; soil contaminated by oil without the remediator and soil contaminated by oil with the remediator were analyzed. The pH, contents of organic matter, magnesium and calcium were similar in the three soils while the clay percentage, aluminum and hydrogen contents were bigger in virgin soil. Contents of phosphorus, potassium, manganese, zinc, copper and iron were smaller in the virgin soil in comparison with the soil with oil and the soil with oil plus remediator.

TI  - Accelerated microbial organic matter mineralization following salt-water intrusion into tidal freshwater marsh soils
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of salt-water intrusion on microbial organic carbon (C) mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) soils was investigated in a year-long laboratory experiment in which intact soils were exposed to a simulated tidal cycle of freshwater or dilute salt-water. Gas fluxes [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)], rates of microbial processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis), and porewater and solid phase biogeochemistry were measured throughout the experiment. Flux rates of CO2 and, surprisingly, CH4 increased significantly following salt-water intrusion, and remained elevated relative to freshwater cores for 6 and 5 months, respectively. Following salt-water intrusion, rates of sulfate reduction increased significantly and remained higher than rates in the freshwater controls throughout the experiment. Rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were higher than rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but the rates did not differ by salinity treatment. Soil organic C content decreased significantly in soils experiencing salt-water intrusion. Estimates of total organic C mineralized in freshwater and salt-water amended soils over the 1-year experiment using gas flux measurements (18.2 and 24.9 mol C m(-2), respectively) were similar to estimates obtained from microbial rates (37.8 and 56.2 mol C m(-2), respectively), and to losses in soil organic C content (0 and 44.1 mol C m(-2), respectively). These findings indicate that salt-water intrusion stimulates microbial decomposition, accelerates the loss of organic C from TFM soils, and may put TFMs at risk of permanent inundation.

TI  - Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion increases CH4 while reduces CO2 emissions from mangrove wetland soils in southeastern China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are critical in global carbon budget while vulnerable to exotic plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora, one of typical salt marsh plant grows forcefully along the coast of China, has invaded the native mangrove habitats in Zhangjiang Estuary. However, the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on soil carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission from mangroves are not fully understood. Accordingly, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the soil CH4 and CO2 emission during growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 at four adjacent wetlands, namely bare mudflat (Mud), Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM) and S. alterniflora (SA). Potential methane production (PMP), potential methane oxidation (PMO), functional microbial abundance and soil biogeochemical properties were measured simultaneously. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion could dramatically increase soil CH4 emissions mainly due to the enhancement in PMP which facilitated by soil EC, MBC, TOC and mcrA gene abundance. Additionally, S. alterniflora invasion decreases soil CO2 emission. Both heterotrophic microbial respiration (165 rRNA) and methane oxidation (pmoA and ANME-pmoA) are responsible for CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, S. alterniflora invasion greatly increases GWP by stimulating CH4 emissions. Thus, comparing with mangroves, invasive S. alterniflora significantly (p < 0.001) increases CH4 emission while reduces CO2 emission.

TI  - Changes in delta N-15 in salt marsh sediments in a long-term fertilization study
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen retention by salt marshes has been suggested as a means of mitigating the delivery of land-derived nitrogen loads to coastal waters. As land-derived nitrogen loads increase, it is unclear whether there is an upper limit to the amount of nitrogen retained by salt marshes. A long-term fertilization study in the Great Sippewissett Marsh on Cape Cod, USA, has been examining the changes to salt marsh vegetation and sediment processes as a result of increased nitrogen loading. To determine whether decadal-scale changes in nitrogen loading and sources are recorded in salt marsh sediments, we examined sediment delta N-15 and % N profiles from below low and high marsh vegetation in control and fertilized plots in Great Sippewissett Marsh. As expected, we found little change in delta N-15 values in control plots. Nitrogen burial, calculated using % N values in bulk sediments, was higher in fertilized plots, but did not increase over time. However, delta N-15 values in fertilized plots were higher than in control plots and increased over time, becoming heavier than the source fertilizer and continuing to increase linearly. The continuous increase in sediment delta N-15 values in fertilized plots over the fertilizer delta N-15 value suggests that de nitrifying bacteria are responding to the increased nitrogen load and fractionating the available nitrogen. The nitrogen that remained unaccounted for by burial led us to conclude that 47 to 80% of the fertilizer nitrogen was denitrified.

TI  - Stable carbon isotopes as potential sea-level indicators in salt marshes, North Carolina, USA
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the use of delta C-13 values and C:N ratios from salt-marsh sediments to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL) with an established approach using foraminifera. Analysis of bulk-organic sediment and plant samples collected along transects at two sites in North Carolina, USA demonstrates that sediment delta C-13 values can be used to distinguish between Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh (C photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -17.6 parts per thousand to 16.1 parts per thousand) and Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh (C-3 photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -28.2 parts per thousand to -21.8 parts per thousand) environments. Juncus roemerianus plants undergo little decompositional change in delta C-13 (average 0.8 parts per thousand), although there is a clear difference between Spartina alterniflora tissue and bulk-organic sediments (approximately 4 parts per thousand). C:N ratios on bulk-organic sediment from freshwater upland and salt-marsh environments converge during early diagenesis, rendering them of little use in reconstructing RSL. The utility of delta C-13 values as a sea-level indicator is limited by the elevational range of C-4 plants, making it difficult to recognize salt-marsh subenvironments and improve the precision of RSL reconstructions. Furthermore, Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh and freshwater upland sediments cannot be adequately distinguished with delta C-13 values.

TI  - Nutrients and zooplankton composition and dynamics in relation to the hydrological pattern in a confined Mediterranean salt marsh (NE Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of the hydrological regime in the nutrients and zooplankton composition and dynamics has been analysed in five lagoons of La Pletera salt marshes (NE Iberian Peninsula) during a complete hydrological cycle (2002-2003). Two of the lagoons have their origin in the old river mouths while the other three were recently created in the framework of a Life Restoration project. This fact has also allowed us to study the effect of the lagoon age on nutrient and zooplankton composition and dynamics. The salt marsh hydrology is determined by a prolonged period of confinement without water inputs, irregularly interrupted by sudden water inputs due to flooding events (sea storms or intense rain-falls). While the dynamics of oxidized nitrogen compounds in the lagoons depends on the water inputs variability within each hydrological cycle, the internal load of phosphorus, total nitrogen and organic matter is related more to the cumulative mechanisms during the confinement periods. Accumulation processes may be easily related to lagoon age, since old lagoons have higher content of nutrients and organic matter, suggesting that these lagoons progressively accumulate nutrients during the successive confinement events. This is the usual case for most Mediterranean salt marshes without an artificially manipulated water regime. The zooplankton community in La Pletera integrates the effects of both the hydrological regime and the lagoon age since the former determines the temporal pattern of the main zooplankton species and the latter explains differences in composition and structure between old and new lagoons.

TI  - Palatability and Chemical Defense of Phragmites australis to the Marsh Periwinkle Snail Littoraria irrorata
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marsh habitats are impacted by many disturbances, including habitat destruction, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species. The common reed, Phragmites australis, has been particularly invasive in the mesohaline regions of the Chesapeake Bay, but few studies have investigated its role in trophic interactions with North American marsh consumers. The marsh periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata is a common grazer in marshes and grazes on the native grass Spartina alterniflora. Whether this snail grazes on Phragmites has not been addressed. We found Spartina leaves to be tougher than those of Phragmites, but despite this, snails consumed significantly more Spartina than Phragmites. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that Phragmites is chemically deterrent to snails by an unknown, moderately polar, compound. Further studies are required to more fully understand the interactions between Phragmites, herbivores, and Spartina, and how they may impact marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Nutrient Enrichment Alters Salt Marsh Fungal Communities and Promotes Putative Fungal Denitrifiers
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enrichment of ecosystems with excess nutrients is occurring at an alarming rate and has fundamentally altered ecosystems worldwide. Salt marshes, which lie at the land-sea interface, are highly effective at removing anthropogenic nutrients through the action of macrophytes and through microbial processes in coastal sediments. The response of salt marsh bacteria to excess nitrogen has been documented; however, the role of fungi and their response to excess nitrogen in salt marsh sediments is not fully understood. Here, we document the response of salt marsh fungal communities to long-term excess nitrate in four distinct marsh habitats within a northern temperate marsh complex. We show that salt marsh fungal communities varied as a function of salt marsh habitat, with both fungal abundance and diversity increasing with carbon quantity. Nutrient enrichment altered fungal communities in all habitats through an increase in fungal abundance and the proliferation of putative fungal denitrifiers. Nutrient enrichment also altered marsh carbon quality in low marsh surface sediments where fungal response to nutrient enrichment was most dramatic, suggesting nutrient enrichment can alter organic matter quality in coastal sediments. Our results indicate that fungi, in addition to bacteria, likely play an important role in anaerobic decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter.

TI  - Top-down and bottom-up controls on southern New England salt marsh crab populations
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern New England salt marsh vegetation and habitats are changing rapidly in response to sea-level rise. At the same time, fiddler crab (Uca spp.) distributions have expanded and purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing on creekbank vegetation has increased. Sea-level rise and reduced predation pressure drive these changing crab populations but most studies focus on one species; there is a need for community-level assessments of impacts from multiple crab species. There is also a need to identify additional factors that can affect crab populations. We sampled crabs and environmental parameters in four Rhode Island salt marshes in 2014 and compiled existing data to quantify trends in crab abundance and multiple factors that potentially affect crabs. Crab communities were dominated by fiddler and green crabs (Carcinus maenas); S. reticulatum was much less abundant. Burrow sizes suggest that Uca is responsible for most burrows. On the marsh platform, burrows and Carcinus abundance were negatively correlated with elevation, soil moisture, and soil percent organic matter and positively correlated with soil bulk density. Uca abundance was negatively correlated with Spartina patens cover and height and positively correlated with Spartina alterniflora cover and soil shear strength. Creekbank burrow density increased dramatically between 1998 and 2016. During the same time, fishing effort and the abundance of birds that prey on crabs decreased, and water levels increased. Unlike in other southern New England marshes where recreational overfishing is hypothesized to drive increasing marsh crab abundance, we propose that changes in crab abundance were likely unrelated to recreational finfish over-harvest; instead, they better track sea-level rise and changing abundances of alternate predators, such as birds. We predict that marsh crab abundance will continue to expand with ongoing sea-level rise, at least until inundation thresholds for crab survival are exceeded.

TI  - A multi-proxy study of sedimentary humic substances in the salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the origin, composition, and reactivity of sedimentary humic substances (HSs) in salt marshes in the Changjiang Estuary, HS samples were isolated from a sediment core that was collected from the Eastern Chongming salt marsh. Chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the features of these HSs. The results indicate that the studied HSs in the salt marsh sediments are mainly terrestrial-derived and that the sedimentary organic matter (SUM) in the top layer may contain more organic matter from marine sources and/or autochthonous materials due to the dramatic decreasing of the sediment supply as a result of damming. The degradation of labile carbohydrates and proteins and the preservation of refractory lignin components dominate the early diagenetic reactions of SUM in the salt marsh area. The average contents of the carboxylic groups in FAs and HAs are 11.64 +/- 1.08 and 7.13 +/- 0.16 meq/gC, and those of phenolic groups are 1.95 +/- 0.13 and 2.40 +/- 0.44 meq/gC, respectively. The content of carboxylic groups increased with increasing depth, while there were no obvious changes in the content of phenolic groups. The average concentration of total proton-binding sites is approximately 12.5 mu mol/g sediment for the studied HSs. These values may provide insight into the migration and fate of HS-bound contaminants in sediments and the overlying sea water in the salt marsh areas of the Changjiang Estuary.

TI  - Consequences of short-term C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora invasions for soil organic carbon dynamics in a coastal wetland of Eastern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of plant invasions are of great concern in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycling. However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of bulk and compound-specific delta C-13 analyses and determination of carbon sources to salt marsh sediments using n-alkane distributions (Maine, USA)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sources of sedimentary organic matter to a Morse River, Maine (USA) salt marsh over the last 3390 +/- 60 RCYBP (Radiocarbon Years Before Present) are determined using distribution patterns of n-alkanes, bulk carbon isotopic analysis, and compound-specific carbon isotopic analysis. Marsh foraminiferal counts suggest a ubiquitous presence of high marsh and higher-high marsh deposits (dominated by Trochammina macrescens forma macrescens, Trochammina comprimata, and Trochammina inflata), implying deposition from similar to 0.2 m to 0.5 m above mean high water. Distributions of n-alkanes show a primary contribution from higher plants, confirmed by an average chain length value of 27.5 for the core sediments, and carbon preference index values all >3. Many sample depths are dominated by the C-25 alkane. Salicornia depressa and Ruppia maritima have similar n-alkane distributions to many of the salt marsh sediments, and we suggest that one or both of these plants is either an important source to the biomass of the marsh through time, or that another unidentified higher plant source is contributing heavily to the sediment pool. Bacterial degradation or algal inputs to the marsh sediments appear to be minor. Compound-specific carbon isotopic analyses of the C-27 alkane are on average 7.27 parts per thousand depleted relative to bulk values, but the two records are strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.89), suggesting that marsh plants dominate the bulk carbon isotopic signal. Our study underscores the importance of using caution when applying mixing models of plant species to salt marsh sediments, especially when relatively few plants are included in the model.

TI  - Combined influence of sedimentation and vegetation on the soil carbon stocks of a coastal wetland in the Changjiang estuary
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Large quantities of sediment deposited in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary by the Changjiang River promote the propagation of coastal wetlands, the expansion of saltmarsh vegetation, and carbon sequestration. In this study, using the Chongming Dongtan Wetland in the Changjiang estuary as the study area, the spatial and temporal distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the influences of sedimentation and vegetation on the SOC stocks of the coastal wetland were examined in 2013. There was sediment accretion in the northern and middle areas of the wetland and in the Phragmites australis marsh in the southern area, and sediment erosion in the Scirpus mariqueter marsh and the bare mudflat in the southern area. More SOC accumulated in sediments of the vegetated marsh than in the bare mudflat. The total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased in the above-ground biomass from spring to autumn and decreased in winter; in the below-ground biomass, they gradually increased from spring to winter. The TOC stocks were higher in the below-ground biomass than in the above-ground biomass in the P. australis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, but were lower in the below-ground biomass in S. mariqueter marsh. Stocks of SOC showed temporal variation and increased gradually in all transects from spring to winter. The SOC stocks tended to decrease from the high marsh down to the bare mudflat along the three transects in the order: P. australis marsh > S. alterniflora marsh > S. mariqueter marsh > bare mudflat. The SOC stocks of the same vegetation type were higher in the northern and middle transects than in the southern transect. These results suggest that interactions between sedimentation and vegetation regulate the SOC stocks in the coastal wetland in the Changjiang estuary.

TI  - A Comprehensive Estuarine Dissolved Organic Carbon Budget Using an Enhanced Biogeochemical Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Complicated biogeochemical cycling and differential organic matter reactivity make quantifying the relative contribution of a given source of organic carbon to the standing stock within an estuary difficult. Here, a new model of tidal marsh-estuary organic carbon cycling is presented for the Rhode River, MD, a well-studied tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. A dissolved organic carbon (DOC) budget was estimated by summing the source and sink terms and the advection of water within the tributary. 13.1% and 15.3% of the total DOC input to the Rhode River entered from the marsh and the watershed, respectively, and 52.6% was derived from phytoplankton production. Extrapolating to the entire year, 35.5 Mg of DOC is exported to the main stem of Chesapeake Bay annually, which accounts for 12.3% of the total allochthonous and autochthonous inputs to the estuary. Removing the modeled marsh at the head of the Rhode River decreased export of DOC to the main stem by 39.2%, and up to 56% of the estuarine DOC standing stock can be attributed to the marsh. The model described here can be used across temperate estuarine systems and provides a new methodology for quantifying the amount of DOC that can be attributed to or lost by specific source and sink pathways.

TI  - Soil organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in a subtropical mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

TI  - Salt Marsh Light Use Efficiency is Driven by Environmental Gradients and Species-Specific Physiology and Morphology
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) of salt marshes has not been well studied but is central to production efficiency models (PEMs) used for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Salt marshes are typically dominated by a species monoculture, resulting in large areas with distinct morphology and physiology. We measured eddy covariance atmospheric CO2 fluxes for two marshes dominated by a different species: Juncus roemerianus in Mississippi and Spartina alterniflora in Georgia. LUE for the Juncus marsh (mean = 0.160 +/- 0.004 g C mol(-1) photon), reported here for the first time, was on average similar to the Spartina marsh (mean = 0.164 +/- 0.003 g C mol(-1) photon). However, Juncus LUE had a greater range (0.073-0.49 g C mol(-1) photon) and higher variability (15.2%) than the Spartina marsh (range: 0.035-0.36 g C mol(-1) photon; variability: 12.7%). We compared the responses of LUE across six environmental gradients. Juncus LUE was predominantly driven by cloudiness, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperature, water table, and vapor pressure deficit. Spartina LUE was driven by water table, air temperature, and cloudiness. We also tested how the definition of LUE (incident PAR vs. absorbed PAR) affected the magnitude of LUE and its response. We found LUE estimations using incident PAR underestimated LUE and masked day-to-day variability. Our findings suggest that salt marsh LUE parametrization should be species-specific due to plant morphology and physiology and their geographic context. These findings can be used to improve PEMs for modeling blue carbon productivity.

TI  - PCBs and HCHs in a salt-marsh sediment record from South-Central Chile: use of tsunami signatures and Cs-137 fallout as temporal markers
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper documents the occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) deposition inferred from a sedimentary record exposed in a salt-marsh trench in South-Central Chile. Sediments were carefully collected every 1 cm from the trench wall. The samples were analyzed for PCBs, HCHs, Cs-137, organic carbon and grain size. The Cs-137 fallout and the sedimentary signature left by the 1960 Chilean tsunami were used as temporal markers to estimate the stratigraphic chronology and the sedimentation rates. PCBs were quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD), and positive samples were confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Based On these results, PCBs and HCHs deposition over the last 40 years was estimated. No PCBs were detected below the tsunami signature. Total concentrations ranged front undetectable (ND) to 32 ng/g d.w. for PCBs and from undetectable (ND) to 1.29 ng/g d.w. for HCHs. The highest PCB concentrations were found in the Upper 7 cut of the core. Even though PCBs were banned in 1982 as electrical fluids in Chile, total estimated PCB fluxes have increased approximately 20 times during the last 40 years: from undetectable values to 102.6 ng/cm(2)/year, reflecting that PCBs are still in use and being released into the environment.

TI  - Evaluation of mercury methylation and methylmercury demethylation rates in vegetated and non-vegetated saltmarsh sediments from two Portuguese estuaries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Neurotoxic methylmercury (MMHg) is formed from inorganic divalent mercury (Hg2+). However, it is poorly understood to what extent different mercury (Hg) pools contribute to existent MMHg levels. In this study, ambient concentrations of total Hg (THg) and MMHg as well as rates of methylation and demethylation were measured simultaneously in sediments with and without salt-marsh plant vegetation, which were collected in Guadiana and Tagus estuaries, Portugal. Concurrent processes of Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation were directly monitored and compared by spiking sediments cores with stable isotope tracers of Hg-199(2+) and (CH3Hg+)-Hg-201 followed by gas chromatographic separation and isotope-specific detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared to the Guadiana estuary, where concentrations were comparatively low, THg and MMHg levels varied between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments collected at the Rosario site (ROS) of the Tagus estuary. Methylation (Km) and demethylation rates (K-D) were also different between estuaries being dependent on the presence of vegetation. In addition, the type of macrophyte species influenced KM and KD values. In fact, the highest KM value was found in Sarcocomia fruticosa vegetated sediments at the Castro Marim site in Guadiana (CM, 0.160 day(-1)) and the lowest KM was observed in non-vegetated sediments at the Alcochete site in Tagus (ALC, 0.009 day(-1)). KD varied by a factor of three among sites with highest rates of demethylation observed in non-vegetated sediments in Guadiana (12 13 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.4 +/- 0.2 h). This study clearly shows that the presence of vegetation in sediments favors the formation of MMHg. Moreover, this effect might be site specific and further studies are needed to confirm the findings reported here. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - New multi-metric Salt Marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) application to salt marsh sediments ecological status assessment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are very important areas for biogeochemical cycling, sediment accretion, pollution filtration and retention and erosion and stabilization of the river margins. The high organic matter content in the salt marsh plant sediments along with the radial oxygen diffusion provided by these halophyte root systems gather the ideal conditions for the development of a microbial rhizosphere community. Due to the quick feedback of the microbial communities to an environmental change, these organisms become important monitors for environmental impact assessment. A Salt marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) that reflected physical-chemical and microbial parameters was applied to plant rhizosphere sediments of five salt marshes from three important water bodies from Portugal. The SSMI revealed to be plant-independent evaluating efficiently the different marshes according to their maturity degree and disturbance influence. Mature salt marshes SSMI classification grouped all the systems at this development stage, while the younger salt marshes are classified in different groups according to their evolution degree. Also the impact degree is reflected at this level discriminating also the more adversely impacted salt marshes. Being a multi-metric index, the SSMI sub-metrics are also susceptible of ecological interpretation, giving important backstage information about the underlying biogeochemical cycling processes.

TI  - Groundwater dynamics in a restored tidal marsh are limited by historical soil compaction
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In places where tidal marshes were formerly embanked for agricultural land use, these marshes are nowadays increasingly restored with the aim to regain important ecosystem services. However, there is growing evidence that restored tidal marshes and their services develop slowly and differ from natural tidal marshes in many aspects. Here we focus on groundwater dynamics, because these affect several key ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and vegetation development. We hypothesize that groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are reduced as compared to natural marshes because of the difference in soil structure. In the macro-tidal Schelde estuary (Belgium), in both a natural and a restored (since 2006) freshwater tidal marsh, we measured depth profiles of soil properties (grain size distribution, LOI (loss on ignition), moisture content and bulk density) and temporal dynamics of groundwater levels along a transect with increasing distance from a tidal creek. X-ray micro CT-scanning was used to quantify soil macroporosity. The restored marsh has a two layered soil stratigraphy with a topsoil of freshly accreted sediment (ranging in depth between 10 and 60 cm, deposited since 2006) and a subsoil of compact relict agricultural soil. We found that both the soil in the natural marsh and the topsoil of the restored marsh consist of loosely packed sediment rich in macropores and organic matter, whereas the relict agricultural soil in the restored marsh is densely packed and has few macropores. Our results show that groundwater level fluctuations in the restored marsh are restricted to the top layer of newly deposited sediment (i.e. on average 0.08 m depth). Groundwater level fluctuations in the natural marsh occur over a larger depth of the soil profile (i.e. on average 0.28 m depth). As a consequence, the reduced groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are expected to alter the subsurface fluxes of water and nutrients, the source sink function and the development of marsh vegetation.

TI  - A Coupled Biomorpho-Geomechanical Model of Tidal Marsh Evolution
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecogeomorphic characteristics of tidal marshes are strongly related to their elevation with respect to the mean sea level. Predicting the long-term evolution and resilience of such ecosystems in times of rapid natural and anthropogenic climate changes is of critical importance. The notion that the tidal marsh elevation is the result of feedbacks between vegetation dynamics, sediment fluxes, natural consolidation, and sea-level changes is widely recognized. However, the interaction of these processes has been poorly investigated until now. This contribution aims at presenting a novel numerical model to simulate the above-surface and subsurface coupled dynamics of a tidal landscape in a 2-D-framework, with the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) acting as an external stressor. A biomorphological model is used to compute deposition fluxes, which depends on topography and availability of organic/inorganic sediments. The outcome is used as forcing term in a physically based geomechanical model to simulate the consolidation of the marsh body that, in turn, influences sediment fluxes by acting on the platform elevation. The results demonstrate how compaction of the marsh body can crucially affect the resilience of tidal landforms to RSLR accelerations. With normal sediment concentration in coastal waters (10< C-0 <100 mg/l), if minerogenic (stiff) deposits prevail, a tidal marsh is capable of maintaining its elevation relative to mean sea level independently of RSLR (at least up to 10 mm/yr). When the marsh is composed of a large percentage of more compressible organic matter, the landform resilience is much more dependent on RSLR, implying higher vulnerability with respect to future climate changes.

TI  - Revisiting salt marsh resilience to sea level rise: Are ponds responsible for permanent land loss?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ponds are unvegetated rounded depressions commonly present on marsh platforms. The role of ponds on the long-term morphological evolution of tidal marshes is unclearat times ponds expand but eventually recover the marsh platform, at other times ponds never recover and lead to permanent marsh loss. Existing field observations indicate that episodic disturbances of the marsh vegetation cause the formation of small (1-10m) isolated ponds, even if the vegetated platform keeps pace with relative sea level rise (RSLR) and that isolated ponds tend to deepen and enlarge until they eventually connect to the channel network. Here I implement a simple model to study the vertical and planform evolution of a single connected pond. A newly connected pond recovers if its bed lies above the limit for marsh plant growth or if the inorganic deposition rate is larger than the RSLR rate. A pond that cannot accrete faster than RSLR will deepen and enlarge, eventually entering a runaway erosion by wave edge retreat. A large tidal range, a large sediment supply, and a low rate of RSLR favor pond recovery. The model suggests that inorganic sediment deposition alone controls pond recovery, even in marshes where organic matter dominates accretion of the vegetated platform. As such, halting permanent marsh loss by pond collapse requires to increase inorganic sediment deposition. Because pond collapse is possible even if the vegetated platform keeps pace with RSLR, I conclude that marsh resilience to RSLR is less than previously quantified.

TI  - Environmental drivers affecting the bacterial community of intertidal sediments in the Yellow Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal flats, as transition zones where terrestrial and marine ecosystems meet, provide unique environments and play an important role in marine ecosystems. In particular, the environmental characteristics of tidal marshes show are different than those of bare flats, especially in the rhizosphere. However, unlike the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, the rhizosphere of plants in tidal marsh areas and the associated microbial community have been the focus of very little research. Thus, this study investigated the diversity and variation in bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of a Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica and along the sediment depths. High-throughput sequencing was performed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene of environmental DNA extracted from sediment cores, and indicator species were identified with respect to the vegetation type and sediment depth. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes. In general, the results indicated that not only vegetation type and sediment depth themselves but also their interaction resulted in significant differences among the bacterial communities. The envfit results revealed that the environmental variables of sediment, such as mud content, organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The indicator species varied depending on the vegetation type and sediment depth, showing significant correlations with certain selected environmental variables, but were fundamentally related to the rhizosphere. Overall, this study revealed the key factors that determine the bacterial community structure in tidal marshes and the indicator species according to vegetation type in the little studied rhizosphere of the intertidal ecosystem.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the communities of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria in estuarine marsh sediments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of plant invasion on the microorganisms of soil sediments is very important for estuary ecology. The community structures of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) as a function of Spartina alterniflora invasion in Phragmites australis-vegetated sediments of the Dongtan wetland in the Yangtze River estuary, China, were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) and dissimilatory sulfite-reductase (dsrB) genes. Sediment samples were collected from two replicate locations, and each location included three sampling stands each covered by monocultures of P. australis, S. alterniflora and both plants (transition stands), respectively. qPCR analysis revealed higher copy numbers of mcrA genes in sediments from S. alterniflora stands than P. australis stands (5- and 7.5-fold more in the spring and summer, respectively), which is consistent with the higher methane flux rates measured in the S. alterniflora stands (up to 8.01 +/- 5.61 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Similar trends were observed for SRB, and they were up to two orders of magnitude higher than the methanogens. Diversity indices indicated a lower diversity of methanogens in the S. alterniflora stands than the P. australis stands. In contrast, insignificant variations were observed in the diversity of SRB with the invasion. Although Methanomicrobiales and Methanococcales, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, dominated in the salt marsh, Methanomicrobiales displayed a slight increase with the invasion and growth of S. alterniflora, whereas the later responded differently. Methanosarcina, the metabolically diverse methanogens, did not vary with the invasion of, but Methanosaeta, the exclusive acetate utilizers, appeared to increase with S. alterniflora invasion. In SRB, sequences closely related to the families Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae dominated in the salt marsh, although they displayed minimal changes with the S. alterniflora invasion. Approximately 11.3 +/- 5.1% of the dsrB gene sequences formed a novel cluster that was reduced upon the invasion. The results showed that in the sediments of tidal salt marsh where S. alterniflora displaced P. australis, the abundances of methanogens and SRB increased, but the community composition of methanogens appeared to be influenced more than did the SRB.

TI  - Contemporary Rates of Carbon Sequestration Through Vertical Accretion of Sediments in Mangrove Forests and Saltmarshes of South East Queensland, Australia
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests and saltmarshes are important habitats for carbon (C) sequestration in the coastal zone but variation in rates of C sequestration and the factors controlling sequestration are poorly understood. We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.

CP  - 42nd ECSA Symposium on Estuarine Ecosystems - Structure, Function and Management
CL  - Svetlogorsk, RUSSIA
AB  - Salt marshes constitute highly productive systems playing an important role on ecosystem functions. The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

TI  - Effects of Rhizophora mangle leaf litter and seedlings on carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marshes - potential consequences of climate-induced mangrove migration
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Due to the production of large amounts of tannins and phenolics by Rhizophora mangle, it was hypothesized that the invasion of this mangrove species in salt marshes due to global warming will result in changes in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen.Methods Leaf litter and/or seedlings of R. mangle were placed into 1-m(2) experimental plots in a Distichlis spicata-dominated salt marsh on the Atlantic Coast of central Florida (USA). An additional litter decomposition experiment was conducted in all plots by adding litter bags containing 10 g of dried D. spicata shoot litter. Seedling growth was measured yearly. One and four years after the start of the experiment, soil samples were collected to determine physical and chemical soil conditions, potential nitrification and denitrification activities and abundances of genes that are related to microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle.Results Growth of R. mangle seedlings was stimulated in the presence of R. mangle litter, while decomposition rates of D. spicata litter were lower in plots with R. mangle litter and seedlings. The presence of R. mangle litter and/or seedlings had no significant effect on potential nitrification and denitrification activities and on the abundances of genes.Conclusions The colonization of R. mangle into D. spicata-dominated salt marshes will affect the carbon cycle, but not necessarily the nitrogen cycle, which is likely due to the pre-existing nitrogen-limited conditions in the salt marsh.

TI  - Opposite diel patterns of nitrogen fixation associated with salt marsh plant species (Spartina foliosa and Salicornia virginica) in southern California
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - In marine wetlands, nitrogen fixation is a potentially important nutrient source for nitrogen-limited primary producers, but interactions between nitrogen fixer's and different vascular plant species are not fully understood. Nitrogen fixation activity was compared in sediments vegetated by three plant species, Spartina foliosa, Salicornia virginica, and Salicornia bigelovii in the Kendall Frost Reserve salt marsh in Mission Bay (CA). This study addressed the effects of plant type, day and night conditions, and sediment depths on nitrogen fixation. Higher rates of nitrogen fixation were associated with S. foliosa than with either of the two Salicornia spp., which are known to compete more effectively than Spartina for exogenous nitrogen in the salt marsh environment. Rates of nitrogen fixation, determined by acetylene reduction, in sediments vegetated by S. virginica were low during the day (7.7 +/- 1.2 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1)) but averaged 13 +/- 6.6 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1) at night, with particularly high rates in samples from locations with visible cyanobacterial mats. The opposite diel pattern was found for sediments containing S. foliosa plants, in which average daytime and nighttime rates of nitrogen fixation were 62 +/- 23 and 21 +/- 15 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. For S. foliosa, nitrogenase activity of rinsed roots and different sediment sections (0-1, or 4-5 cm depths) were measured. Although nitrogen fixation rates in vegetated sediment samples were substantial, all but one of rinsed S. foliosa root samples (n = 12) and subsurface sediments at 4-5 cm depths failed to show nitrogen fixation activity after 2 h, suggesting that the most active nitrogen fixers in these systems likely reside in, surface sediments. Further, nitrogenase activity in shaded and unshaded S. foliosa samples did not differ, suggesting that nitrogen fixers may not rapidly respond to changes in plant photosynthetic activity. Average nitrogen fixation rates in S. foliosa-vegetated samples from the Mission Bay salt marsh were on the same order as those of highly productive Atlantic coast marshes, and this microbially-mediated nitrogen source may be similarly substantial in other Mediterranean wetlands. Sediment abiotic variables seem to exert greater control upon nitrogen fixation activity than the effects of particular plant species. Nonetheless, dominant plant species may differ substantially in their reliance on nitrogen fixation as a nutrient source, with potentially important consequences for wetland conservation and restoration.

TI  - Tidal effects on ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Phragmites salt marsh of an intertidal shoal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms and controlling factors of ecosystem CO2 exchange in tidal wetlands is of great benefit for research concerning the global carbon cycle and climate change. In spite of this, the multiple controls of ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange in coastal wetlands subject to subdaily tidal flooding have yet to be adequately addressed. In this study, we investigated the tidal influence on ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Phragmites salt marsh of an intertidal shoal in the Changjiang estuary, based on eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The results revealed that the study area acted as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE = -901 g C m(-2)) in 2018. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (T-a), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were major drivers of NEE on both diel and multi-day scales. The fides, along with the bio-meteorological variables, strongly affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) in the tidal wetland, especially on the multi-day scale. Regardless of which flux partitioning method was utilized, tidal inundation generally imposed inhibitory effects on GPP, which were directly attributed to tidal water level (TWL) and salinity. The daytime data-based estimates of R-eco was also suppressed on average under the tidal inundation condition when T-a was higher relative to the non-inundation condition, reflecting the influence of TWL on R-eco and the reduced sensitivity of R-eco to T-a. We observed that NEE responded positively or negatively to tidal flooding, depending on the magnitude of tidal suppression on GPP and R-eco. When T-a was roughly between 28 and 32 degrees C and PAR was > 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), GPP was suppressed by fides more than R-eco during the early and rapid vegetative stage, while during the peak vegetative stage, the opposite was true. This study not only shows the unique impact of tidal salt marsh wetlands on carbon uptake, but it also represents an example of a coastal wetland in which tidal inundation promotes the net uptake of CO2.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion and exogenous nitrogen on soil nitrogen mineralization in the coastal salt marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of Spartina alterniflora, exogenous nitrogen (N) input and climate change in the coastal wetlands in the east of China may interactively affect soil N mineralization in costal salt marshes. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted with two exogenous N forms (NO3--N and NH4+-N), six temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three plant marshes (the invasive S. alterniflora and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) to investigate these interactive effects on soil net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate in coastal wetlands. The averaged rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification over incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C were significantly higher in the S. alterniflora marsh than in the S. salsa and P. australis marshes. The differences in N mineralization and nitrification among the tested soils were closely related with soil properties. With the addition of NO3--N, net N mineralization and nitrification were increased in the studied soils by 16-29% and 34-54%, respectively, whereas with the addition of NH4+N, they were increased by 58-69% and 65-94%, respectively. Net mineralization and nitrification in the tested soils increased with incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C regardless of N addition. However, N addition (either NH4+N or NO3--N) not only dramatically raised the sensitivity of net N mineralization in the S. alterniflora marsh to temperature fluctuation, but also remarkably enhanced the percentage of net nitrification in net mineralization at incubation temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C, with peak values at 25 degrees C for all studied soils. These results suggest that under a changing climate, N supplying capacity of the S. alterniflora soil, as well as N pool, is notably great, which may shed light on the mechanism of rapid expansion of S. alterniflora in coastal China.

TI  - Biogeochemical functioning of grazed estuarine tidal marshes along a salinity gradient
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Depending on their location along an estuarine salinity gradient, tidal marshes are thought to have different impacts on the chemical composition of the water during flooding. However, there is a lack of direct measurements of fluxes occurring between the marsh surface and the water column to corroborate this hypothesis. This study compared fluxes of nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) between the water column and the marsh surface and the emission of greenhouse gases, at four sites located along the salinity gradient of an estuary of north-western Wales (UK). The exchanges of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DON), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus and silicic acid, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were measured during tidal inundation in May and September 2008 using in situ incubation chambers. There was no linear pattern along the salinity gradient and the concentration of nutrients and DOC in the flood water did not appear to control the biogeochemical processes driving the marsh surface/water column exchanges in the studied marshes. Multivariate analysis showed a clear discrimination in functioning between sites with the fresh and brackish marshes having a more similar functioning compared to low and middle marshes. The main differences between these two groupings were in the fluxes of DOC and nitrate. The phenology of plant species, soil organic matter content and soil oxygenation appear be the dominant factors explaining the observed fluxes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Salt Marshes as Groundwater Buffers for Development: A Survey of South Carolina Salt Marsh Basins
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes serve as zones of intense groundwater mixing and reaction between freshwater uplands and estuaries. This raises the question of whether the impacts of upland development on nutrient and carbon species can be transmitted through salt marshes via groundwater, or whether salt marshes can buffer estuarine waters from coastal development. We sampled groundwater from fifteen tidal creek basins in South Carolina to test for compositional differences associated with development and marsh width. Groundwater samples from near creekbanks and below freshwater uplands were analyzed for salinity, total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon. Analyses revealed significantly higher TDN and TDP concentrations in creekbank samples from developed watersheds, independent of the season. Analyses of upland samples revealed significantly lower DOC concentrations in developed uplands, again independent of season. These results support the hypothesis that development can affect groundwater compositions in coastal groundwater and therefore may affect coastal nutrient and carbon fluxes. However, results also revealed significant linear correlations between marsh width, salinity, and nutrient concentrations in some marshes. These results suggest that salt marshes can act as buffers for development, and specifically suggests that the buffering capacity of salt marshes increases with width. Narrow or trenched salt marshes are far less likely to be effective buffers.

TI  - Effects of in situ experimental air warming on the soil respiration in a coastal salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The reclamation of natural salt marshes for agricultural use is expected to profoundly influence the effects of predicted global warming on the carbon balance of coastal areas globally. This study was undertaken to understand the potential for soil respiration changes in a disturbed coastal ecosystem under future atmospheric warmingAn in situ simulated warming experiment was conducted in a reclaimed salt marsh on Chongming Island in the Yangtze Estuary, China. Open-top chambers (OTCs) were applied to simulate air-warming conditions.Based on the 2-year study, we found the following: (1) Averaged across the entire study period, the OTCs significantly increased the mean air temperature by 1.53 +/- 0.17 A degrees C. (2) The air warming resulted in no significant stimulation of the mean soil respiration averaged across the entire study period. Warming had no significant effect on soil respiration in the growing season, but it markedly reduced soil respiration by 16 % in the non-growing season. (3) Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature or volumetric moisture at a 5 cm depth, but it increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119 % averaged across the entire study period. (4) Air warming had no significant effect on total organic carbon, total nitrogen or the molar C/molar N ratio of the soil in the uppermost 10 cm layer during the 2 years of soil respiration measurement. The warming treatment also had no significant effect on aboveground biomass or fine root (< 2 mm) density during the second year of soil respiration measurement. (5) Soil temperature accounted for 81.0 % and 79.0 % of the temporal variations of soil respiration in the control (CON) and elevated temperature (ET) plots, respectively. No significant correlation between soil volumetric moisture and soil respiration was observed in either CON or ET. Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET. No change of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10) value) was observed.Based on above results, we speculate that soil porewater salinity was the key factor controlling the effects of air warming on soil respiration in the reclaimed salt marsh. Our results suggest that an air warming of approximately 1.5 A degrees C over the next few decades may not lead to a higher soil respiration in reclaimed salt marshes.

TI  - THE ROLE OF SALT MARSH PLANTS AND MICROORGANISMS IN SEDIMENT METAL BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
T2  - HANDBOOK OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Salt marshes were often installed in the proximity of cities and industrialized areas. In these cases, flooding transports large quantities of contaminants in both dissolved and suspended particulate forms to the salt marsh areas. Anthropogenic metals are incorporated in the sediments, decreasing their availability in the water column. Vascular plants in salt marshes are determinant to the dynamics of the estuarine ecosystem and strongly influence the processes of accumulation and retention of heavy metals in these areas. The utilization of wetlands as filters has gained great interest in the past decades. However, the role that plants play in the filter function of wetlands in relation to metals is still a matter of investigation.When the metal contaminants enter in the salt marsh they spread along with the tides and periodic floods and interact with soil and the biotic community. Salt marsh plants are known to accumulate large amounts of metals in their aerial and belowground organs but also for their ability to phytostabilize these contaminants in the rhizosediment, playing an important role in the this ecosystem autoremediative processes and biogeochemistry.When we consider the possible toxic effects of metals to the marsh ecosystem and also to human health, the total amount of metal is not as important as the chemical form that is present, responsible for the bioavailability to the plant uptake and consequently to the introduction in the food web. Activity of plant roots and associated microbes can alter physical and chemical properties of the sediment, influencing geochemical fractionation of metals and thus availability to the plant. Organic matter pools are known to be highly efficient sinks of heavy metals, constituting an important fraction of metal species, present in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter cycles are supported by microbial enzymatic degradation mechanisms and consequently affect the organic bound metals. Along with this, microbial driven sulphidisation is also an important factor when considering speciation processes. Without ignoring physic-chemical factors, as pH, Eh and oxygen profiles, microbial speciation processes assume a very important role, unconsidered in most studies.In this chapter it will be discussed the influence of vascular plants and microbial activity in salt marsh sediments and its consequences in metal chemical speciation.

TI  - Mangrove expansion and salt marsh decline at mangrove poleward limits
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are species of halophytic intertidal trees and shrubs derived from tropical genera and are likely delimited in latitudinal range by varying sensitivity to cold. There is now sufficient evidence that mangrove species have proliferated at or near their poleward limits on at least five continents over the past half century, at the expense of salt marsh. Avicennia is the most cold-tolerant genus worldwide, and is the subject of most of the observed changes. Avicennia germinans has extended in range along the USA Atlantic coast and expanded into salt marsh as a consequence of lower frost frequency and intensity in the southern USA. The genus has also expanded into salt marsh at its southern limit in Peru, and on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Mangroves of several species have expanded in extent and replaced salt marsh where protected within mangrove reserves in Guangdong Province, China. In south-eastern Australia, the expansion of Avicennia marina into salt marshes is now well documented, and Rhizophora stylosa has extended its range southward, while showing strong population growth within estuaries along its southern limits in northern New South Wales. Avicennia marina has extended its range southwards in South Africa. The changes are consistent with the poleward extension of temperature thresholds coincident with sea-level rise, although the specific mechanism of range extension might be complicated by limitations on dispersal or other factors. The shift from salt marsh to mangrove dominance on subtropical and temperate shorelines has important implications for ecological structure, function, and global change adaptation.

TI  - Response of soil microbial respiration of tidal wetlands in the Yangtze River Estuary to increasing temperature and sea level: A simulative study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Undisturbed natural wetlands are considered carbon sequesters because of their high primary productivity and low soil microbial respiration (SMR). Tidal wetlands in Yangtze River Estuary are typical and impermanent original ecological coastal salt marshes, and their carbon sequestration functions are of great significance to the balance of carbon emissions from Shanghai. Global warming and its associated effects comprise one of the most serious environmental problems humans are currently facing. To analyze changes in the SMR of tidal wetlands in the Yangtze River Estuary in response to global warming and the associated increase in sea level, a simulation study was conducted in the laboratory. The results show that when organic input is limited, increasing temperature can lead to an initial sharp increase in SMR, but that the SMR reverts to its original level with time even becomes lower. Overall, increasing the temperature does not have a significant effect on SMR because organic input is limited under these conditions. Increasing sea level can accelerate SMR and beta-glucosidase activity, but this effect is not significant. This may occur because more nutrients are input by the tide, which facilitates SMR by attenuating the disadvantage associated with the anaerobic environment caused by prolonged water logging. However, synergistic effect of increased temperature and sea level lead to an obvious acceleration in SMR and beta-glucosidase activity. In tidal soil in which the soil nutrient levels are low, organic matter input is found to be the dominant factor affecting SMR and microbial activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Whether hurricane Katrina impacted trace metal and dioxin depositional histories in marshes of St. Louis Bay, Mississippi
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh sediments generally undergo steady accumulation over time and thus are widely used to reconstruct the depositional histories of various anthropogenic contaminants derived from atmospheric and fluvial sources. Major hurricanes can significantly affect coastal landscapes by eroding and re-distributing sediment. Thus, each major hurricane can leave distinct signals in coastal wetland sediments. On the other hand, early-diagenetic remobilization of Fe and Mn in organic rich marsh sediment is a common phenomenon. However, remobilization of Fe and Mn across the redox boundary can induce remobilization of other trace elements and thus can disturb their depositional histories. Four short (similar to 1 m) sediment cores were collected from the fringing marshes of St. Louis Bay, Mississippi (located similar to 30 km east of Hurricane Katrina's track) during 2010-2011 to investigate possible impacts of Hurricane Katrina (2005), and early-diagenetic remobilization of Fe and Mn, on trace metal and dioxin depositional histories in these sediments. Results from Pb-210, Cs-137, stable Cs, particulate organic carbon (POC), sediment bulk density and grain size indicate significant impact of hurricane event layers on anthropogenic stable Cs, while deposition profiles of V, Ni and Cr are impacted by Fe and Mn remobilization to a limited extent.

TI  - Trace element concentrations in saltmarsh soils strongly affected by wastes from metal sulphide mining areas
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil and water samples were analysed for trace metals and As in two watercourses and 14 sampling plots in a salt marsh polluted by mine wastes in SE Spain. Groundwater levels, soil pH and Eh were measured 'in situ' for a 12-month period in each sampling plot, and total calcium carbonate was also determined. Low concentrations of soluble metals (maximum Mn 1.089 mg L-1 and maximum Zn 0.553 mg L-1) were found in the watercourses. However, total metal contents were extremely high in the soils of a zone of the salt marsh (maximum 1,933 mg kg(-1) of Mn, 62,280 mg kg(-1) of Zn, 16,845 mg kg(-1) of Pb, 77 mg kg(-1) of Cd, 418 mg kg(-1) of Cu and 725 mg kg(-1) of As), and soluble metals in the pore water reached 38.7 mg L-1 for Zn, 3.15 mg L-1 for Pb, 48.0 mg L-1 for Mn, 0.61 mg L-1 for Cd and 0.29 mg L-1 for As. Variable concentrations with depth indicate a possible re-mobilisation of the metals, which could be related to spatial and temporal variations of water table level, pH and Eh and to the presence of calcium carbonate. A tendency for the Eh to decrease in the warmest months and to increase in the coldest ones was found, especially, in plots that received water with a high content of dissolved organic carbon. Hence, the existence of nutrient effluent-enriched water may modify the physical-chemical conditions of the soil-water system and influence metal mobility.

TI  - Vegetation and hydrology stratification as proxies to estimate methane emission from tidal marshes
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct measurement of methane emissions is cost-prohibitive for greenhouse gas offset projects, necessitating the development of alternative accounting methods such as proxies. Salinity is a useful proxy for tidal marsh CH4 emissions when comparing across a wide range of salinity regimes but does not adequately explain variation in brackish and freshwater regimes, where variation in emissions is large. We sought to improve upon the salinity proxy in a marsh complex on Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland, USA by comparing emissions from four strata differing in hydrology and plant community composition. Mean CH4 chamber-collected emissions measured as mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) ranked as S. alterniflora (1.2 +/- 0.3) >> High-elevation J. roemerianus (0.4 +/- 0.06) > Low-elevation J. roemerianus (0.3 +/- 0.07) = S. patens (0.1 +/- 0.01). Sulfate depletion generally reflected the same pattern with significantly greater depletion in the S. alterniflora stratum (61 +/- 4%) than in the S. patens stratum (1 +/- 9%) with the J. roemerianus strata falling in between. We attribute the high CH4 emissions in the S. alterniflora stratum to sulfate depletion likely driven by limited connectivity to tidal waters. Low CH4 emissions in the S. patens stratum are attributed to lower water levels, higher levels of ferric iron, and shallow rooting depth. Moderate CH4 emissions from the J. roemerianus strata were likely due to plant traits that favor CH4 oxidation over CH4 production. Hydrology and plant community composition have significant potential as proxies to estimate CH4 emissions at the site scale.

TI  - Ecosystem service delivery in restoration projects: the effect of ecological succession on the benefits of tidal marsh restoration
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term assessment of ecosystem restoration projects is complex because of ecological processes such as succession, particularly in highly dynamic ecosystems such as estuaries. Restoration of intertidal flats and marshes on formerly embanked land, often called managed coastal realignment (MR), became popular in estuarine management. In our study, biophysical and monetary data were collected to calculate the value of 15 (sub) ecosystem services (ES) delivered by a large tidal marsh restoration project in the Schelde estuary in Belgium and the Netherlands. We hypothesized that ES delivery changes over time due to ecological succession and hence the long-term benefits are subject to this phenomenon and need to be taken into consideration. A marsh sediment accretion model (MARSED) was used to simulate potential marsh succession scenarios. In this way, the temporal evolution of ES delivery caused by ecological succession could be evaluated. Our study shows that benefits during successional marsh stages could actually be higher than for marshes in equilibrium. This finding does not suggest that ecosystems in transition always have a higher value than systems in equilibrium, but emphasizes the need to consider long-term ecological dynamics, such as succession, in a benefit assessment for restoration projects.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a Created Brackish Marsh in Eastern North Carolina
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marsh creation helps remediate global warming because tidal wetlands are especially proficient at sequestering carbon (C) in soils. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) losses can offset the climatic benefits gained from C storage depending on how these tidal marshes are constructed and managed. This study attempts to determine the GHG emissions from a 4-6 year old created brackish marsh, what environmental factors governed these emissions, and how the magnitude of the fluxes relates to other wetland ecosystems. The static flux chamber method was used to measure GHG fluxes across three distinct plant zones segregated by elevation. The major of soil GHG fluxes from the marsh were from CO2 (-48-192 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), although it was near the lower end of values reported from other wetland types having lower salinities, and would mostly be offset by photosynthetic uptake in this created brackish marsh. Methane flux was also low (-0.33-0.86 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), likely inhibited by the high soil SO4 (2-) and soil redox potentials poised above -150 mV in this in this created brackish marsh environment. Low N2O flux (-0.11-0.10 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) was due to low soil NO3 (-) and soil redox conditions favoring complete denitrification. GHG fluxes from this created brackish marsh were generally lower than those recorded from natural marshes, suggesting that C sequestration may not be offset by the radiative forcing from soil GHG emissions if projects are designed properly.

TI  - Seasonal not annual precipitation drives 8-year variability of interannual net CO2 exchange in a salt marsh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are significant contributors to global "blue carbon" resources, and these habitats are sensitive to precipitation events due to periodically dry-wet alternation induced by tides. However, whether annual marsh-atmospheric CO2 flux responds more to annual or seasonal precipitation remains unclear. Here, eight years (2012-2019) of eddy covariance data were evaluated to determine typical CO2 budgets, and we assessed the effect of annual and seasonal precipitation on interannual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta, China. The salt marsh was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the eight study years, with an 8-year average NEE of -51.7 +/- 9.7 g C m(-2) a(-1) varying from -8 to -85 g C m(-2) a(-1). Annual NEE was mainly regulated by precipitation levels during the early growth stage of plants, which modulated maximal plant biomass accumulation via water-salt transport. Besides, a spring precipitation distribution experiment showed that wetter early growth stage of plants enhanced carbon assimilation capacity in the salt marsh by decreasing soil salinity and promoting plant biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that soil water-salt conditions induced by precipitation during the onset of the growing season are crucial for interannual variations of NEE in salt marshes.

TI  - Community diversity and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in marsh wetlands in the black soil zone in North-east China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its first detection, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have been proven to be ubiquitous in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, two freshwater marsh wetlands- the Honghe wetland and Qixinghe wetland - in the black soil zone in North-east China were chosen to investigate the AOA community diversity and distribution in wetland soils with different vegetation and depth. In the Honghe wetland, two sampling locations were chosen as the dominant plant transited from Deyeuxia to Carex. In the Qixinghe wetland, one sample location that was dominated by Deyeuxia was chosen. Samples of each location were collected from three different depths, and Illumina MiSeq platform was used to generate the AOA amoA gene archive. The results showed that the AOA amoA genes in the soils of the two wetlands were affiliated with three lineages: Nitrososphaera, Nitrosotalea, and Nitrosopumilus clusters. The different dominant status of these AOA lineages indicated their differences in adapting to acidic habitat, oxygenic/hypoxic alternation, organic matter, and other environmental factors, suggesting high diversity among AOA in marsh soils. The main driver of the AOA community was pH, along with organic carbon and ammonium nitrogen, which also played an important role combined with many other environmental factors. Thus, soil physiochemical characteristics, rather than vegetation, were the main cause of AOA community diversity in the wetlands in the black soil zone in China (c) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019

TI  - IMPACTS OF DENSE CRAB POPULATIONS ON CARBON EXCHANGES ACROSS THE SURFACE OF A SALT-MARSH
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of 2 crab species, Sesarma catenata and Cleistostoma edwardsii, on carbon exchanges across the surface of a south temperate salt marsh. The grapsoid crab S. catenata was most abundant in the vegetated marsh flats, and the ocypodoid C. edwardsii in the unvegetated tidal creek. Replicate mesocosms of the marsh flats and tidal creek were incubated with and without crabs of the species dominant in that region. Both species enhanced the losses of carbon relative to uptake by the marsh, but they did so via different mechanisms. In the tidal creek, C. edwardsii increased the net fluxes of total organic carbon (TOC) by 60 % (or 448 mg C m-2 d-1), but had no significant impact on community net production (NP). (Bioturbation accounted for 95 %of the enhanced TOC fluxes, and excretion only 5 %). In the marsh flats, S. catenata had no measurable impact on the fluxes of TOC, but decreased community NP by 1132 mg C m-2 d-1. (Ninety-two percent of this reduction was caused through reduction in epibenthic NP through crab grazing of microalgae. Crab respiration accounted for only 8 % of the reduction). The crab effects were sufficient to determine whether, for a tide of a particular tide elevation, the marsh functioned aS d carbon source or sink. When crabs were absent, the marsh functioned as a carbon sink at all except the very highest tides that, in turn, accounted for only 3 % of all tides inundating the marsh. When crabs were present, the marsh functioned as a carbon source at 87 %, and all except the very lowest tides.

TI  - LIMITED RESPONSE OF CORDGRASS (SPARTINA-FOLIOSA) TO SOIL AMENDMENTS IN A CONSTRUCTED MARSH
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Constructed marshes in San Diego Bay (California, USA) have short canopies of the cordgrass Spartina foliosa and soils that are low in organic matter and nitrogen, compared to natural salt marshes of this area. Thus, we hypothesized that organic and nitrogen amendments would accelerate plant growth and enrich soil nitrogen pools. A field experiment in a newly excavated mitigation site examined the effects of adding ammonium sulfate (N), nitrogen-rich alfalfa (with or without added N), and nitrogen-poor straw (with or without added N) prior to planting. Aboveground biomass and stem densities of cordgrass were proportional to the amount of N added, whether in the organic or inorganic form. Alfalfa decomposed more rapidly than straw, but in both cases, N was lost quickly (50-66% in 2 wk). Sediment nitrogen and carbon pools were not increased significantly by the amendments. High decomposition rates and sandy soils apparently prevented accumulation of N in the nutrient and/or organic matter pools. Less than 5% of the nitrogen potentially available for uptake was actually recovered in aerial tissue. With N-poor soil and high nutrient-loss rates, the experimental plots developed less than half the aboveground biomass found in reference natural cordgrass marshes. Amending soils prior to transplantation did not achieve the goal of functional equivalency with natural marshes, and after 2 yr there was no indication that nutrient pools or plant growth rates would achieve natural levels.

TI  - Field-scale simulation of methane emissions from coastal wetlands in China using an improved version of CH4MOD(wetland)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important CH4 sources to the atmosphere. Coastal wetlands account for similar to 10% of the total area of natural wetlands in China, but the size of this potential CH4 source remains highly uncertain. We introduced the influence of salinity on CH4 production and CH4 diffusion into a biogeophysical model named CH4MOD(wetland) so that it can be used in coastal wetlands. The improved model can generally simulate seasonal CH4 variations from tidal marshes dominated by Phragmites and Scirpus. However, the model underestimated winter CH4 fluxes from tidal marshes in the Yellow River Delta and YanCheng Estuary. It also failed to capture the accurate timing of the CH4 peaks in YanCheng Estuary and ChongMing Island in 2012. The improved model could generally simulate the difference between the annual mean CH4 fluxes from mangrove sites in GuangZhou and HaiKou city under different salinity and water table depth conditions, although fluxes were systematically underestimated in the mangrove site of HaiKou city. Using the improved model, the seasonal CH4 emissions simulated across all of the coastal wetlands ranged from 0.1 to 44.90 g m(-2), with an average value of 7.89 gm(-2), which is in good agreement with the observed values. The improved model significantly decreased the RMSE and RMD from 424% to 14% and 314% to -2%, respectively, and improved the EF from -18.30 to 0.99. Model sensitivity analysis showed that CH4 emissions were most sensitive to P-ox in the tidal marshes and salinity in the mangroves. The results show that previous studies may have overestimated CH4 emissions on a regional or global scale by neglecting the influence of salinity. In general, the CH4MOD(wetland) model can simulate seasonal CH4 emissions from different types of coastal wetlands under various conditions. Further improvements of CH4MOD(wetland) should include the specific characteristics of CH4 processes in mangroves to decrease the uncertainty in estimating regional or global CH4 emissions from natural wetlands.

TI  - Salt Marshes on Substrate Enriched in Organic Matter: The Case of Ombrogenic Atlantic Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes are defined as areas of halophytic, terrestrial vegetation which are periodically flooded by the tide and have a predominant underlying organic substrate comprising of wood and/or Sphagnum peat that formed under freshwater conditions. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes. The findings confirm that the high organic matter content of ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes is associated with distinct vegetation composition.

TI  - Influence of Physical Manipulations on Short-Term Salt Marsh Morphodynamics: Examples from the North and Mid-Atlantic Coast, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the mid- and north Atlantic coasts of the USA, over 90 % of salt marshes have been ditched. Ditching was largely abandoned by the mid-twentieth century; however, techniques that create permanent shallow water pools for mosquito control and bird habitat are increasingly being applied to marshes of the USA and elsewhere. Salt marshes in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were used to examine differences between areas that have been ditched and those altered to increase the density of shallow pools in water table dynamics, salinity, soil and porewater chemistry, as well as short-term sedimentation, accretion, and elevation change rates. We found that the area with plugged ditches, berms, and pools in Plum Island had less drainage, higher salinity and porewater sulfide and ammonium concentrations, and higher soil organic matter than the adjacent ditched area. Despite averaging 8 cm lower in elevation, the Plum Island ditched area had less sediment deposition and was composed of higher elevation plant species than the area with plugged ditches, berms, and shallow pools. Elevation increased in the ditched area at a rate of 3.2 +/- A 0.5 mm/year, but elevation change was variable in the area with pools. In Barnegat Bay, the marsh area with pools and ditches had less sediment deposition and surface accretion than the ditch-only area, associated, in part, with the higher elevation. An average elevation difference of 4.5 cm was associated with a sixfold difference in mineral sediment deposition. Temporal sediment deposition and surface accretion was important in the ditch-only area but was absent or muted in the area with numerous pools. Elevation increased in both marsh areas at an average rate of 1.8 +/- A 0.8 mm/year, less than half the long-term average local rate of sea-level rise. Our results illustrate how physical manipulations including changes to tidal hydrology and surface topography interact with elevation to influence short-term biophysical feedbacks.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling in plant and soil subsystems is driven by changes in soil salinity following coastal embankment in typical coastal saltmarsh ecosystems of Eastern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, coastal land reclamation through the use of embankments has increased worldwide, and its impacts on ecosystem processes and functionality have been widely reported. However, the ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling turnover processes following the establishment of coastal embankments remain unknown. For this study, we investigated stocks of various types of N in soils, N storage in plant subsystems, the microbial immobilization and mineralization of N, as well as soil physiochemical properties in embanked and adjacent unembanked Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis saltmarshes in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal embankments in a S. alterniflora saltmarsh significantly decreased the total plant N storage by 50.24%, concentrations of total soil organic N (SON) by 55.16%, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) by 32.33%, nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N) by 41.23%, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) by 13.38%, and the value of soil net ammonification (RA) by 83.49%. However, in P. australis saltmarshes they significantly increased the total plant N storage by 160.24%, concentrations of SON by 57.28%, NH4-N by 7.89%, NO2-N by 101.76%, NO3-N by 32.05%, and the value of RA by 392.95%. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in N cycling following the establishment of coastal embankments in S. salsa saltmarshes. Significant changes in the organic and inorganic soil N pools of S. alterniflora and P. australis saltmarshes were driven by plant residue inputs, which were significantly affected by decreasing soil salinity in these coastal wetlands. Furthermore, our results indicated that coastal embankments altered the immobilization of soil N and mineralization of microorganisms by influencing the growth and activities of soil microbes, which were primarily associated with changes in soil organic and inorganic N pools following the development of coastal embankments. In summary, alterations in the organic N inputs of plants were initiated by the dramatically decreased soil salinity, which was the main determinant that drove N cycling in the soil subsystems of coastal wetlands subsequent to the establishment of coastal embankments.

TI  - Nonlinear responses in salt marsh functioning to increased nitrogen addition
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide storm protection to shorelines, sequester carbon (C), and mitigate coastal eutrophication. These valuable coastal ecosystems are confronted with increasing nitrogen (N) inputs from anthropogenic sources, such as agricultural runoff, wastewater, and atmospheric deposition. To inform predictions of salt marsh functioning and sustainability in the future, we characterized the response of a variety of plant, microbial, and sediment responses to a seven-level gradient of N addition in three Californian salt marshes after 7 and 14 months of N addition. The marshes showed variable responses to the experimental N gradient that can be grouped as neutral (root biomass, sediment respiration, potential carbon mineralization, and potential net nitrification), linear (increasing methane flux, decreasing potential net N mineralization, and increasing sediment inorganic N), and nonlinear (saturating aboveground plant biomass and leaf N content, and exponentially increasing sediment inorganic and organic N). The three salt marshes showed quantitative differences in most ecosystem properties and processes rates; however, the form of the response curves to N addition were generally consistent across the three marshes, indicating that the responses observed may be applicable to other marshes in the region. Only for sediment properties (inorganic and organic N pool) did the shape of the response differ significantly between marshes. Overall, the study suggests salt marshes are limited in their ability to sequester C and N with future increases in N, even without further losses in marsh area.

TI  - Sediment Suspension and Elevation Loss Triggered by Atlantic Mud Fiddler Crab (Uca pugnax) Bioturbation in Salt Marsh Dieback Areas of Southern New England
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of bioturbation on sediment suspension and elevation loss by the Atlantic mud fiddler crab, Uca pugnax (Smith), were investigated in this study. High densities of U. pugnax occur in unvegetated areas of Cape Cod salt marshes that have been denuded by the herbivorous Sesarma reticulatum (purple marsh crab). The hypothesis addressed in this study is that U. pugnax then causes sediment suspension and subsequent erosion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that unlike vegetated zones sediments are rapidly eroding from dieback areas, but the various mechanisms by which this is occurring are unclear. In this study, we focused on the role that U. pugnax might play in this process through experiments that assessed sediment suspension during rainfall events and flooding tides, as well as elevation changes. The results indicate that U. pugnax contributes to elevated sediment loads in the water column and that the suspended sediment is transported elsewhere, resulting in elevation lowering. The loss of vegetation through S. reticulatum herbivory has resulted in a cascading series of events, with one of the consequences being an elevated potential for sediment mobilization and erosion by U. pugnax bioturbation. This has consequences for vegetation recovery and overall marsh resiliency.

TI  - Responses of coastal wetlands to rising sea level
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh ecosystems are maintained by the dominant macrophytes that regulate the elevation of their habitat within a narrow portion of the intertidal zone by accumulating organic matter and trapping inorganic sediment. The long-term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level, land elevation, primary production, and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long-period cycles of sea level, and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity. We describe a theoretical model that predicts that the system will be stable against changes in relative mean sea level when surface elevation is greater than what is optimal for primary production. When surface elevation is less than optimal, the system will be unstable. The model predicts that there is an optimal rate of RSLR at which the equilibrium elevation and depth of tidal flooding will be optimal for plant growth However, the optimal rate of RSLR also represents an upper limit because at higher rates of RSLR the plant community cannot sustain an elevation that is within its range of tolerance. For estuaries with high sediment loading, such as those on the southeast coast of the United States, the limiting rate of RSLR was predided to be at most 1.2 cm/yr, which is 3.5 times greater than the current, long-term rate of RSLR.

TI  - Sediment accretion rates from four coastal wetlands along the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study of sediment accretion rates from four low tidal-range sites along the Gulf of Mexico does not support previous hypotheses concerning the relationship between tidal range and vertical accretion rates. The addition of our data to an earlier data set decreased the correlation between these variables, and all but one of our low-tidal range sites had positive accretion rates, contradicting previous studies which have predicted that low tidal-range sites would have negative net accretion rates. Additionally, in transects across the marsh, accretion rates decreased from low- to high-marsh stations; however, this appeared to be caused by changes in rates of organic matter accumulation, not mineral matter accumulation, as has been proposed in previous studies. Vertical accretion rates were more strongly correlated with organic matter accumulation rates than mineral matter accumulation rates, confirming previous studies which indicated the important role of sediment organic matter in determining sediment structure. These results do not imply that mineral matter is unimportant in maintaining the elevation of the marsh; mineral matter input affects organic matter production and sediment bulk density. There was little correlation between mineral and organic matter accumulation rates, with average organic matter accumulation rates for each site having little variation compared to the variation in mineral matter accumulation rates. This result supports a previous hypothesis that there may be a limit to annual rates of organic matter accumulation. Finally, the study indicates that the negative net accretion rates documented in Louisiana are not typical of other Gulf coast wetlands.

TI  - Data from: Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks      in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes      in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change      factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However,      little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on      organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The      present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large      herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This      was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and      indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of      two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We      assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as      well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric      assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the      microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently      increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore      potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and      sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily      driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant      autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine)      sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a      novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down      control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of      allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the      structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the      first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and      thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of      enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of      enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing.      It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as      hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is      plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level      understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and      biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and      predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed      and ungrazed systems.

M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus (P) release from wetland soils to overlying waters is important to consider when restoring wetland hydrology Soil physicochemical characteristics influence P dynamics between underlying soil and overlying water Our study initially characterized wetland and surrounding upland soils prior to flooding Deep marsh wetland soils had greater moisture content, soil organic matter, nitrogen (N). P. and lower bulk density than surrounding upland pasture soils, which indicates a nutrient concentration gradient between wetland and upland soils To determine the short-term P dynamics between soils and overlying water, we conducted four laboratory soil water cote studies during a 15-month period Surface soils (0-10 cm) collected October 2005, February 2006, October 2006 and December 2006 from wetlands and their surrounding uplands within cow-calf grazed pastures were flooded for 7 clays, and we measured P release from soil to overlying water Phosphorus release rates from wetland (deep marsh and shallow marsh) and upland soils were similar Values ranged between -20 mg m(-2) d(-1) (retention) and 77 mg m(-2) d(-1) (release) There was a significant, although weak, negative linear relationship between P release nom deep marsh soils and hydroperiod Thus, it may be important for land managers to consider increasing hydroperiod of wetland soils to decrease P release and increase retention In addition, there was a significant negative exponential relationship between P release and days since deep marsh soil inundation This suggests that to decrease P release from soils, soils should be wet rather than dry for prolonged periods, prior to flooding We found significant relationships between P release from upland soils and their nutrient content (N, P and carbon) Reducing nutrient content in upland soils may help reduce the magnitude of P release from soil (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI  - MODELLING THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE ON THE GROWTH OF SALT MARSH PLANTS
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gradual increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have resulted from the increased human use of fossil fuels since the beginning of industrial activity. In coastal wetland ecosystems, salt marshes constitute important habitats because they play important ecological roles, acting as carbon sinks by capturing atmospheric CO2 and storing it in living plant tissue. Ecological models are important tools for understanding the results of anthropogenic impacts on a global scale. Global warming poses threats to salt marshes through different effects, e.g., increases in sea level. The objectives of this study were i) to assess how temperature increases will influence the growth of salt marsh plants, ii) to infer the carbon budget of salt marshes under temperature increase scenarios and iii) to predict how salt marsh plants will keep pace with increases in sea level. These goals were achieved by developing growth models of three different plants (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus and Zostera noltei) found in the Mondego estuary. Models were developed for C-3 and C-4 plant species. The results suggest that a temperature increase enhances the aboveground biomass of salt marsh plants. According to the predictions of the models, the sedimentation rate of S. maritima and Z. noltei can keep pace with increases in sea level, but this is apparently not the case for S. maritimus. If S. maritimus disappears from the Mondego estuary, the carbon sequestration ability of the system should decrease due to the loss of active plant tissue. This conclusion is based on the fact that S. maritimus accumulated more than 80% of the total carbon sequestered in the tissues by the three studied species.

TI  - Using Isotopic Measures of Connectivity and Ecosystem Capacity to Compare Restoring and Natural Marshes in the Skokomish River Estuary, WA, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine detritus-based food webs typically rely on diverse sources and timing of organic matter (OM) delivery. Access to detritus requires adequate hydraulic connectivity for consumer migration into productive locations and the transfer of allochthonous detritus into consumer habitats. These processes are particularly important to the patterns and rates of community development in restoring estuarine marshes where OM sources and connectivity might vary as a function of landscape setting. This study quantifies trophic dynamics in restoring and natural marsh ecosystems in the Skokomish estuary, Washington, USA, using Pacific blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus), stable isotopes, and a Bayesian multiple source mixing model to estimate available suspended food resources. The restoring marshes represent different ages since restoration implementation-14 and 3 years-as well as different restoration approaches-a levee breach and a full levee removal. Sestonic OM was less available and of lower quality in the two restoring marshes than in the natural marsh site. Mussel diets tracked seasonal trends in OM availability: Phytoplankton consumption was highest in spring, marsh detritus consumption was highest in winter (but consistently comprised at least 30 % of OM assimilated by mussels), and macroalgae consumption was highest in September. Trophic equivalency with mussels inhabiting the natural marsh appears to be restoring more rapidly in the younger restoration site, perhaps because increased hydrologic connectivity achieved through full levee removal promotes greater OM exchange compared to the single levee breach restoration approach. We conclude that increasing ecosystem capacity for detritus production by restoring emergent marsh ecosystems can bolster support for detritus-based food webs and suggest that restoration actions enhancing connectivity may achieve functional equivalency more rapidly than restoration projects exhibiting limited connectivity to the surrounding landscape.

TI  - Vegetation Change in Salt Marshes of Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) Between 1984 and 2013
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation patterns in salt marshes are largely based on elevation in relation to tidal flooding. In New England salt marshes, vegetation is distinctly zoned into species that occur in the high marsh (elevations above mean high tide) vs. those that reside in the low marsh (elevations below mean high tide). The extent and distribution of these species is responsive to changes in hydrology, particularly sea level rise. In this study, six salt marshes within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS) were analyzed using a GIS-based mapping approach that utilized aerial images from 1984 and 2013. The results indicate that there have been highly variable amounts of change among marshes. There have been substantial losses of high marsh vegetation (> 190 acres in total), while low marsh vegetation has exhibited large gains in some marshes and relatively minor losses in others with a total net gain of > 131 acres. Because sea level rise appears to be outpacing vertical accretion, higher water levels in the near future could result in large vegetation shifts, which would translate to significant changes in marsh structure and function.

TI  - Commodity Consistent Meta-Analysis of Wetland Values: An Illustration for Coastal Marsh Habitat
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior meta-regression models (MRMs) of wetland values pool value estimates associated with diverse commodity types-for example recreation, flood control, nutrient cycling, habitat provision, nonuse value, and carbon sequestration. Neither theory nor economic intuition justify the inclusion of such dissimilar commodities within a single meta-analytic value function, leading to validity concerns. This article seeks to advance methods for commodity and welfare consistent MRMs, applied to a particular category of wetland values. We develop a wetland value MRM restricted to a specific wetland type (coastal marshes), general location (US and Canada), commodity type (habitat provision and services), and valuation approach (stated preference methods). Results indicate that willingness to pay per household for marsh habitat changes is responsive to scope, spatial scale, market extent, the type of habitat change, household characteristics, and other factors suggested by theory and intuition. Results supersede those of prior wetland value MRMs in terms of statistical performance, estimation of anticipated value surface patterns, and capacity to support conceptually valid benefit transfers. Comparison with an otherwise identical but less commodity consistent MRM demonstrates that commodity consistency leads to improved statistical and benefit transfer performance.

TI  - Salt marsh-atmosphere exchange of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide: Effects of tidal flooding and biophysical controls
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which short-duration, transient floods modify wetland-atmosphere exchange of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide (CO2) is poorly documented despite the significance of flooding in many wetlands. This study explored the effects of transient floods on salt marsh-atmosphere linkages. Eddy flux, micrometeorological, and other field data collected during two tidal phases (daytime versus nighttime high tides) quantified the salt marsh radiation budget, surface energy balance, and CO2 flux. Analysis contrasted flooded and nonflooded and day and night effects. The salt marsh surface energy balance was similar to that of a heating-dominated sparse crop during nonflooded periods but similar to that of an evaporative cooling-dominated, well-watered grassy lawn during flooding. Observed increases in latent heat flux and decreases in net ecosystem exchange during flooding were proportional to flood depth and duration, with complete CO2 flux suppression occurring above some flood height less than the canopy height. Flood-induced changes in the salt marsh energy balance were dominated by changes in sensible heat flux, soil heat flux, and surface water heat storage. Parameters suitable for predicting the salt marsh surface energy balance were obtained by calibrating common models (e.g., Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor, and pan coefficient). Biophysical controls on salt marsh-atmosphere exchange were identified following calibration of models describing the coupling of canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in the salt marsh. The effects of flooding on salt marsh-atmosphere exchange are temporary but strongly affect the marsh water, carbon, and energy balance despite their short duration.

TI  - Fifty-five years of soil development in restored freshwater depressional wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetland restoration is increasingly used as a strategy both to address historical wetland losses and to mitigate new wetland impacts. Research has examined the success of restored wetlands for avifaunal habitat, plant biodiversity, and plant cover; however, less is known about soil development in these systems. Soil processes are particularly important as soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and other properties are directly linked to wetland functions such as water quality improvement. This research compared soil development processes and properties of 30 palustrine depressional wetlands of four different age classes (similar to 5, 14, 35, and 55 years since restoration) located in central New York (USA). Five natural wetlands were used as references. This chronosequence included wetlands 27 years older than previously conducted studies, making it the longest reported database available. Replicated soil cores from each site were analyzed for SOM, bulk density (D-b), CEC, and concentrations of nutrients and other chemical constituents. Decomposition rate and aboveground plant and litter biomass were measured as key contributors to soil development. The results indicate that some soil properties critical for water quality functions take decades or centuries to reach natural reference levels. Of particular importance, in the top five centimeters of soil, SOM, D-b, and CEC achieved <50% of reference levels 55 years after restoration. Soil development processes in these depressional wetlands appear to be driven by autochthonous inputs and by internal processes such as litter decomposition and are not accelerated in the initial phase of development by allochthonous inputs as has been documented in coastal salt marshes and riverine floodplains. While monitoring generally focuses on the initial establishment phase of restored ecosystems, our findings indicate that the later autogenic phase strongly influences development trajectories for important wetland soil properties. Therefore, the role of different successional phases in determining long-term trajectories of ecosystem development should be considered in restoration design, research, and monitoring. This research highlights areas for improving the field of restoration through understanding of successional processes, increased efforts to jump-start soil development, longer-term monitoring programs, and greater focus on soil components of restored wetlands.

TI  - Effects of De-Embankment on Pore Water Geochemistry of Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes form part of the widely distributed intertidal landscape. The salt marshes of the East Frisian barrier island Langeoog (NW Germany) belong to the barrier-connected salt marsh type and were protected by a summer dike that was removed in 2004. In this study, pore water and sediment data were combined to investigate the effects of the de-embankment along a transect including sites on seawater-influenced grassland, high and low salt marsh, and transition zone tidal flat-low salt marsh. Pore waters were sampled with in situ pore water samplers for 13 mo and analysed for trace metals (Fe, Mn), nutrients (NH4+, PO43-), dissolved organic carbon, and sulphate. Additionally, on site measurements of pH and salinity were carried out. Pore water ultrafiltration experiments with 5000 Da MWCO (molecular weight cut off) complemented the water analyses. Sediment samples were taken from hammer corings and were analysed for bulk parameters (total carbon [TC], total inorganic carbon [TIC], total organic carbon [TOC], total sulphur [TS]) and selected major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mn). Additionally, reactive iron and manganese were analysed.Sediments along the study transect are characterised by quartz dominance and very low TC (TOC and TIC) and TS contents. The iron content is comparable to other salt marsh sediments. The high percentage of reactive iron (up to 40%) indicates that salt marsh sediments form an important iron source for pore waters, as confirmed by high pore water concentrations of dissolved iron (up to 583 mu M). Dissolved iron in pore waters most likely results from reduction and dissolution of oxidised iron minerals by organic ligands or Fe(II) organic complexes. Iron complexation by humic substances and siderophores in combination with circum-neutral pH values keep iron in solution. Therefore, the studied salt marshes presumably form an important iron reservoir, which may account for elevated pyrite contents frequently observed in Holocene coastal peats.Flooding of the salt marsh during a storm surge resulted in a considerable increase in pore water iron (8-fold), manganese (21-fold), phosphate (5-fold), and ammonia (7-fold) concentrations. These results show that seawater restoration (de-embankment) should be handled very carefully, especially with regard to nutrient release and subsequent changes in pore water quality.

TI  - How do Elevated CO2 and Nitrogen Addition Affect Functional Microbial Community Involved in Greenhouse Gas Flux in Salt Marsh System
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are unique ecosystem of which a microbial community is expected to be affected by global climate change. In this study, by using T-RFLP analysis, quantitative PCR, and pyrosequencing, we comprehensively analyzed the microbial community structure responding to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and N addition in a salt marsh ecosystem subjected to CO2 manipulation and N addition for about 3 years. We focused on the genes of microbes relevant to N-cycling (denitrification and nitrification), CH4-flux (methanogens and methanotrophs), and S-cycling (sulfate reduction) considering that they are key functional groups involved in the nutrient cycle of salt marsh system. Overall, this study suggests that (1) eCO(2) and N addition affect functional microbial community involved in greenhouse gas flux in salt marsh system. Specifically, the denitrification process may be facilitated, while the methanogenesis may be impeded due to the outcompeting of sulfate reduction by eCO(2) and N. This implies that future global change may cause a probable change in GHGs flux and positive feedback to global climate change in salt marsh; (2) the effect of eCO(2) and N on functional group seems specific and to contrast with each other, but the effect of single factor would not be compromised but complemented by combination of two factors. (3) The response of functional groups to eCO(2) and/or N may be directly or indirectly related to the plant community and its response to eCO(2) and/or N. This study provides new insights into our understanding of functional microbial community responses to eCO(2) and/or N addition in a C3/C4 plant mixed salt marsh system.

TI  - Carbon sequestration is not inhibited by livestock grazing in Danish salt marshes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change has created a need for solutions that can counteract greenhouse gas emissions. One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled "blue carbon ecosystems" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.

We assessed SOC stocks and fractions in temperate mangrove (two sites) and saltmarsh (sites SM1, SM2 and SM3) environments in southern Australia. The SOC fractions were separated according to particulate organic carbon (POC), humic carbon (HC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) by size fractionation. Saltmarsh sites generally had the highest SOC content (up to 12.4% SOC). The POC fraction was the highest at the surface in the saltmarsh site and decreased relative to the HC and RC fractions with depth. Conversely, the proportion of POC at the mangrove sites did not decrease with depth, forming up to 76% of the SOC. The vertical displacement of soil of up to 5.8 mm year(-1) at the saltmarsh sites, measured using root ingrowth bags, suggest significant contributions of POC via root materials. Retention of these POC inputs are likely to be related to waterlogging, which decreases decomposition rates - with much lower soil moisture content at SM1, where the lowest POC content occurred below the surface, compared with SM2 and SM3.

TI  - Seawall construction alters soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics and soil microbial biomass in an invasive Spartina alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawalls have increasingly been constructed to control the invasion of an exotic perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, in coastal wetlands of eastern China. We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Does invasion of Spartina alterniflora alter microhabitats and benthic communities of salt marshes in Yangtze River estuary?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has rapidly spread in salt marshes of Yangtze River estuary. However, there is no consistent pattern on the effects of S. alterniflora invasions on microhabitats and benthic communities. The study first compared vegetation, water velocity, sediment deposition rate, sediment properties and benthic communities between invasive S. alterniflora and native Scirpus mariqueter patches using a pair-wise sampling design at 3 sites (Dongtan, Jiuduansha and Nanhui) in four seasons. The stands of S. alterniflora exhibited taller and less dense shoots, greater aboveground biomass and longer phenological phase than did S. mariqueter. S. alterniflora marshes had significantly lower water velocity, greater sediment deposition rates and higher light attenuation relative to S. mariqueter habitats. In general, sediment temperature, salinity, porosity, organic carbon content and microalgal biomass (Chla) did not significantly differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats at any of 3 sites. Thirty-four of 37 macrofauna species recorded did not exhibit density differences between habitat types. Limited influences on macrofauna were evident only at Dongtan where S. alterniflora marshes had significantly greater gastropod densities in the autumn. In 8 of 12 observations, benthic community structure did not differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats. It was concluded that the differences in physical structure were not enough to significantly change sediment properties, macrofaunal density and community structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Salt marshes as a source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to Southern California coastal waters
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sources in Southern California coastal waters, optical properties of a river outlet and adjacent tidally flushed salt marshes were monitored (dry season; June July 2001). Average absorption coefficients doubled at ebb vs. flood tides (4.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 m(-1); 300 nm), suggesting significant salt marsh CDOM inputs into coastal waters. Average spectral slopes were not statistically different for any sites or tides (0.010 +/- 0.002 nm(-1)), consistent with salt marsh CDOM dominating coastal waters. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) at ebb tide showed contributions from terrestrial, protein, and marine humic-like peaks, suggesting production and output of these materials from the marsh. A marine humic signal at the river outlet during an offshore upwelling event indicated an additional sporadic nonmarsh marine humic-like source. EEMs of six common salt marsh plant leachates showed protein, terrestrial, and marine humic-like peaks. To estimate CDOM photodegradation in the marsh, fluorescence intensity decays from photobleaching experiments were fit to first-order kinetics. Most humic peaks degraded with a half-life of t(1/2) = 10-20 h, which overlaps the estimated residence time of water in the marshes (similar to 12 h). Most protein peaks were resistant to photodegradation, suggesting that the low levels of protein vs. humic-like material measured in natural waters was due to rapid bioutilization of proteinaceous material. The rapid photodegradation of plant leachate humic material and the low spectral slopes for the field sites suggest that marsh sediments would be an important source of CDOM.

TI  - The greenhouse gas flux and potential global warming feedbacks of a northern macrotidal and microtidal salt marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of wetlands by drainage for agriculture or other anthropogenic activities could have a negative or positive feedback to global warming (GWF). We suggest that a major predictor of the GWF is salinity of the wetland soil (a proxy for available sulfate), a factor often ignored in other studies. We assess the radiative balance of two northern salt marshes with average soil salinities > 20 ppt, but with high (macro-) and low (micro-) tidal amplitudes. The flux of greenhouse gases from soils at the end of the growing season averaged 485 +/- 253 mg m(-2) h(-1), 13 +/- 30 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 19 +/- 58 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the microtidal marsh and 398 +/- 201 mg m(-2) h(-1), 2 +/- 26 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 35 +/- 77 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the macrotidal marsh for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. High rates of C sequestration mean that loss of these marshes would have a radiative balance of -981CO(2-)eq. m(-2) yr(-1) in the microtidal and -567CO(2-)eq.m(-2)yr(-1) in the macrotidal marsh.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Salt marshes are under increasing anthropogenic pressures that have been reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis, which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the summer of 2010 in four creeks from two sites from Western France (the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay and the Seine Estuary). Analysis was undertaken using C and N stable-isotope compositions. Tested response variables (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase in the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays, with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea bass and the thinlip mullet was unchanged by local salt-marsh vegetation, and considered consistent with their diet. This study highlights the relevance of stable-isotopes analyses for assessing long-term and integrative effects of changes in vegetation resulting from human disturbances in salt marshes.

TI  - Denitrification potential of Cyperus malaccensis marsh soil in Minjiang River estuary of East China
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - By using submerged anaerobic incubation method, this paper studied the soil denitrification rate, denitrification ratio (denitrifying activity) and its contribution to the soil nitrogen loss in Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the Minjiang River estuary of East China. The denitrification rate in different soil layers varied with incubation time in first-order exponential decay model (R-2 >= 0.90), and was the maximum in 5-10 cm soil layer. The denitrifying activity in different soil layers increased gradually over time, and was the highest (93.92%) in 5-10 cm soil layer. The nitrogen loss rate in different soil layers was in accordance with the denitrification rate and denitrifying activity. The contribution rate of denitrification to the nitrogen loss was higher in upper soil layers than in deeper soil layers. The differences in the denitrification rate and denitrifying activity in each soil layer were related to the soil physical and chemical properties, being positively correlated with soil pH and the contents of soil clay, organic matter, NO3--N, and WHC, but negatively correlated with soil sand content.

TI  - Dataset: Use of lead isotopes for developing chronologies in recent salt-marsh sediments
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Dating of recent salt-marsh sediments is hindered by the radiocarbon plateau and the moving 10 year window of 21p less than 0.b accumulation histories. Introduction of anthropogenic Pb to the environment is a means to date salt-marsh sediment deposited over the last 20 years by correlating downcore changes in concentration and isotopic ratios to historical production and consumption. We investigated use of Pb as a chronometer in a core of salt-marsh sediment from New Jersey, USA. Changes in Pb concentration identified horizons at AD 1875, 1925, 1935 and 1974 that correspond to features of historic U.S Pb production and consumption. Stable lead isotopes (2p less than 0.Pb:2p less than 0.Pb) constrained ages at AD 1827, 1857 and 1880 reflecting Pb production in the Upper Mississippi Valley with its unusual isotopic signature and at AD 1965 and 198p less than 0.from leaded gasoline. Confirmatory evidence for the gasoline horizons came from increased Sb concentrations caused by vehicle emissions and industrial activity. These nine chronostratigraphic markers of fixed dates provide precise constraints on sediment age in the northeastern USA and enable salt-marsh records of coastal evolution and wetland development to extend beyond the period of instrumental measurements.

TI  - A one-dimensional biomorphodynamic model of tidal flats: Sediment sorting, marsh distribution, and carbon accumulation under sea level rise
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a biomorphodynamic model to investigate sediment and vegetation dynamics on a schematic intertidal flat characterized by an initially well-mixed sand-mud mixture. Major interactions between tides, wind waves, salt marshes, sediment transport and sea level rise (SLR) are taken into account. For a bare flat under only tidal action, the model predicts a convex cross-shore profile with the surficial distribution of mud and sand on the upper and lower part of the intertidal flat, respectively. When wind waves are strong, the intertidal flat is highly eroded resulting in a concave profile near the high water mark. This behavior is pronouncedly altered when the intertidal flat is vegetated with the presence of salt marshes. Numerical results suggest that a considerable amount of mud can still remain in the vegetated region even when wave action is strong. A steeper transition zone forms at the boundary between salt marshes and bare flats because of the differential sediment deposition in the two neighboring regions. The inclusion of wind waves is found to considerably enhance the size of the marsh-edge transition zone. For the numerical experiments designed in this study, the profile shape and sediment sorting behavior of tidal flats are not significantly modified by a gradual rising sea level. However, the impacts of SLR on vegetated tidal flats are still manifold: (a) driving the landward migration of intertidal zone and salt marshes; (b) enhancing sediment erosion on intertidal flats; and (c) drowning salt marshes under limited sediment supply with the constrain of seawalls. Finally, model results suggest that organic carbon accumulation on marshlands may be enhanced with an increasing SLR rate provided that salt marshes are not drowned. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OF A SANDBAR EMERGENT TIDAL MARSH, ALTAMAHA RIVER ESTUARY, GEORGIA, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation structure and soil properties were measured on a sandbar, a three year old sandbar emergent marsh (SEM). and five mature Spartina alterniflora Loisel marshes located near the mouth of the Altamaha River (Georgia, USA) to determine flow quickly tidal marsh vegetation and soils develop during primary succession. Those data were compared to published data collected from young (10-16 yr old) natural marshes in Virginia and young (1-28 yr old) constructed marshes in North Carolina to determine if the rate of ecosystem development is similar among, tidal marshes of the southeastern US Coast. Within three years of emergence, aboveground biomass of SEM was comparable to mature marshes in the area, although stem height mid density were distinctly different as the SEM contained more stems that were of shorter height than mature marshes. Following, colonization by vegetation, soil properties (0 30 cm) of SEM had begun to differentiate from sediments of the sandbar. Surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-30 cm) soil bulk density was less. mid organic carbon (C). nitrogen (N) mid percent sill (0-10 cm) were greater in sediments of SEM than ill the sandbar. Even so. soils of SEM contained less organic C, N. silt, and clay than mature marshes. However. accumulation rates of organic C (260 +/- 40 g m (2) yr(-1)) and N (11 +/- 3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) in soils of SEM was 5 to 7 times greater than in mature marshes (35 +/- 4 C m(-2) yr(-1), 2 +/- 0.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) Trajectories of development for Soil organic C and N Pools were similar for our SEM, young natural S. alterniflora marshes in Virginia, and young constructed S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina suggesting, that Soil development proceeds at similar rates for tidal marshes along, much of the southeast US Coast.

TI  - Climate Drivers of Spartina alterniflora Saltmarsh Production in Georgia, USA
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are threatened by global changes related not only to sea level rise but also to altered weather patterns. To predict consequences of these changes on coastal communities, it is necessary to understand how temporally varying abiotic conditions drive wetland production. In 2000-2011, we conducted annual surveys of Spartina alterniflora biomass in tidal marshes at nine sites in and around the Altamaha river estuary on the coast of Georgia, USA. End of the year live biomass was assessed in the creekbank and midmarsh zones to estimate annual net primary production (ANPP). River discharge was the most important driver of S. alterniflora ANPP, especially in creekbank vegetation. Increased river discharge reduces water column salinity, and this was most likely the proximate driver of increased production. In the midmarsh zone, the patterns were less distinct, although river discharge was again the best predictor, but maximum temperature had similar predictive ability. In contrast to results from terrestrial grasslands, we found no consistent evidence for a sharply delimited critical period for any climate driver in the tidal marsh, which indicates that plant growth was responsive to abiotic drivers at any time during the growing season. Results were broadly consistent across multiple sites within a geographic region. Our results differ from previous analyses of production in S. alterniflora marshes, which either identified oceanic drivers of S. alterniflora production or were unable to identify any drivers, likely because the low-latitude sites we studied were hotter and more affected by river discharge than those in previous studies.

TI  - The use of chlorate, nitrate, and perchlorate to promote crude oil mineralization in salt marsh sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the high volume of crude oil released by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the salt marshes along the gulf coast were contaminated with crude oil. Biodegradation of crude oil in salt marshes is primarily limited by oxygen availability due to the high organic carbon content of the soil, high flux rate of S2-, and saturated conditions. Chlorate, nitrate, and perchlorate were evaluated for use as electron acceptors in comparison to oxygen by comparing oil transformation and mineralization in mesocosms consisting of oiled salt marsh sediment from an area impacted by the BP Horizon oil spill. Mineralization rates were determined by measuring CO2 production and delta C-13 of the produced CO2 and compared to transformation evaluated by measuring the alkane/hopane ratios over a 4-month period. Total alkane/hopane ratios decreased (similar to 55-70 %) for all treatments in the following relative order: aerated approximate to chlorate > nitrate > perchlorate. Total CO2 produced was similar between treatments ranging from 550-700 mg CO2-C. The delta C-13-CO2 values generally ranged between the indigenous carbon and oil values (-17 and -27%, respectively). Oil mineralization was greatest for the aerated treatments and least for the perchlorate amended. Our results indicate that chlorate has a similar potential as oxygen to support oil mineralization in contaminated salt marshes, but nitrate and perchlorate were less effective. The use of chlorate as a means to promote oil mineralization in situ may be a promising means to remediate contaminated salt marshes while preventing unwanted secondary impacts related to nutrient management as in the case of nitrate amendments.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity: One of the driving factors of plant communities in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in regional and even continental sustainable development because of their valuable ecosystem services. The coupling mechanism among hydrology, edaphic factors, and vegetation is the key to coastal wetland management. The current study conducted in the Yellow River Delta used an improved-comprehensive hydrological connectivity structure index, Topographic Over Field Capacity Index (TOFCI), based on both soil water conditions (SWC) and topography to highlight the role of hydrological connectivity on intertidal flat (IF), tidal marsh (TM), semi-artificial pond (AP) and riverside intermittent flooded (RS) wetland classes among other environmental variables. The results showed plant community distributions and structures among wetland classes differed from each other significantly, and hydrological connectivity structure is one of the driving factors. The results provided three pieces of evidence for this inference: 1) according to PCA results, the contribution of TOFCI is the highest among all environmental variables; 2) TOFCI values show significant difference among different plant communities; 3) TOFCI is also significantly correlated to species composition and distribution according to the CCA and RDA results. TOFCI values are positively linearly correlated to the plant coverage and biomass in intertidal flat wetlands according to linear regression analysis. Furthermore, salinity, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus also influence plant community distribution and species composition. Finally, simple parameters for soil water conditions or topographic characteristics do not show significant explanatory power to hydrology-vegetation interaction. The results of the current study provide a new perspective for coastal wetland conservation and restoration.

TI  - Sensitivity of US Gulf of Mexico coastal marsh vegetation to crude oil: Comparison of greenhouse and field responses
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of crude oil on selected US Gulf of Mexico coastal marsh species. Species showed different levels of sensitivity to oiling between greenhouse and field conditions. In greenhouse studies, two crude oils were used: South Louisiana crude oil (SLC) and Arabian Medium crude oil (AMC). The majority of Spartina patens plants died within one month following oiling with little or no recovery after three months. Panicum hemitomon and Spartina alterniflora were also adversely affected by oiling under greenhouse conditions but to a lesser extent than S. patens. The SLC or AMC oiling led to biomass reductions in S. alterniflora and S. patens. The dry biomass was not affected by oiling in P. hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, Typha latifolia, and Scirpus olneyi. Results showed that S. patens plants were more sensitive to SLC as compared to AMC oil. Gross CO2-C fixation data collected in the greenhouse indicated no differences in recovery among species across oiling treatments for S. lancifolia, S. olneyi, and T. latifolia. Field studies with S. alterniflora, S. patens and S. lancifolia demonstrated initial sensitivity of these species to oiling, and recovery following oiling with SLC. Our data also showed that caution must be employed whenever results from greenhouse studies are extrapolated to predict oil impact on vegetation under field conditions. Development of any sensitivity index of plant responses to oiling should not be based on greenhouse experiments only. Field evaluations should be included which best depict plant responses to oiling. Thus, restoration measures of US Gulf of Mexico coastal marshes following oiling should rely primarily on field studies. The field research suggests that the US Gulf of Mexico coastal marsh vegetation are likely to recover from oil spills naturally without the need for remediation procedures.

TI  - The model high molecular weight DOC compound, dextran, is ingested by the benthic ciliate Uronema marinum but does not supplement ciliate growth
T2  - AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phagotrophic ciliates are capable of growth solely on dissolved compounds in laboratory cultures. Whether ciliates use dissolved compounds in the environment for growth is unclear. We investigated the ability of the marine benthic ciliate Uronema marinum to ingest a model high molecular weight dissolved organic carbon (HMW-DOC) compound, dextran, at concentrations typical for coastal salt marsh sediments (3 mu M to 3 mM C). Ingestion was measured by incubating ciliates with fluorescein-labeled dextran (2000 kDa) and measuring the fluorescence signal of the labeled compound in cells via flow cytometry. Ciliates accumulated dextran (relative to formalin-killed controls) at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg l(-1) dextran (3 mu M C). Labeled dextran accumulated in food vacuoles and near the buccal cavity; thus, the ingestion of dextran appears to be a consequence of feeding activities rather than transport across the cell membrane via parasomal sac formation. Dextran accumulation did not increase with higher bacterial ingestion rates. Instead, dextran accumulation was greatest at intermediate bacterial concentrations and grazing rates. Ciliate growth rates were measured in treatments amended with model carbon compounds-soluble starch, acetate, and glucose (3 mM C, final concentrations). There was no significant increase in ciliate growth rates with these compounds in either bacteria-free or bacteria-enriched treatments. Rather, growth rates were significantly lower in treatments with DOC addition, indicating that processing of these DOC compounds may incur some energetic cost to these ciliates.

TI  - Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance in a North Carolina, USA, Salt Marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes have among the highest carbon (C) burial rates of any ecosystem and often rely on C accumulation to gain elevation and persist in locations with accelerating sea level rise. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), the accumulation or loss of C resulting from vertical CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes, lateral C fluxes, and sediment C inputs, varies across salt marshes; thus, extrapolation of NECB to an entire marsh is challenging. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to salt marshes impact NECB by influencing each component of NECB, but differences in the impacts of fertilization between edge and interior marsh must be considered when scaling up. NECB was estimated for the 0.5 km(2) Spartina alterniflora marsh area of Freeman Creek, NC, under control and fertilized conditions at both interior and edge berm sites. Annual CO2 fluxes were nearly balanced at control sites, but fertilization significantly increased net CO2 emissions at edge sites. Lateral C export, modeled using respiration rates, represented a significant C loss that increased with fertilization in both edge and interior marsh. Sediment C input was a significant C source in the interior, nearly doubling with fertilization, but represented a small source on the edge. When extrapolating C exchanges to the entire marsh, including edge which comprised 17% of the marsh area, the marsh displayed net loss of C despite a net C gain in the interior. Fertilization increased net C loss fivefold. Extrapolation of NECB to whole marshes requires inclusion of C fluxes for both edge and interior marsh.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh ecosystems rely on carbon accumulation to increase elevation and survive sea level rise. The amount of carbon accumulated in a marsh is the net result of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, fixation of carbon by photosynthesis, export of dissolved carbon to the creek, and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments deposited on the surface. Because each component varies between edge and interior marsh, it is challenging to estimate carbon accumulation for a whole marsh system. It is not currently known how increasing nitrogen pollution impacts carbon accumulation for a whole marsh. To find out, we compared measurements of carbon accumulation in fertilized and unfertilized plots in the edge and interior of a salt marsh at Freeman Creek, North Carolina, USA. Overall, the marsh gained carbon in the interior but lost carbon on the edge, leading to a loss of about 50,000 kg C year(-1) across the 0.5 km(2) marsh area. However, under fertilized conditions, Freeman Creek marsh carbon loss increased nearly fivefold overall as a result of the large increase in carbon loss from the edge marsh. This study shows that increasing nitrogen pollution in coastal waters will cause increasing net carbon loss in marshes.

TI  - Reproductive biology of Neohelice granulata (Decapoda: Varunidae) in two salt marshes of the estuarine region of the Lagoa dos Patos Lagoon, southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Neohelice granulata is a crab found in salt marshes and mangroves of the south and south-eastern Atlantic coast of South America. Reproductive biology was studied by taking samples for two years at two salt marshes-'Prainha' and 'Ilha'-in the estuarine region of Patos Lagoon (southern Brazil). Ovigerous females were found most of the year in both salt marshes with average CW ranging from 18.5 (Prainha) to 22.8 mm (Ilha). A significant linear relationship was found between log(CW) and log(number of eggs). Average size at the onset Of maturation was 14.9 and 14 mm at Prainha, for males and females, respectively, while at Ilha it was 18.2 and 16.8 mm, for males and females, respectively. Results provided evidence of significant differences in reproductive traits between populations of the two salt marshes. Differences are likely related to the higher organic matter content found in the sediment from Ilha.

TI  - Marsh edge erosion and associated carbon dynamics in coastal Louisiana: A proxy for future wetland-dominated coastlines world-wide
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland loss through marsh edge erosion is a serious problem in Louisiana. The majority of studies on coastal land loss use aerial and satellite photographic analysis while field and site-specific measurements are limited. The aim of this study was to spatially and temporally measure coastal marsh edge erosion and investigate factors responsible for differences in erosion including shoreline orientation, soil physio-chemical properties, and wind speed and duration. A total of 33 transects across six island sites in northern Barataria Basin, Louisiana were established. Transects on shorelines facing different compass directions were measured for erosion for up to 2 years. Soils were analyzed for physiochemical properties including bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Bathymetric surveys were conducted to determine the extent of the erosive bay bottom profile. In addition, C-14 dating of the basal organic matter (1.5-1.6 m) was conducted. Erosion rates ranged from 49.27 to 324.85 cm y(-1) with a mean value of 141.69 +/- 22.45 cm y(-1). As expected, erosion rates were significantly different (p < 0.001) between protected and unprotected sites. The erosion rate was not correlated with wind speed (r = -0.07), weakly correlated with compass direction of shoreline (r = 0.25) and water level (r = 0.25) but strongly correlated with duration of wind (r = 0.60). Erosion rate was negatively correlated (r = -0.45) with bulk density and positively correlated with organic matter content (r = 0.42) of the top 40 cm of the soil. Over time, the marsh is eroded down to a depth of 1.5 m, which correlates to annual loss of 1.82 +/- 0.29 m(3) volume of marsh per meter shoreline length including a loss of organic matter (141.5 +/- 22.55 kg m(-1)) and carbon (63.32 +/- 10.09 kg m(-1)) previously preserved for up to 850 years. As a consequence, annual CO2 emissions for Barataria Basin were estimated to be 1.56 +/- 0.26 million tCO(2)e y(-1). Results can inform coastal managers as to the most vulnerable marshes to target restoration efforts. Due to high relative sea level rise in coastal Louisiana, these results can also be used to inform the world's stable coastlines on the relative vulnerability of their coastal marshes in the near future, due to projected eustatic sea level. Consequently, the eroding coastlines across the globe may be a significant source of CO2 emissions in near future, as millennial age stored soil carbon is released in a relatively short time, potentially overwhelming human efforts to slow rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

TI  - INFAUNAL COMMUNITY-DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIALLY ESTABLISHED SALT MARSHES IN NORTH-CAROLINA
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, artificial establishment of Spartina alterniflora marshes has become a common method for mitigating impacts to salt marsh systems. The vegetative component of artificially established salt marshes has been examined in several studies, but relatively little is known about the other aspects of these systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the infaunal community of artificially established salt marshes. Infauna were sampled from pairs of artificially established (AE) salt marshes and nearby natural marshes at six sites along the North Carolina coast. The AE marshes ranged in age from 1 yr to 17 yr. Total infaunal density, density of dominant taxa, and community trophic structure (proportions of subsurface-deposit feeders, surface-deposit and suspension feeders, and carnivores) were compared between the two types of marsh to assess infaunal community development in AE marshes. Overall, the two marsh types had similar component organisms and proportions of trophic groups, but total density and densities within trophic groupings were lower in the AE marshes. Soil organic matter content of the natural marshes was nearly twice that of the AE marshes, and is a possible cause for the higher infaunal densities observed in the natural marshes. Using the same three criteria, comparisons of the natural and AE marshes at each of the six locations revealed varying degrees of similarity. Similarity of each AE marsh to its natural marsh control appeared to be influenced by differences in environmental factors between locations more than by AE marsh age. Functional infaunal habitat convergence of an AE marsh with a natural marsh somewhere within its biogeographical region is probable, but success in duplicating the infaunal community of a particular natural marsh is contingent upon the developmental age of the natural marsh and the presence and interaction of site-specific factors.

TI  - Floodplain Wetland Channel Planform, Cross-Sectional Morphology, and Sediment Characteristics Along an Estuarine to Tidal River Gradient
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of wetland channel networks on coastal river floodplains is affected by spatial transitions in tidal-fluvial processes. This study evaluated sedimentation patterns in tidal marshes on the 147-km tidal Columbia River and its 87-km estuary and characterized the cross-sectional geometry and planform morphometry of tidal wetlands along the estuarine to riverine gradient. Tidal marshes were predominantly depositional (median 0.7 cm yr(-1), primarily silt), consistent with late-Holocene rates. Marsh sediment accretion rate increased with annual maximum 7-day average daily maximum water depth. Elevation was negatively correlated with accretion rate in the tidal river and positively correlated with total organic carbon (TOC%) in the tidal river and estuary. TOC% was greater in the estuary and, like percent fines, greater farther from the main-channel Columbia River. For four single-channel and six channel-network planforms of tidal marsh, shrub-dominated, and forested wetlands: (1) Spatial patterns of cross-sectional morphology conformed to typical coastal wetland morphology in estuarine reaches up to the tidal river. (2) Reach-based and common slope linear models for channel perimeter on wetland area were predictive in the estuary (R-2 > 0.81) and differed between island (n = 144) and mainland (n = 164) wetlands. No planform linear models were predictive for the entire study area or the tidal river. No models for channel outlets were acceptable. (3) Channel perimeter, surface area, and outlets were all highly variable within and among estuarine-riverine reaches. Analyses of sediment, cross-section, and planform support the use of a "natural network paradigm" for wetland-restoration design on tidal river floodplains.

TI  - Zonation of the staphylinid fauna in a salt marsh of the North Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany).
T2  - Faunistisch-Oekologische Mitteilungen
M3  - Article
AB  - The zonation of the rove beetle fauna (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) was studied in a salt marsh of the Wadden Sea near Friedrichskoog, Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany), by means of pitfall traps in the years 1997 and 1998. Pit fall traps were installed with 5 replicates in an elevational gradient at 20 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm, and 130 cm above MHT (mean high tide: 157 cm + NN, NN: 500 cm above 0 at Amsterdam gauge). The rove beetle fauna exhibits two assemblages, which exactly correspond with the vegetational communities. The elevation above MHT was the major environmental parameter, which highly correlated with the flood frequency. The other environmental parameters, e.g.. electric conductivity, sand content, content of organic matter, mean yearly water content, and pH of soil, had no significant influence on the occurrence of species. The lower salt marsh (Puccinellietum) is significantly preferred by only four species, while in the upper salt marsh (Juncetum gerardii) 17 species occurred with significant higher abundance. The mean occurrence referring elevation and flood frequency was calculated for 34 species. Even the species preferring the lower salt marsh seem to have their highest abundance not at the lowest level at 20 cm above MHT, but at 40 cm or 60 cm above MHT. Brundinia marina, the most common species in the lower salt marsh, shows a shifting abundance within the elevational gradient, while Bledius tricornis constantly occurs at the preferred elevation of 60 cm above MHT.

T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Holocene sea-level curve is constructed from the facies distribution and radiocarbon ages of sediment recovered from the distal, southern salt marsh of Langebaan Lagoon, on the southwest coast of South Africa. Calibrated radiocarbon analyses of an oyster-rich bioclastic gravel indicate that the Flandrian Transgression flooded the lagoon to 0-3 m above present-day levels by 6750 years ago (6.8 ka). Organic matter and shell material dated in distal lagoonal sediments indicate that sea level returned to present-day levels by 4.9 ka and have since remained within +/-1 m of present-day levels. Bleached shell and a hiatus in sedimentation suggest an approximate 1 m sea-level lowstand between 2.5 and 1.8 ka Changes in the macrobenthos assemblage since 1.5 ka that include the loss of the oyster Ostrea atherstonei, razor clam Solen capensis, brown mussel Arcuatula capensis and periwinkle Oxystele variegata reflect loss of hard substrate, decreased tidal-flow velocities as reworked sands prograded into the southern lagoon and possibly cooler sea-surface temperatures. Calibrated radiocarbon ages of bulk organic matter from diatom-rich, Zostera muddy quartzose sands indicate a 0.5 m sea-level highstand at 1.3 ka followed by a 0.5 m lowstand at 0.7 ka. Dating of fining-upward, organic-rich (2 wt % TOC) noncalcareous muds indicates that the present-day salt marsh has grown by aggradation (similar to1 mm y(-1)) and progradation since 0.7 ka.

TI  - The Influence of Salt Marsh Fucoid Algae (Ecads) on Sediment Dynamics of Northwest Atlantic Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Resilience is currently a key theme within salt marsh ecological studies. Understanding the factors that affect salt marsh accretion and elevation gains is of paramount importance if management of these ecosystems is to be successful under increasing synergistic stresses of storm surge, inundation period, and eutrophication. We present the results of salt marsh fucoid algae (ecads) removal experiments on Spartina alterniflora abundance, production and decomposition, and the sedimentary dynamics of two marshes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The presence of the thick layer of marsh fucoids had a significant and positive influence on sediment deposition, accretion, and concentration of water column particulates, while it inhibited water flow. Decomposition rates of S. alterniflora in the field were significantly higher under the fucoid macroalgae layer, and, in lab experiments, S. alterniflora seedlings added more leaves when the marsh fucoids were present. In contrast, fucoids caused a significant decrease in S. alterniflora seedlings' survival in the field. We found that marsh fucoids are stable despite not being attached to any substrate, and field surveys revealed a relatively widespread, but not ubiquitous, distribution along outer Cape Cod. Salt marsh fucoid algae directly and substantially contribute to salt marsh sediment elevation gain, yet their potential inhibitory effects on colonizing S. alterniflora may counteract some of their overall contributions to salt marsh persistence and resilience.

TI  - The Difference of Litter Decay, Litter- and Sediment-Associated Hydrolytic Enzymes between Brackish and Freshwater Tidal Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While an increase in saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater environments will undoubtedly affect ecosystem functioning, the resultant impacts on litter decay and hydrolytic enzyme activities remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the decay of shichito matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of litter decomposition, but could change the dominant pathway.

TI  - EFFECTS OF NITROGEN ADDITION, TEMPERATURE AND PHYSICAL PROTECTION ON FIRST-PHASE DECOMPOSITION OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN MARSHLAND
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined effect of nitrogen (N) addition, temperature change and crushing on the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is still poorly understood. A short-term incubation experiment was conducted to investigate this problem using soils from a freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Our results showed that increase in temperature promoted SOC decomposition, whereas nitrogen addition inhibited SOC decomposition. Crushing produced varied effect on SOC decomposition: changing from positive to neutral as temperature increasing. The suppressing effects from N addition was weaker than stimulating effect from a 10 degrees C increase in temperature on SOC decomposition, leading to a positive effect on SOC decomposition from N addition and temperature change. Combined effect of N addition and crushing on SOC decomposition varied from promotion to inhibition following increase in temperature. The combined effects of nitrogen addition and temperature, crushing and temperature, and the combined effect of these three factors on SOC decomposition were antagonistic, whereas the combined effect of N addition and crushing on SOC decomposition was additive. Both N addition and crushing decreased the temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition.

AB  - We assessed the utility of delta C-13 and bulk geochemistry (total organic content and C:N) to reconstruct relative sea-level changes on the Cascadia subduction zone through comparison with an established sea-level indicator (benthic foraminifera). Four modern transects collected from three tidal environments at Siletz Bay, Oregon, USA, produced three elevation-dependent groups in both the foraminiferal and delta C-13/bulk geochemistry datasets. Foraminiferal samples from the tidal flat and low marsh are identified by Miliammina fusca abundances of >45%, middle and high marsh by M. fusca abundances of <45% and the highest marsh by Trochamminita irregularis abundances >25%. The delta C-13 values from the groups defined with delta C-13/bulk geochemistry analyses decrease with an increasing elevation; -24.1 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand in the tidal flat and low marsh; -27.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand in the middle and high marsh; and -29.6 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand in the highest marsh samples. We applied the modern foraminiferal and delta C-13 distributions to a core that contained a stratigraphic contact marking the great Cascadia earthquake of AD 1700. Both techniques gave similar values for coseismic subsidence across the contact (0.88 +/- 0.39 m and 0.71 +/- 0.56 m) suggesting that delta C-13 has potential for identifying amounts of relative sea-level change due to tectonics.

TI  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora in controlled cultivation: Environmental implications of converging future technologies
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical's secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas.

TI  - Seasonal variations of nitrous oxide fluxes and soil denitrification rates in subtropical freshwater and brackish tidal marshes of the Min River estuary
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes provide favorable conditions for nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Saltwater intrusion caused by sea-level rise would exert complex effects on the production and emission of N2O in estuarine tidal marshes; however, few studies have been conducted on its effects on N2O emissions. Salinity gradients are a common occurrence in estuarine tidal marshes. Studies on production and emission of N2O in tidal marshes with different salinities may elucidate the impact of saltwater intrusion on the emission of greenhouse gases. This study explores the seasonal variations of N2O fluxes and soil denitrification rates in freshwater (Daoqingzhou wetland) and brackish (Shanyutan wetland) tidal marshes dominated by Cyperus malaccensis var. brevifolius (shichito matgrass) in the Min River estuary, southeastern China. N2O fluxes in both marshes showed strong temporal variability. The highest N2O fluxes were observed in the hot and wet summer months, whereas the lowest fluxes were observed in the cold winter and autumn months. N2O fluxes from the freshwater marsh (48.81 +/- 9.01 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those from the brackish-water marsh (27.69 +/- 4.01 mu g m(-2) h(-1)). Soil denitrification rates showed a similar temporal pattern, with the highest rates observed in summer and the lowest in winter. Similarly, soil denitrification rates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the freshwater marsh (32.72 +/- 19.15 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) than in the brackish-water marsh (4.97 +/- 2.64 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). Temperature and the salinity, sulfate (SO42-), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations of the overlying water were key factors affecting soil denitrification rates. N2O fluxes and soil denitrification rates demonstrated negative correlations with salinity and SO42- concentrations in both marshes. The results indicate that increased seawater intrusion would reduce N2O emissions from estuarine tidal wetlands and exert a negative feedback on the climate system. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Refining Estimates of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Salt Marsh "Blue Carbon" Erosion and Decomposition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This "blue carbon" in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) for 161 days. Q(10) of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.2 +/- 0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ . mol(-1) and 58.8 kJ . mol(-1) for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90 +/- 2.81 Gg C . yr(-1) is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS.

TI  - Greenhouse gas response and Spartina alterniflora resilience to macroalgal exposure
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can alter salt marsh plant communities and their associated carbon flux dynamics via several mechanisms. Due to warming waters and sea level rise, macroalgal wrack accumulation rates in salt marshes are expected to increase. The smothering and shading effects of macroalgal wrack can have adverse effects on salt marsh vegetation. Most studies have focused on the impacts of high-density accumulation or future accumulation projections, but the impacts of current accumulations of macroalgae on Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) are unclear. We investigated how current, relatively low-density ephemeral (Ulva spp.) and perennial (Fucus spp.) algal wrack coverage impacts S. alterniflora survival and associated greenhouse gas fluxes. We created mesocosms with S. akentiflora-vegetated soil cores using a 2 x 2 factorial design with Fucus and Ulva present or absent. After one month, S. alterniflora cores with Ulva (but no Fucus) had a significantly lower stem density, but they later recovered, attesting to S. alterniflora's resilience to low-density macroalgal coverage. Our results also suggest that Fucus can alter the interaction between Ulva and S. alterniflora by potentially mitigating Ulva's impacts. Macroalgal presence did not significantly influence greenhouse gas fluxes, which suggests the low-density exposure is not altering the salt marsh carbon flux dynamics.

TI  - Proximate Composition, Bioactive Compounds, and Antioxidant Potential of Wild Halophytes Grown in Coastal Salt Marsh Habitats.
T2  - Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Halophytes have been characterized as a potential resource for fiber, food, fodder, and bioactive compounds. Proximate composition, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of five wild dominant halophytes (Arthrocnemummacrostachyum, Halocnemumstrobilaceum, Limoniastrummonopetalum, Limoniastrumpruinosum, and Tamarix nilotica) naturally growing along the Nile Delta coast were assessed. The soil supporting these halophytes was sandy to sand-silty, alkaline, with low organic carbon, and relatively high CaCO3. H. strobilaceum attained the highest moisture content, ash, crude fiber, lipids, and total soluble sugars. L. monopetalum showed the highest content of crude protein (18.00%), while T. nilotica had the highest content of total carbohydrates. The studied halophytes can be ranked according to their nutritive value as follows: H.strobilaceum > L.monopetalum > A.macrostachyum > L.pruinosum > T. nilotica. A. macrostachyum attained the highest amount of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. A. macrostachyum showed a high content of phenolic compounds, while H.strobilaceum was rich in tannins and saponin contents. The MeOH extract of A. macrostachyum and H. strobilaceum exhibited substantial antioxidant activity. The present results showed that the studied halophytes could be considered as candidates for forage production or used as green eco-friendly natural resources for bioactive compounds.

TI  - Use of natural and created Spartina alterniflora salt marshes by fishery species and other aquatic fauna in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared densities of nekton and infauna among 5 natural and 10 created (3 to 15 yr in age) salt marshes in the Galveston Bay system of Texas to test whether these marshes were functionally equivalent. Decapod crustaceans dominated the nekton on the marsh surface during both the spring and the fall. Densities of daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, the most abundant decapod, were not significantly different among marshes, but the size of these shrimp in created marshes was significantly smaller than in natural marshes. Densities of the marsh grass shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris and of 3 commercially-important crustaceans (white shrimp Penaeus setiferus, brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus, and blue crab Callinectes sapidus) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus were the most abundant fish collected, mainly on nonvegetated bottom adjacent to marsh habitats. Fish densities within vegetation (predominantly gobies and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Natural and created marshes, however, did not differ in species richness of nekton. Sediment macro-organic matter and density and species richness of macroinfauna (mainly polychaete worms) were all significantly lower in created marshes than natural marshes. There was a positive relationship in created marshes between marsh age and sediment macro-organic matter, but marsh age was not related to nekton densities. Natural marshes were similar in having low elevations and flooding durations between 74 and 80% of the year; while created marshes were flooded from 43 to 91% of the time. In contrast to marsh age, tidal flooding was often related to nekton densities in marsh habitats. We conclude that marsh elevation and tidal flooding are key characteristics affecting use by nekton and should be considered in marsh construction projects.

AB  - Sediment cores were collected from three sites within the Plum Island Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research (PIE-LTER) domain in Massachusetts to obtain estimates of long-term marsh decomposition and evaluate shifts in the composition and reactivity of sediment organic carbon in disturbed marsh environments. Paired sediment cores were collected from three sites on the marsh platform and from three ponds; these cores were about 100 and 50 centimeters in length, respectively. The marsh sites had similar elevations, at about 1.41 to 1.51 meters relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and similar salt marsh grass communities, dominated by Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, and Distichlis spicata. Permanently inundated ponds within each site had comparable depths (0.24?0.30 meters) but varied in size (between 643 and 7,149 square meters; Spivak et al., 2017, 2018). The U.S. Geological Survey analyzed radioisotope concentrations for lead-210, radium-226, cesium-127, and beryllium-7 from six marsh cores and three pond cores to develop an age model for each core. This data release includes calculated percent dry bulk density and raw radioisotope data for these cores.

TI  - Salt marsh sediment bacteria: their distribution and response to external nutrient inputs
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary focus among microbial ecologists in recent years has been to understand controls on the distribution of microorganisms in various habitats. Much less attention has been paid to the way that environmental disturbance interacts with processes that regulate bacterial community composition. We determined how human disturbance affected the distribution and community structure of salt marsh sediment bacteria by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA in five different habitats in each of four salt marshes located in northeastern Massachusetts, USA. Two of the four marsh creeks were experimentally enriched 15 x above background by the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers for two or more growing seasons. Our results indicate that extrinsic factors acting at broad scales do not influence the distribution of salt marsh sediment bacteria. Intrinsic factors, controlled by local-scale environmental heterogeneity, do play a role in structuring these sediment microbial communities, although nutrient enrichment did not have a consequential effect on the microbial community in most marsh habitats. Only in one habitat, a region of the marsh creek wall that is heavily colonized by filamentous algae, did we see any effect of fertilization on the microbial community structure. When similar habitats were compared among marshes, there was considerable convergence in the microbial community composition during the growing season. Environmental factors that correlated best with microbial community composition varied with habitat, suggesting that habitat-specific intrinsic forces are primarily responsible for maintaining microbial diversity in salt marsh sediments.

M3  - Article
AB  - Lignin-derived phenols, C/N ratios and ratios of refractory to total organic matter were used to study the sources, distribution, and diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter along estuary, river bank, and salt marsh systems. The Changjiang Estuary showed a higher signal of terrestrial organic matter at the river mouth which decreased farther offshore. The locations along the Qiantang River were affected by their adjacent surroundings, and the Andong salt marsh showed higher terrestrial organic matter signal at the upper marsh compared to the lower marsh. All studied areas showed slight increases in organic matter decomposition farther downstream and towards the sea. Study of these three different systems will improve our understanding on their ecotoxicological impact. The Changjiang Estuary had higher pollutant levels near the river mouth, which decreased farther offshore due to dilution. The midstream Qiantang River was most likely affected by pollution from their adjacent surroundings. Pollutants were likely to be accumulated in the Andong salt marsh due to the presence of marsh plants and small-sized particles. Organic pollutants were likely to be decomposed during transport along the systems. The ability of the sediments to release inorganic pollutants was determined by whether these systems were oxic or anoxic.

TI  - Oceanographic and human impacts on the compositions of sedimentary organic matter along the southern coast of Zhoushan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three sediment cores were collected from the southern coastal area of Zhoushan Island, and their lignin-derived phenol, bulk elemental composition, stable carbon isotope, particle size and 210Pb activities were determined. The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size. Thus, local input and increased phytoplankton production will play a more important role in the carbon dynamics in this coastal area in the future. (245 words).

TI  - Changes in soil carbon sequestration and soil respiration following afforestation on paddy fields in north subtropical China
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsAlthough many studies have reported net gains of soil organic carbon (SOC) after afforestation on croplands, this is uncertain for Chinese paddy rice croplands. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of afforestation of paddy rice croplands on SOC sequestration and soil respiration (R-s). Such knowledge would improve our understanding of the effectiveness of various land use options on greenhouse gas mitigation in China.MethodsThe investigation was conducted on the Chongming Island, north subtropical China. Field sites were reclaimed from coastal salt marshes in the 1960s, and soils were homogeneous with simple land use histories. SOC stocks and R-s levels were monitored over one year in a paddy rice cropland, an evergreen and a deciduous broad-leaved plantation established on previous paddy fields and a reference fallow land site never cultivated. Laboratory incubation of soil under fast-changing temperatures was used to compare the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC decomposition across land uses.Important FindingsAfter 15-20 years of afforestation on paddy fields, SOC concentration only slightly increased at the depth of 0-5 cm but decreased in deeper layers, which resulted in a net loss of SOC stock in the top 40 cm. Seasonal increase of SOC was observed during the rice-growing period in croplands but not in afforested soils, suggesting a stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping. However, SOC sequestered under cropping was more labile, as indicated by its higher contents of dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass. Also, paddy soils had higher annual R-s than afforested soils; R-s abruptly increased after paddy fields were drained and plowed and remained distinctively high throughout the dry farming period. Laboratory incubation revealed that paddy soils had a much higher Q(10) of SOC decomposition than afforested soils.. Given that temperature was the primary controller of R-s in this region, it was concluded that despite the stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping, its SOC was less stable than in afforested systems and might be more easily released into the atmosphere under global warming.

T2  - Hydrobiological Bulletin
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt marshes along the Westerschelde estuary have been influenced by various human activities of which reclamation, has been a major cause for the lost of salt marsh area. The salinity gradient in the aquatic system is also mirrored in the vegetation of the salt marshes. The role of the salt marshes for the estuary as a whole is manifold but a major importance is their function as a sink for anthropogenic substances. The possible role as a carbon and mineral source for the estuary is discussed in this paper. It is estimated that the total area of salt marsh adds about 8% to the organic matter input in the estuary while the nutrient input may be as high as 25%.

TI  - Importance of allochthonous material in benthic macrofaunal community functioning in estuarine salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Allochthonous input provides important food and spatial resources for estuarine benthic fauna. While it is known that autochthonous materials are important for fauna occupying small marshes, here, we present the significance of allochthonous materials for benthic fauna inhabiting a large salt marsh. To assess the effects of allochthonous input on benthic macrofaunal communities in estuarine salt marshes, we determined the source of substrate sediments and food resource utilisation patterns of benthic invertebrates in 2 temperate estuaries (the Tama River and the Obitsu River estuarine outlets into Tokyo Bay) by using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. In the Tama River estuary, which has small patches of marsh vegetation upstream of the river mouth, there was an input of sedimentary organic matter from autochthonous sources (i.e. common reed and microphytobenthos). In the Obitsu River estuary salt marsh, which is situated immediately upstream of the river mouth and is well connected to the sea, sediment consists of allochthonous sources (i.e. imported phytoplankton), along with microphytobenthos. Isotope analysis indicated that most benthic invertebrates in the Tama River estuary depend on benthic microalgae (autochthonous) as a food resource, whereas the macrofauna in the Obitsu River estuary are supported by drift macroalgae (allochthonous), in addition to microphytobenthos or phytoplankton. Our results indicated that allochthonous material provides a food resource and potential habitat for benthic macrofauna in extensive salt marshes that have a strong connection to the sea but is not substantial in smaller marshes with limited connectivity to coastal water.

TI  - Ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa population response to living shoreline design and ecosystem development
T2  - Open Science Framework
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal communities increasingly invest in natural and nature-based features (e.g., living shorelines) as a strategy to protect shorelines and enhance coastal resilience. Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the East Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2 to 16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: 1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, 2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and 3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

TI  - Effects of flooding and warming on soil organic matter mineralization in Avicennia germinans mangrove forests and Juncus roemerianus salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Under a changing climate, coastal wetlands experience sea level rise, warming, and vegetation change, all of which may influence organic matter mineralization. In coastal wetlands of subtropical west-central Florida (USA), we investigated how soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization respond to soil water, temperature, and ecosystem type (Avicennia germinans mangrove forest vs. Juncus roemerianus salt marsh). We evaluated how soil respiration and mineral N concentration varied along a soil moisture gradient, and whether these relationships differed between ecosystem types. Then, we manipulated soils in a 28-d laboratory incubation to evaluate how potentially mineralizable C and N respond to temperature (23 vs. 27 degrees C), soil hydroperiod (inundated 4 vs. 20 h/d), and soil source. Soil saturation and inundation suppressed short-term (minutes to weeks) C mineralization from near-surface soils. Soil CO2 efflux declined by 65% as soil moisture increased from 75% to 85%, and potentially mineralizable C was 18% lower with a 20-h hydroperiod than with a 4-h hydroperiod. Organic C quality appears to be greater in A. germinans than in J. roemerianus soils, as A. germinans soils had higher field CO2 efflux rates and greater mineralizable C:N (despite lower total C:N). Increasing incubation temperature from 23 to 27 degrees C elevated potentially mineralizable C by 40%, indicating that two symptoms of climate change (increased inundation from sea level rise, and warming) may have opposing effects on soil C mineralization. Temperature sensitivity of C mineralization was high for long-hydroperiod soils, however, suggesting that protection of soil organic matter (SUM) due to prolonged inundation will be undermined by warming. Potentially mineralizable N was greater in J. roemerianus soils, although in situ mineral N was not different between ecosystems, instead correlating positively with SOM. These results indicate that models forecasting soil elevation responses to climate change might include inundation effects on mineralization rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - A six-step sequential extraction technique was used to determine the chemical association of heavy metals (Ph, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Ni) with major sedimentary phases (exchangeable ions, carbonates, manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulfides and organic metals and residual minerals) in samples from salt marshes on the southern Atlantic coast of Spain (Odiel and Bay of Cadiz Salt Marshes). The total metal content was determined as well. In the Bay of Cadiz Salt Marsh sediments, all the metals, except Mn and Pb, were extracted from the residual fraction at a percentage greater than 50%. In the Odiel Salt Marsh, however, only Cr surpasses 50%. The metals that are most easily extractable in the samples analysed were Mn, Zn, Ph and Cd. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - For the time period 1974-1993, fluxes were estimated of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) brought to the salt marshes of Georgia and South Carolina by eight rivers, which drain approximately 75% of the upland watersheds of these estuaries. During this period, concentrations of DOC and DON averaged 5-28 mg C l(-1) and 0.35-0.75 mg N l(-1), respectively. The DON represented 40-90% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in the rivers during that period. River inputs to the marsh estuaries averaged 32.4 +/- 8.8 thousand tonne yr(-1) for DOC and 27.8 +/- 10.0 hundred tonne yr(-1) for DON. These inputs represent approximately 0.6 and 0.15%, respectively, of the DOC and DON estimated to be produced in situ in the salt marshes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term succession of benthic infauna communities on constructed Spartina alterniflora marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic infauna communities were characterized along a chronosequence (1 to 28 yr old) of 7 constructed Spartina alterniflora Loisel marshes and 7 natural (reference) marshes to identify patterns of succession following salt marsh creation. Infauna density and species richness (per 7.07 cm(2) core) achieved equivalence to comparable reference marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Taxa with dispersing larval stages (e.g. Streblospio benedicti, Capitella sp.) achieved equivalence within 3 yr following marsh creation. Taxa that lack a planktonic dispersal stage, such as tubificid oligochaetes and Manayunkia aesturina, were slower to develop. Densities of Manayunkia did not achieve equivalence to natural marshes until 8 yr after marsh creation. Twenty-five yr elapsed before oligochaete densities of constructed marshes were similar to natural marshes. In constructed marshes, densities of surface-deposit feeders, dominated by Streblospio and Manayunkia, achieved equivalence to natural marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Subsurface-deposit feeders, consisting mostly of oligochaetes, did not become equivalent to natural marshes for 25 yr. Predictable trajectories, described by an asymptotic increase over time, existed for total species, species richness, and surface- and subsurface-deposit feeders. Oligochaetes and Manayunkia, which produce non-dispersing larvae, exhibited linear trajectories over time. In constructed marshes, total density and density of dominant taxa and trophic groups were strongly correlated with soil characteristics, especially organic C, N, bulk density and macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat). Non-linear regressions using soil organic C and MOM explained 38 to 40% of the variation in constructed marsh infauna density. The regressions suggest that a threshold of 0.5% soil organic C (500 g m(-2), 0 to 10 cm) and 500 g MOM m(-2) (0 to 10 cm) is needed to support infauna densities comparable to densities found in natural marshes. Taxon richness of constructed marshes was more strongly related to vegetation characteristics, especially macro-organic matter quality (e.g. lignin) than soil characteristics. Development of benthic infauna communities following marsh construction requires longer than the 5 yr monitoring period required by many wetland mitigation plans, and as much as 25 yr are needed for some attributes (e.g. oligochaetes) to achieve equivalence.

T2  - LTER Network Information System Repository
M3  - Data set
AB  - Oysters are ecosystem engineers in marine ecosystems, but the functions of oyster shell deposits in intertidal salt marshes are not well understood. The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.

TI  - Analysis of forty years long changes in coastal land use and land cover of the Yellow Sea: The gains or losses in ecosystem services
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from similar to 10,500 km(2) (1980s) to similar to 6700 km(2) (2010s), say similar to 1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached similar to 9700 km(2), including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (similar to 99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (similar to 31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as similar to 8 billion USD yr(-1) with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION OF MODERN SALT-MARSH FORAMINIFERA FROM THE EASTERN MISSISSIPPI SOUND, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study documented surface distributions of live and dead foraminiferal assemblages in the low-gradient tidal marshes of the barrier island and estuarine complex of the eastern Mississippi Sound (Grand Bay, Pascagoula River, Fowl River, Dauphin Island). A total of 71,833 specimens representing 38 species were identified from a gradient of different elevation zones across the study area. We identified five live assemblages and nine biofacies for the dead assemblages from estuarine, low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, and upland transition environments. Although dissolution of calcareous tests was observed in the dead assemblages, characteristic species and abundance patterns dependent on elevation in the intertidal zone were similar between living assemblages and dead biofacies. The assemblages from the eastern Mississippi Sound estuaries were dominated by Ammonia tepida, Cribroelphidium poeyanum, C. excavatum, and Paratrochammina simplissima. The low marshes were dominated by Ammotium salsum, Ammobaculites exiguus, and Miliammina fusca. The dominant species in the middle marshes was Arenoparrella mexicana. The most abundant species in the high marshes was Entzia macrescens. The upland-marsh transition zones were dominated by Trochamminita irregularis and Pseudothurammina limnetis. Canonical correspondence analysis was applied to assess the relationship between a priori defined biofacies and measured environmental data (elevation, grain size, organic matter, and salinity) to test the hypothesis that distribution of foraminiferal assemblages is driven by elevation and hence flooding frequency. Salinity was the second most important explanatory variable of dead assemblages. Riverine freshwater from the Pascagoula River markedly influenced the live and dead assemblages in the Pascagoula River marsh, which was represented by low diversity and densities and dominance by Ammoastuta inepta. The relationship between the measured environmental variables and assemblage distributions can be used in future Mississippi Sound paleo-environmental studies.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora on heavy metals pollution of intertidal sediments, sediment cores of a S. alterniflora salt marsh and a mudflat in Bohai Bay, China were analyzed. The results showed that S. alterniflora caused higher total C and P, but lower bulk density and electrical conductivity. The levels of Cd, Cu and Pb were higher in S. alterniflora sediment. Both Cd and Zn were higher than the probable effect level at both sites, indicating their toxicological importance. The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk indexes revealed higher metal contamination in S. alterniflora sediment. Multivariate analysis implied that anthropogenic activities altered mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals. The percentage of mobile heavy metals was higher in S. alterniflora sediment, indicating improvement of conversion from the immobilized fraction to the mobilized fraction. These findings indicate that S. alterniflora may facilitate accumulation of heavy metals and increase their bioavailability and mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion alters ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and N2O and carbon sequestration in a coastal salt marsh in China
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in mitigating global warming. To evaluate the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on global warming potential (GWP) in Chinese coastal areas, we measured CH4 and N2O fluxes and soil organic carbon sequestration rates along a transect of coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province, China, including open water; bare tidal flat; and invasive S. alterniflora, native Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis marshes. Annual CH4 emissions were estimated as 2.81, 4.16, 4.88, 10.79, and 16.98kg CH(4)ha(-1) for open water, bare tidal flat, and P. australis, S. salsa, and S. alterniflora marshes, respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasion increased CH4 emissions by 57-505%. In contrast, negative N2O fluxes were found to be significantly and negatively correlated (P<0.001) with net ecosystem CO2 exchange during the growing season in S. alterniflora and P. australis marshes. Annual N2O emissions were 0.24, 0.38, and 0.56kg N(2)Oha(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat and S. salsa marsh, respectively, compared with -0.51kg N(2)Oha(-1) for S. alterniflora marsh and -0.25kg N(2)Oha(-1) for P. australis marsh. The carbon sequestration rate of S. alterniflora marsh amounted to 3.16 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1) in the top 100cm soil profile, a value that was 2.63- to 8.78-fold higher than in native plant marshes. The estimated GWP was 1.78, -0.60, -4.09, and -1.14Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1)yr(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat, P. australis marsh and S. salsa marsh, respectively, but dropped to -11.30Mg CO(2)eqha(-1)yr(-1) in S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicate that although S. alterniflora invasion stimulates CH4 emissions, it can efficiently mitigate increases in atmospheric CO2 and N2O along the coast of China.

TI  - Can a Single Species Challenge Paradigms of Salt Marsh Functioning?
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the history of ecology, well-established generalizations were refined or even changed after the appearance or consideration of new evidence. Here, we review results obtained in Southwestern Atlantic salt marshes (between southern Brazil -32A degrees 1' S- and the Argentinean Patagonia -53A degrees 48' S-). Most of these salt marshes are inhabited by the intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice granulata, a species that influences many ecological processes through bioturbation and herbivory. The experimental evaluation of these processes shows that in some cases, the results were not consistent with generalizations and models of salt marsh ecological functioning. However, this does not imply that the generalizations grounded mainly on the results from North American sites are not valid. In turn, we suggest that these apparently conflicting results emerged because two major processes, herbivory and bioturbation, have been overlooked until recently. Thus, their relative contribution has not been included in the models of salt marsh functioning. In conclusion, we believe that there is a need for performing parallel and simultaneous experiments comparing distant sites with varying environmental (i.e., abiotic and biotic) conditions to be able to uncover common processes and causes of contingencies. Particularly, Southwestern Atlantic salt marshes could lead the way in providing information to better incorporate herbivory and bioturbation into current models or paradigms about how salt marshes work.

T2  - WETLANDS AND REMEDIATION II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Wetlands and Remediation
CL  - BURLINGTON, VT
AB  - Sorption/desorption studies were conducted to determine desorption-resistance of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in recently deposited wetland peat soils. Sorption/desorption characteristics of chlorobenzene and phenanthrene were investigated for highly organic surface (top 0-2 cm) and deeper fresh marsh soil (below 10-cm) and low organic Petro Processors, Inc. Superfund site Devil's Swamp wetland soil (PPI soil) and Bayou Manchac soil (BM soil). A biphasic desorption model was used to fit the sorption/desorption data to explain the desorption-resistance in wetland soils. The results of biphasic desorption model indicated the presence of appreciable desorption-resistant phase in wetland soils. A finite maximum capacity of desorption-resistant fraction (q(max)(irr)) was observed after several desorption steps. When organic carbon normalized, q(max,oc)(irr) of the wetland soils was smaller than those of PPI and BM soils. The apparent organic carbon based partition coefficient (K-oc(irr)) for the desorption-resistant compartment was increasing in order of surface (10(4.32 +/-10.39)) < deeper (10(4.75+/-0.13)) <Ppi (10(5.39+/-0.09)) < BM (10(5.49+/-0.04)) soil. The results suggest that the effect of desorption-resistance on the bioavailability of sorbed HOCs should be considered in remediation and risk assessments in wetlands.

TI  - Impact of the invasive native species Elymus athericus on carbon pools in a salt marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of the invasive native clonal grass Elymus athericus is one of the most significant changes that have affected the plant communities of European salt marshes in the last decade. The goal of this study was to investigate the rate of this invasion and its impact on C cycling in a non-grazed salt marsh of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France). Aboveground net primary production (ANPP), litter quantity and quality, and decomposition rates were quantified in Elymus athericus and in the original plant communities ("control"). Since 1991, Elymus athericus has been replacing the characteristic plant communities at a rate of 4 ha yr(-1). ANPP was significantly higher in Elymus athericus (3011 +/- 347 gDW m(-2) yr(-1) and 1181 +/- 1123 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) than in the control (2028 +/- 239 gDW m(-2) yr(-1) and 771 +/- 76 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) stands. Lignin content of Elymus athericus' litter was 3.5 times greater than in the litter of the control communities, explaining its accumulation under the vegetation (i.e., litter quantity was from 2 to 10 times greater under Elymus athericus than under the control vegetation). C mineralization in the sediment (expressed as rate of CO2 per mass of sediment) was significantly lower under Elymus athericus than under the control vegetation. Our results suggest that Elymus athericus increased C trapping within the salt marsh and thus limits the potential for C exportation toward coastal waters.

TI  - Vegetation loss alters soil nitrogen dynamics in an Arctic salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 Plant and microbial nitrogen (N) dynamics were examined in soils of an Arctic salt marsh beneath goose-grazed swards and in degraded soils. The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth.2 In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of (NH4Cl)-N-15 into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial N-15 excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of N-15. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated N-15 such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils.3 The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer.4 Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of N-15 in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion.5 Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen loading on emission of carbon gases from estuarine tidal marshes with varying salinity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes sequester significant quantities of carbon and arc suffering from anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enhancement. However, the effects of this N loading on carbon gas emissions from freshwater-oligohaline tidal marshes are unknown. In this paper, we report on our evaluation of the effects of a N gradient (0, 24, 48 and 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2) y(-1)) on the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. On an annual scale, the oligohaline marsh has significantly higher CO2 emissions, while it has slightly lower CH4 emissions relative to freshwater marsh. The addition of N increased CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh and decreased CH4 emission from the oligohaline marsh, although there was no statistically significant difference in CH4 emission between either of the two marshes and the control. The addition of 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2 )y(-1) significantly increased CO2 emission from the freshwater marsh, while it did not significantly influence CO2 emission from the oligohaline marsh. CH4 and CO2 emission levels were positively correlated with soil temperature under all conditions. The CH4 flux resulting from both the control and the addition of N was negatively correlated with porewater SO42- and Cl- concentrations and soil EC in the oligohaline marsh. Overall, N addition significantly increased carbon gas emissions under freshwater conditions while slightly inhibiting carbon gas emissions from the oligohaline marsh. Our findings suggested that even under low salinity conditions, the effects of N loading on CH4 and CO2 emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes can vary. We propose that the addition of N to estuarine tidal marshes has a significant effect on the carbon cycle and promotes soil carbon loss, phenomena which may be influenced by salinity.

TI  - Primary production and macro-detritus dynamics in a European salt marsh: carbon and nitrogen budgets
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary production and the detritus pathway (i.e., detritus production, litter fall, export to coastal waters, and decomposition) were studied over a I-year period in three salt marsh levels (low, middle and high marshes). Carbon and nitrogen content in biomass and macro-detritus were estimated at each step of the detrital pathway. Several lines of evidence suggested that low, middle and high marshes had different properties which affected their interaction with adjoining waters. More than species diversity, the salt marsh zonation across a 1.8 km transect resulted in a spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of organic matter and nutrients within the salt marsh. The low marsh was the less productive level (1080 g dry weight m-(2) per year) and was a source of organic matter for the two other marsh levels. Almost 89% of the organic matter produced in the low marsh was flushed away by the tide and redistributed inside the marsh, whereas the remainder decomposed quickly (0.023 per day) at the production site. The export of macro-detritus to coastal waters was probably insignificant to the carbon and nitrogen balance of the salt marsh. In the middle and high marshes, most of the production fell as litter directly at the production site. In the high marsh, vegetation stands were very productive (1990 g dry weight m(-2) per year) and litter decomposed slowly (0.0047 per day), The middle marsh was as productive as the high marsh (1910 g dry weight m(-2) per day), but the decay rate (0.028 per day) was similar to that estimated for the low marsh. This study demonstrates that the mineralization of halophyte-derived organic matter takes place almost completely within the marsh itself. Data on carbon and nitrogen decay indicated that only a small part of the high marsh production was rapidly available to fuel food webs of the ecosystem or to be exported to coastal waters. In contrast, the high amount of biomass produced in the middle marsh was rapidly available for food webs, Export of organic matter may be controlled by macro-detritus production (amount and timing), intensity and time distribution of tide events, and, mostly, decay rates. Because for most of the year the marsh is exposed to the atmosphere, we suggest that exchanges of gaseous carbon and nitrogen with the atmosphere should be investigated.

TI  - On autochthonous organic production and its implication for the consolidation of temperate salt marshes
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The organic production related to minerogene salt marsh deposits represents a challenge to all attempts to model the development of these areas, and evaluate their chances of survival under different sea level scenarios. Salt marsh deposits on a typical temperate backbarrier saltmarsh area at the Skallingen barrierspit (Denmark) were investigated for autochthonous or below ground organic production, which was found to have a mean value of 0.14 kg m(-2) y(-1) or about 0.1 mm y(-1). This production is concentrated in the upper approximately 5 cm of the salt marsh. Below this level the organic material decomposes with a decreasing organic content until about 15 cm below the surface. Hereunder the decomposition of organic material seems to stabilize at a very low level. The constant rate of the below ground organic production results in a larger concentration of this type of organic matter in the slowest accreting salt marsh deposits. The root activity is the primary reason for differences in the bulk dry density of salt marsh surface layers, therefore the surface layers of slowly accreting salt marshes have the lowest bulk dry density. During autocompaction, the bulk dry density increases down core. This process is only to a small degree (<10%) directly affected by the space loss due to decomposition of organic matter. The decay of organic matter, however, is most likely indirectly part of the autocompaction process by weakening the internal strength of the root fabric and thus the capability of resistance against compaction from the overburden of depositing sediments.

TI  - Influence of agricultural system transition on trace element contamination in salt marsh and seagrass sediments from a coastal Ramsar site
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems have an important role as contaminant filters. Temporal variations in concentrations, enrichment factors (EF), and fluxes of trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) were evaluated in 210Pb-dated sediment cores from salt marsh and seagrass ecosystems at San Quint?n Bay (Mexican northern Pacific). Trace element contamination was negligible in seagrass sediments, but minor to severe, depending on the element, in salt marsh cores, owing to higher organic carbon and fine sediment contents. EF temporal variation in salt marsh cores was attributed to agriculture technology changes (e.g. installation of greenhouses, and improved irrigation and fertilization systems). Trace element flux ratios increased during the past 100 years, likely caused by steadily increasing sediment accumulation rates promoted by land-use changes in the catchment. The conservation of salt marsh areas is important to preserve their function as contaminants biofilters and the health of adjacent ecosystems.

TI  - Natural and manipulated sources of heterogeneity controlling early faunal development of a salt marsh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem recovery following wetland restoration offers exceptional opportunities to study system structure, function, and successional processes in salt marshes. This study used observations of natural variation and large-scale manipulative experiments to test the influence of vascular vegetation and soil organic matter on the rate and trajectory of macrofaunal recovery in a southern California created salt marsh, the Crown Point Mitigation Site. During the first three years following marsh establishment, macrofaunal density and species richness recovered rapidly within the Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) zone; densities in the created marsh were 50% of those in the natural marsh after 16 mo and 97% after 28 mo. However, the early successional assemblage had a lower proportion of tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes, and a higher proportion of chironomids and other insect larvae than did the mature natural marsh. Most of the colonizers arrived by rafting on sea grass and algae rather than by larval dispersal. Initial planting of S. foliosa had no influence on macrofaunal recovery, perhaps because of variable transplant survival. However, subsequently, both positive and negative correlations were observed between densities of some macrofaunal taxa and shoot densities of S. foliosa or Salicornia spp. (pickleweed). Salinity and measures of soil organics (belowground biomass, combustible organic matter, and chlorophyll a) also were correlated with macrofaunal densities and taxon richness. Of foul added soil amendments (kelp, alfalfa, peat, and Milorganite), Milorganite (a sewage product) and kelp both promoted macrofaunal colonization during year 1, but effects were short lived. The most significant sources of heterogeneity in the recovering marsh were associated with site history and climate variation. Faunal recovery was most rapid in highly localized, organic-rich marsh sediments that were remnants of the historical wetland. Elevated sea level during the 1998 El Nino corresponded with similarity of macrofaunal communities in the created and natural marshes. The large spatial scale and multi-year duration of this study revealed that natural sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may exert stronger influence on faunal succession in California wetlands than manipulation of vegetation or soil properties.

T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Joint Conference on Limnology and Oceanography : Oceans, Rivers and Lakes - Energy and Substance Transfers at Interfaces
CL  - NANTES, FRANCE
AB  - Among the 90 fishspecies censused in the Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France), 23 colonise and forage in the salt marshes during flood. Therefore, this environment may play an important trophic and nursery role for these species. This community is largely dominated by mullets (81% of the biomass), Liza ramada and secondarily L. aurata. But gobies (mainly Pomatoschistus minutus and P. lozanoi) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) are also present; they represent respectively 11% and 4% of the biomass. During the tide cycles, mullets export from salt marshes about 7% of their body weight (FW) containing a mixture of sediment (43%), organic matter (24%) and water (33%). Gobies and sea bass mainly feed on dwelling macro-invertebrates, and they export respectively 4.5% and 10% of their body weight during a tide cycle. Thus, we estimated that 50 tonnes year(-1) of particulate organic matter (dry weight POM) are exported from the 4000 ha of salt marshes to the marine coastal waters. These fish communities appear to be POM transporters and could play a significant role in the global energy budgets of coastal environments such as Mont Saint-Michel Bay. According to the seasons and the years, the energy exported by fish communities is assumed to range between 0 and 10% of the total POM output.

TI  - Barnacle colonization on Spartina alterniflora in Georgia salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of barnacles within a habitat is influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic factors that impact barnacle recruitment and/or settlement. In Georgia salt marshes, barnacles (specifically Chthamalus fragilis) have been observed colonizing leaves and stems of S. alterniflora, which is the dominant plant species in marshes along the Gulf and East Coast. The aims of this study were to: 1) identify spatial and short-term monthly patterns of barnacle colonization within individual S. alterniflora as well as across sites of varying marine influence during peak barnacle recruitment and plant growth and 2) determine the effect of barnacle settlement on S. alterniflora growth and productivity. Patterns of barnacle settlement and measurements of plant growth and productivity were assessed through a field survey and field experiment in three salt marshes of varying proximity to oceanic inputs. Two marsh sites were dominated by tall-form S. alterniflora and one was composed of short-form plants. Results suggested spatial and short-term monthly patterns in barnacle settlement both across sites and within individual plants. Specifically, there was significantly greater barnacle density on stems and leaves of plants in salt marshes with greater marine influence. Furthermore, there was a decrease in barnacle settlement on S. alterniflora leaves and increase in settlement on stems from June to August, suggesting short-term monthly patterns in the portion of the plant colonized. Within individual plants, there was a significantly greater density of large barnacles on the middle segments of the stem and greater barnacle colonization in the non-axils of the stems compared to leaf axils. A potential negative impact of barnacle settlement on S. alterniflora was observed at the site with the greatest barnacle density and marine influence, which was also the site dominated by short-form S. alterniflora. These plants showed significantly lower photosynthetic efficiency in August, but it is unclear whether this was related to barnacle settlement, edaphic conditions, or both. Information on the patterns of barnacle settlement and its impact on S. alterniflora will be vital to coastal managers in salt marsh conservation strategies.

TI  - Clay mineralogy, grain size distribution and their correlations with trace metals in the salt marsh sediments of the Skallingen barrier spit, Danish Wadden Sea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the behavior of trace metals in the salt marsh at Skallingen, Danish Wadden Sea, we investigated a profile from surface to 25 cm depth of the salt marsh sediment, focusing primarily on clay mineralogy and grain size distribution of the sediments and their relationship with trace metals. The clay assembly of the sediment consists of illite, kaolinite and much less chlorite and smectite. The major clay minerals of illite, kaolinite as well as chlorite correlate very poorly with all the trace metals investigated, due probably to the weak competing strength of these clays compared with the other adsorbents and to low availability of the mobile trace metals in the system. Correlation between trace metals and clay minerals may therefore be used as an indicator in environmental assessment. Fine grain fractions of the sediment increased markedly after salt marsh invasion in about 1931 but decreased after 1964. This increase was contributed mainly by the grains finer than 20 mu m while the fraction of 40-63 mu m actually decreased soon after the invasion. The relation between most of the trace metals and grain size distributions is close in general but far from linear. The drastic turning point is observed at about 30 mu m, around where the correlation coefficient r drops from 0.8 to 0.1. Adsorption is the controlling mechanism for the behavior of trace metals in the salt marsh. Fe/Mn (hydr)oxides and organic matter play the key role.

TI  - Shifts in Microbial Biomass C/N/P Stoichiometry and Bacterial Community Composition in Subtropical Estuarine Tidal Marshes Along a Gradient of Freshwater-Oligohaline Water
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltwater intrusion results in increased estuarine salinity, affecting both ecosystem nutrient dynamics and bacterial community composition in estuarine tidal marshes. However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity. Also, rhizospheres exerted a major control on increasing MBC and MBP but rarely affected bacterial community composition or diversity.

TI  - Comparative ecophysiology of four wetland plant species along a continuum of invasiveness
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the ecophysiological performance of four dominant, perennial plant species of tidal marshes of northeastern North America (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Spartina alterniflora, and Leersia oryzoides), asking whether species that fall along a continuum of invasiveness vary consistently in terms of primary productivity, growth, biomass allocation, phenology, maximal photosynthetic rate, leaf turnover, tissue nutrient and chlorophyll content, and water use. During 1999, we examined plants growing at two brackish marshes and two freshwater tidal marshes in southern Connecticut, USA. Phragmites and Typha consistently exceeded the other two species in both marsh types in terms of ramet biomass, standing crop, length of the growing season, standing leaf area, leaf longevity, and total chlorophyll. Typha, Phragmites, and Spartina showed similar maximal photosynthetic rates across marsh types, significantly greater than the P-max observed in Leersia. Foliar nitrogen was significantly greater in Phragmites than in all other species, suggesting that this species accrues nutrients more efficiently. Phragmites and Typha populations did not differ in a number of characters between freshwater and brackish marshes, indicating low sensitivity to exposure to moderate salinity levels. A principle components analysis placed Phragmites and Typha close to each other and more distant from Spartina and Leersia along axes describing components of competitive ability and photosynthetic performance. Thus, moderately and highly invasive species are distinct from less invasive species in terms of ecophysiology in both wetland types. As Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia displace other plant species in marshes, they will likely influence the carbon- and nitrogen-cycling functions of wetlands, subject to the species' varying tolerances for salinity.

TI  - In situ soil net nitrogen mineralization in coastal salt marshes (Suaeda salsa) with different flooding periods in a Chinese estuary
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding periods can be one of the most important factors influencing nitrogen (N) biogeochemical processes in wetlands ecosystem. We conducted a field study using in situ incubation method to investigate the seasonal dynamics of soil net N mineralization in three coastal salt marshes (Suaeda salsa) with different flooding periods (i.e., short-term (STF), seasonal (SF), and tidal (TF) flooding wetland) in the Yellow River Delta. Selected soil inorganic N pools (ammonium, nitrate and inorganic N) and N transformation (mineralization, nitrification and ammonification) rates in the top 0-10 cm soils were repeatedly quantified from April to October. Clear seasonal patterns in inorganic N pools and transformation rates were observed in accord with the seasonal variations of temperature and moisture. Generally, higher levels of soil inorganic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) occurred in the early-growing season (April), and NH4+-N contents got a small accumulative peak in midsummer (September). The lower rates (negative) of net mineralization (R-min), nitrification (R-nit) and ammonification (R-amm) were observed in the early-growing season (April-June) and fall (September-October), whereas higher values (positive) in midsummer (August-September). Flooding had a significant influence on inorganic N pools (except for NH4+-N) and transformation rates (p < 0.05). R-min values in SF wetland were significantly higher in the August-September period than those in other incubation periods R-nit values in TF wetland exhibited a small variation and the highest value occured in the June-August period. The results of principal component analysis showed that soil samples were clearly divided into two groups before and after flow-sediment regulation. After flooding events, the R-mm and R-amm values generally increased in the three wetlands, whereas a significant decrease in R-nit values was observed in SF wetland (p < 0.05), thus the differences in NO3--N among these wetlands were eliminated. These results suggested that seasonal variations in temperature and moisture are important factors influencing inorganic N pools and transformation rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Projected Impact of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill on US Gulf Coast Wetlands
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon spill oiled coastal wetland ecosystems along the northern Gulf of Mexico. We present data on probable impacts and recovery of these impacted wetlands. Based on numerous greenhouse and field studies conducted primarily in coastal Louisiana, we suggest that marsh vegetation will recover naturally without need for intensive remediation. Oiled marshes may reduce the availability of habitat for mobile fish species, resulting in their translocation to unimpacted areas. Impacts on benthic organisms may result in shift sin microbial community structure, but they will probably recover in lightly oil-impacted areas. The degradation rate or length of time oil remains in impacted wetlands depends on environmental conditions. Oil-impacted soils already contain adequate indigenous microorganisms capable of degradation under suitable environmental conditions. Nutrient addition, especially N, may increase the rate of oil biodegradation when sediment nutrient levels are low, but O-2 availability appears to be the most important variable controlling oil degradation in marsh soils. Oil impacts on sediment O-2 demand and restriction in O-2 exchange at the sediment-water interface can alter biogeochemical processes and gaseous exchange (CO2 and CH4) with the atmosphere. Even though there were harmful impacts resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, prior research has demonstrated that Gulf Coast marshes are resilient and can recover. This view is supported by field observations of new shoots appearing in heavily oiled marshes 1 yr following the spill. Even though this review shows that Gulf Coast marshes have a high natural recovery potential, many ecological processes have not been adequately quantified or identified.

TI  - Site Characteristics More Than Vegetation Type Influence Food Web Structure of Intertidal Salt Marshes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are under increasing anthropogenic pressures that have been reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis, which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the summer of 2010 in four creeks from two sites from Western France (the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay and the Seine Estuary). Analysis was undertaken using C and N stable-isotope compositions. Tested response variables (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase in the Mont-Saint Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays, with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea bass and the thinlip mullet was unchanged by local salt marsh vegetation, and considered consistent with their diet. This study highlights the relevance of stable-isotopes analyses for assessing long-term and integrative effects of changes in vegetation resulting from human disturbances in salt marshes.

T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS

CP  - 10th Iberian Seminar on Marine Chemistry
CL  - UNIV CADIZ, CADIZ, SPAIN
AB  - The Bay of Cadiz is surrounded by a broad zone of salt marshes that exchange water through a seawater channel 18 km in length (the Sancti Petri Channel). These littoral zones are characterized by their extreme shallowness (with a mean depth of less than 1 m) and their high content of organic matter, which in relative terms is highest in the surface sediments (between 1.2% and 2.6% organic carbon). Under these conditions, an intensive benthic regeneration of nutrients takes place, with mean fluxes in the zone of 83.2 +/- 36.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of inorganic carbon, 6.36 +/- 4.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of NH4+, 1.14 +/- 0.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of HPO42- and 4.54 +/- 2.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of SiO2. A proportion of these nutrients and inorganic carbon produced make their way through secondary channels to the Sancti Petri Channel, and the material is later transported by the tides to the Bay of Cadiz and other bordering littoral zones. In this work, the concentrations of inorganic carbon and nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, HPO42- and SiO2) have been determined at three different depths, every hour, during complete tidal cycles. Simultaneously, the current velocities at different depths have been measured continuously. From this set of experimental data, calculations have been made of the evolution of the instantaneous velocities of these substances at each end of the channel, and by integration, the net balance for the complete tidal cycle. In general terms, there is an export of inorganic carbon and nutrients with the tides, although the net transports are very variable and depend to a large extent on the hydrodynamics of the zone. The results obtained correlate with balances previously made in the Bay of Cadiz.

TI  - Ecosystem engineers drive creek formation in salt marshes
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem engineers affect different organisms and processes in multiple ways at different spatial scales. Moreover, similar species may differ in their engineering effects for reasons that are not always clear. We examined the role of four species of burrowing crabs (Sesarma reticulatum, Eurytium limosum, Panopeus herbstii, Uca pugnax) in engineering tidal creek networks in salt marshes experiencing sea level rise. In the field, crab burrows were associated with heads of eroding creeks and the loss of plant (Spartina alterniflora) stems. S. reticulatum was closely associated with creek heads, but densities of the other crab species did not vary across marsh zones. In mesocosm experiments, S. reticulatum excavated the most soil and strongly reduced S. alterniflora biomass. The other three species excavated less and did not affect S. alterniflora. Creek heads with vegetation removed to simulate crab herbivory grew significantly faster than controls. Percolation rates of water into marsh sediments were 10 times faster at creek heads than on the marsh platform. Biomass decomposed two times faster at creek heads than on the marsh platform. Our results indicate that S. reticulatum increases creek growth by excavating sediments and by consuming plants, thereby increasing water flow and erosion at creek heads. Moreover, it is possible that S. reticulatum burrows also increase creek growth by increasing surface and subsurface erosion, and by increasing decomposition of organic matter at creek heads. Our results show that the interaction between crab and plant ecosystem engineers can have both positive and negative effects. At a small scale, in contrast to other marsh crabs, S. reticulatum harms rather than benefits plants, and increases erosion rather than marsh growth. At a large scale, however, S. reticulatum facilitates the drainage efficiency of the marsh through the expansion of tidal creek networks, and promotes marsh health.

TI  - Trophic shift in young-of-the-year Mugilidae during salt-marsh colonization
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the trophic shift of young-of-the-year (YOY) thinlip grey mullet Liza ramada and golden grey mullet Liza aurata during their recruitment in a salt marsh located on the European Atlantic Ocean coast. Stable-isotope signatures (13C and 15N) of the fishes followed a pattern, having enrichments in 13C and 15N with increasing fork length (LF): 13C in fishes<30mm ranged from 19.5 to 15.0 parts per thousand, whereas in fishes>30mm 13C ranged from 15.8 to 12.7 parts per thousand, closer to the level in salt-marsh food resources. Large differences between the 15N values of mugilids and those of food sources (6 center dot 0 parts per thousand on average) showed that YOY are secondary consumers, similar to older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YOY mugilids shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30mm LF. The results highlight the role of European salt marshes as nurseries for juvenile mugilids. (C) 2013 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology (C) 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

TI  - Short-Term Effects of Thin-Layer Sand Placement on Salt Marsh Grasses: A Marsh Organ Field Experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes can build in elevation with sea-level rise through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter, but marshes worldwide are under threat of drowning due to rapid rates of sea-level rise that outpace natural marsh building rates. The application of a thin layer of sediment to the marsh surface (thin-layer placement ETLII) is a tool to build elevation and decrease flooding stress, but its effects on marsh plants are understudied, especially in New England. In a novel application of a marsh organ experiment (i.e. rows of pots at different elevations), the addition of 10 cm of sand to pots planted with Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens resulted in fewer stems than controls for S. patens but not S. alterniflora after 2 months. However, total biomass and root mass were not significantly impacted for either species, suggesting plants will fully recover from TLP over longer timescales. Effects of TLP on biomass and stem density did not vary significantly by elevation. Although long-term research is still needed, short-term equivalency in biomass between TLP treatments and controls suggests TLP of 10 cm is a promising strategy to enhance the ability of marshes to build vertically as sea level rises in New England.

CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - The impact of marsh carbon export (outwelling) on estuarine metabolism has been debated for the last three decades. Much of this controversy stems from interpretations of stable isotope data. Although the outwelling of marsh carbon to the estuaries can be substantial, the stable isotope signal (delta C-13) Of marsh material is generally not detected except in sediments and infauna at marsh fringes. However, most of these studies focus on the delta C-13 Of either particulate organic carbon (POC) or the delta C-13 Of estuarine organisms that depend on POC, even though this carbon pool may be the least likely to provide a marsh signal. A series of simple models are developed to show how marsh outwelling affects the delta C-13 of POC and the other major estuarine carbon pools, i.e., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The models show that a marsh delta C-13 Signal will only be detected in estuarine POC or DIC when the marsh area is substantially larger than the estuary. However, because estuarine in-situ DOC production is only a fraction of POC production, our mixing models suggest that a marsh signal should be found in estuarine DOG, even when the marsh areas is smaller that the estuarine area. Finally, a transport model, incorporating a simplified bathymetry and hydrology for the Parker River, MA, is used to back calculate marsh outwelling from the estuarine delta C-13-DOC. The model estimate of marsh DOC outwelling is consistent with other estimates, and suggests that our parameterization of estuarine transport and degradation processes that regulate DOC isotope ratios is probably also correct.

TI  - The role of landscape composition and disturbance type in mediating salt marsh resilience to feral hog invasion
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat patch composition and configuration mediate the fitness and distribution of many species. However, we know little about how this landscape complementation may influence the distribution of an invasive species' ecological impacts and, in turn, how this affects ecosystem resilience to disturbance. We surveyed > 820 km of coastline to evaluate how landscape complementation mediates patterns in invasive feral hog (Sus scrofa) rooting, trampling and wallowing disturbances in southeastern US salt marshes and assessed marsh resilience to these behaviors in an 8-site survey and 13-month field experiment. We discovered that hog rooting and trampling most often occur where hardwood forest comprises > 30% and salt marsh < 22% of habitat surrounding each surveyed site, respectively, while wallowing correlated most strongly with salt marsh invertebrate densities. At the 8 survey sites, vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, and surface elevation were consistently lower, and soil anoxia and porewater ammonium-nitrogen higher, in hog-disturbed relative to undisturbed areas. The experiment revealed that vegetation can recover when rooted or trampled, but remains depressed when wallowed or repeatedly disturbed. Together, these findings provide novel evidence that habitat patch composition at landscape scales can act together with local habitat attributes to dictate invasive species' disturbance patterns and highlight areas most vulnerable to invaders. In salt marshes, insights gleaned from such consideration of landscape complementation can inform conservation and management strategies for curbing the impact of this prolific, global invader.

TI  - Rapid peat development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests: ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems. Despite growing understanding of factors controlling mangrove forest soil carbon stocks, there is a need to advance understanding of the speed of peat development beneath maturing mangrove forests, especially in created and restored mangrove forests that are intended to compensate for ecosystem functions lost during mangrove forest conversion to other land uses. To better quantify the rate of soil organic matter development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests, we measured ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence. We compared ecosystem properties in created, maturing mangrove forests to adjacent natural mangrove forests. We also quantified site-specific changes that occurred between 2010 and 2016. Soil organic matter accumulated rapidly beneath maturing mangrove forests as sandy soils transitioned to organic-rich soils (peat). Within 25 yr, a 20-cm deep peat layer developed. The time required for created mangrove forests to reach equivalency with natural mangrove forests was estimated as (1) <15 yr for herbaceous and juvenile vegetation, (2) ~55 yr for adult trees, (3) ~25 yr for the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), and (4) ~45-80 yr for the lower soil layer (10-30 cm). For soil elevation change, the created mangrove forests were equivalent to or surpassed natural mangrove forests within the first 5 yr. A comparison to chronosequence studies from other ecosystems indicates that the rate of soil organic matter accumulation beneath maturing mangrove forests may be among the fastest globally. In most peatland ecosystems, soil organic matter formation occurs slowly (over centuries, millennia); however, these results show that mangrove peat formation can occur within decades. Peat development, primarily due to subsurface root accumulation, enables mangrove forests to sequester carbon, adjust their elevation relative to sea level, and adapt to changing conditions at the dynamic land-ocean interface. In the face of climate change and rising sea levels, coastal managers are increasingly concerned with the longevity and functionality of coastal restoration efforts. Our results advance understanding of the pace of ecosystem development in created, maturing mangrove forests, which can improve predictions of mangrove forest responses to global change and ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Speciation of heavy metals in recent sediments of three coastal ecosystems in the Gulf of Cadiz, southwest Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A five-step sequential extraction technique was used to determine the partitioning of Cr, Mn, Fe, CLI, Zn, Cd. and Pb among the operative sedimentary phases (exchangeable ions, carbonates, manganese and iron oxides, sulfides and organic matter, and residual minerals) in coastal sediment from three locations in the southwest Iberian Peninsula. Two sites are located close to industrial areas. the salt marshes of the Odiel River and Bay of Cadiz, and one in a nonindustrial area, the Barbate River salt marshes. The Odiel River salt marshes also receive the drainage from mining activities in the Huelva region. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn were extracted from the residual fraction at percentages higher than 60%. In the sediments from the Odiel River salt marshes, concentrations of all the metals, except Cu, Zn, and Cd, exceeded 60% in the residual fraction as well. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Mn and Cd: in those from the Odiel River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Zn and Cd, respectively. The environmental risk was determined by employing the environmental risk factor (ERF), defined as ERF = (CSQV - Ci/CSQV), where Ci is the heavy metal concentration in the first four fractions and CSQV is concentration sediment quality value (the highest concentration with no associated biological effect). Our results showed that the sediments from the Cadiz Bay and Barbate River salt marshes do not constitute any environmental risk under the Current natural conditions. In contrast, in the Odiel River salt marshes. Cu. Zn. and Pb yielded ERFs of less than zero at several sampling stations and, consequently, pose a potential threat for the organisms in the area. This is a consequence of the high levels of metals in the area derived from the mining activity (pyrite) and industrial activities and the association of these heavy metals with more labile fractions of the sediments.

TI  - Environmental controls on the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera from the southern coastline of South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Salt-marsh foraminifera are widely used as robust sea-level indicators. High-resolution Holocene sea-level reconstructions depend on the accurate characterization of modern foraminifera-environment relationships representative of a study site. We investigate the relationship between modern foraminiferal assemblage distribution and key environmental variables, viz. elevation above land levelling datum (LLD), sediment grain size, organic content, pH and salinity. We hypothesize that the distribution of modern salt-marsh foraminifera is primarily controlled by elevation above LLD.Location Knysna and Keiskamma estuaries along the southern coastline of South Africa.Methods Salt-marsh surface sediment samples (n = 97) were collected along eight intertidal transects with corresponding environmental data (pH, salinity, organic content, sand, silt, clay and elevation). Multivariate ordination analysis (partial redundancy analysis; pRDA) was used to investigate the relationship between living foraminiferal assemblages and environmental controls, after accounting for spatial variability in community composition.Results The pRDA suggests that species composition varied spatially within estuaries, but was strongly influenced by elevation at Keiskamma (r = 0.63) and Knysna (r = -0.75). At Keiskamma, the main gradient in composition was also influenced by salinity (r = -0.63), in an equal and opposite manner to elevation. Composition at Keiskamma was influenced to a much lesser extent by sediment organic content (r = 0.20) and the clay fraction (r = -0.13). At Knysna, pH (r = 0.455) was a secondary determinant of composition, and sediment characteristics covaried with elevation.Main conclusion Elevation was found to be a key environmental variable controlling the distribution of salt-marsh foraminifera at both estuaries, thereby validating the use of foraminifera as sea-level indicators. Certain species were particularly sensitive to elevation changes and could thus serve as useful indicators of past sea-level change. This is an important first step towards the development of high-resolution sea-level reconstructions for the South African coastline.

TI  - Microspatial ecotone dynamics at a shifting range limit: plant-soil variation across salt marsh-mangrove interfaces
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecotone dynamics and shifting range limits can be used to advance our understanding of the ecological implications of future range expansions in response to climate change. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone is an area where range limits and ecotone dynamics can be studied in tandem as recent decreases in winter temperature extremes have allowed for mangrove expansion at the expense of salt marsh. In this study, we assessed aboveground and belowground plant-soil dynamics across the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone quantifying micro-spatial patterns in horizontal extent. Specifically, we studied vegetation and rooting dynamics of large and small trees, the impact of salt marshes (e.g. species and structure) on mangroves, and the influence of vegetation on soil properties along transects from underneath the mangrove canopy into the surrounding salt marsh. Vegetation and rooting dynamics differed in horizontal reach, and there was a positive relationship between mangrove tree height and rooting extent. We found that the horizontal expansion of mangrove roots into salt marsh extended up to eight meters beyond the aboveground boundary. Variation in vegetation structure and local hydrology appear to control mangrove seedling dynamics. Finally, soil carbon density and organic matter did not differ within locations across the salt marsh-mangrove interface. By studying aboveground and belowground variation across the ecotone, we can better predict the ecological effects of continued range expansion in response to climate change.

TI  - Characterization of dissolved organic matter in submarine groundwater from a salt marsh in Chongming Island, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Salt marshes are research hotspots of the carbon cycle in coastal zones because large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide is fixed by salt marshes vegetation and stored in its biomass and soil. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in submarine groundwater (well water and pore water) in salt marshes plays an important role in advective exchange between the salt marshes and coastal waters. However, the molecular characteristics of DOC in salt marsh groundwater are poorly understood because of the complex DOC structures and hydrodynamic process. In this study, fluorescent components and refractory DOC (RDOC) in submarine groundwater from a salt marsh (Chongming Island, China) and adjacent coastal water were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fluorescent components identified by parallel factor analysis indicated that humic-like substances dominated the chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater had non-conservative behaviors because of additions from terrestrial humic substances. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated that bioactive substances (carbohydrates) contributed only 13.2%-14.8% of the dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater but carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAMs), the main components of RDOC, contributed 64.5% of the dissolved organic matter. Carbohydrates and CRAMs contributed 16.4% and 61.7% of the dissolved organic matter in the coastal water, similar to the contributions for submarine groundwater. The DOC concentration in submarine groundwater was 386 +/- 294 mu mol/L, which was significantly higher than that in coastal water (91 +/- 19 mu mol/L). The high DOC concentrations and >60% relative RDOC content suggested that submarine groundwater may be an important source of RDOC to coastal seawater. This information will be helpful for estimating the climate effects of salt marsh blue carbon.

TI  - Effect of salinity-altering pulsing events on soil organic carbon loss along an intertidal wetland gradient: a laboratory experiment
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity changes resulting from storm surge, tides, precipitation, and stormwater run-off are common in coastal wetlands. Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.

TI  - Decadal shifts in a salt marsh macroinfaunal community in response to sustained long-term experimental nutrient enrichment
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of nutrient enrichment on benthic macroinfauna was examined in a long-term experiment that increased food supply in a macroinfaunal community inhabiting salt marsh muddy tidal creeks in Great Sippewissett Marsh (MA, USA). After 15 years of nutrient addition, macrofaunal density and production were higher in fertilized compared to control creeks, primarily because of the response of oligochaete species. Although mean annual total secondary production was higher in fertilized creeks (9.4 g dry weight . m(-2). y(-1)) than in control creeks (6 g dry weight . m(-2). y(-1)), P:B ratios for the key species were similar in both creeks, ranging between 2 and 3. Sustained enrichment shifted species dominance in fertilized creeks. Two oligochaete species, the naidid Paranais litoralis (Muller, 1784), and the tubificid Monopylephorus evertus Baker and Brinkhurst, 1981, became the dominant species responding to the sustained enhancement of food resources by the fertilizer addition. In non-fertilized creeks, the polychaete Streblospio benedicti Webster, 1879, remained the dominant species throughout the 15 year duration of the experiment. The fertilizer has stimulated growth of different oligochaete populations that are able to exploit different resources through the year (bottom-up regulation). During summer, the bottom-up effect of fertilization disappears, and predation controls invertebrate abundance (top-down regulation).

TI  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Enhances CO2 Exchange Rates in Freshwater Marsh Ecosystems in the Florida Everglades
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - This research examines the relationships between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), water level, precipitation patterns and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange rates in the freshwater wetland ecosystems of the Florida Everglades. Data was obtained over a 5-year study period (2009&#8211;2013) from two freshwater marsh sites located in Everglades National Park that differ in hydrology. At the short-hydroperiod site (Taylor Slough; TS) and the long-hydroperiod site (Shark River Slough; SRS) fluctuations in precipitation patterns occurred with changes in ENSO phase, suggesting that extreme ENSO phases alter Everglades hydrology which is known to have a substantial influence on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Variations in both ENSO phase and annual net CO2 exchange rates co-occurred with changes in wet and dry season length and intensity. Combined with site-specific seasonality in CO2 exchanges rates, El Ni&#241;o and La Ni&#241;a phases magnified season intensity and CO2 exchange rates at both sites. At TS, net CO2 uptake rates were higher in the dry season, whereas SRS had greater rates of carbon sequestration during the wet season. As La Ni&#241;a phases were concurrent with drought years and extended dry seasons, TS became a greater sink for CO2 on an annual basis (&#8722;11 to &#8722;110 g CO2 m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1) compared to El Ni&#241;o and neutral years (&#8722;5 to &#8722;43.5 g CO2 m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1). SRS was a small source for CO2 annually (1.81 to 80 g CO2 m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1) except in one exceptionally wet year that was associated with an El Ni&#241;o phase (&#8722;16 g CO2 m&#8722;2 yr&#8722;1). Considering that future climate predictions suggest a higher frequency and intensity in El Ni&#241;o and La Ni&#241;a phases, these results indicate that changes in extreme ENSO phases will significantly alter CO2 dynamics in the Florida Everglades.

TI  - Effects of waterlogging and salinity increase on CO2 efflux in soil from coastal marshes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.

TI  - Shallow ponds are heterogeneous habitats within a temperate salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating spatial heterogeneity into assessments of salt marsh biogeochemistry is becoming increasingly important because disturbances that reduce plant productivity and soil drainage may contribute to an expansion of shallow ponds. These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd Seminar of the EU-Concerted-Action-Group on Halophyte Uses in Different Climates
CL  - FLORENCE, ITALY
AB  - Sediments have been sampled in seven Tagus estuary salt marshes at three depths: 0-5 cm, 15-25 cm (zone of higher root density), and 45-55 cm (below the roots). Collection was done in areas colonised by Spartina maritima, Halimione portulacoides and Arthrocnenum fruticosum. Concentrations of zinc, lead, copper, cadmium and loss on ignition were determined, as well as the fraction of metals extracted by DTPA. Metal concentrations were not correlated to LOI, and enrichment factors (defined as the ratio of metal concentration in the 0-5 cm and 45-55 cm layers) were higher in salt marshes closer to the anthropogenic sources. However, the fraction of metals extracted by DTPA in sediment between roots was inversely correlated to LOI. This suggests that metals are more easily uptaken by the plants as organic matter in the sediments degrades.

TI  - Restricting Prey Dispersal Can Overestimate the Importance of Predation in Trophic Cascades
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Predators can affect prey populations and, via trophic cascades, predators can indirectly impact resource populations (2 trophic levels below the predator) through consumption of prey (density-mediated indirect effects; DMIEs) and by inducing predator-avoidance behavior in prey (trait-mediated indirect effects; TMIEs). Prey often employ multiple predator-avoidance behaviors, such as dispersal or reduced foraging activity, but estimates of TMIEs are usually on individual behaviors. We assessed direct and indirect predator effects in a mesocosm experiment using a marine food chain consisting of a predator (toadfish - Opsanus tau), prey (mud crab - Panopeus herbstii) and resource (ribbed mussel - Geukensia demissa). We measured dispersal and foraging activity of prey separately by manipulating both the presence and absence of the predator, and whether prey could or could not disperse into a predator-free area. Consumption of prey was 9 times greater when prey could not disperse, probably because mesocosm boundaries increased predator capture success. Although predator presence did not significantly affect the number of crabs that emigrated, the presence of a predator decreased resource consumption by prey, which resulted in fewer resources consumed for each prey that emigrated in the presence of a predator, and reduced the overall TMIE. When prey were unable to disperse, TMIEs on mussel survival were 3 times higher than the DMIEs. When prey were allowed to disperse, the TMIEs on resource survival increased to 11-times the DMIEs. We found that restricting the ability of prey to disperse, or focusing on only one predator-avoidance behavior, may be underestimating TMIEs. Our results indicate that the relative contribution of behavior and consumption in food chain dynamics will depend on which predator-avoidance behaviors are allowed to occur and measured.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Joint Conference on Limnology and Oceanography : Oceans, Rivers and Lakes - Energy and Substance Transfers at Interfaces
CL  - NANTES, FRANCE
AB  - This paper deals with the organic matter dynamics of a dwarf shrub species, Atriplex portulacoides, which characterizes the majority of ungrazed European salt marshes. These dynamics were investigated by the simultaneous estimation of primary production, litter production, decomposition processes and accumulation of organic matter in sediment. We used harvested biomass techniques and the litter-bag method, as well as more recent techniques such as determination of natural isotopic compositions. The results of this study have been compared with those of other studies of salt marshes of the Eastern Coast of America dominated by Spartina alterniflora.Studies of the fate of halophytic organic matter in salt marshes have shown that processes such as consumption, decomposition, or flooding rapidly could distribute organic material to different compartments of the marsh system. Aboveground productivity of A. portulacoides was 1700 g m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 80% of this production was transformed rapidly in necromass. A large part of this dead material (86%) fell as litter directly onto the sediment at the sampling site. The remainder was washed away by tides, either out of the marsh, or into the upper marsh where it accumulated in drift lines. Decomposition of A. portulacoides on the sediment was followed using litter-bags. Decay constants, based on the first order decay function, ranged between 0.0404 d(-1) and 0.0113 d(-1) and appeared high when compare with data obtained in other American and European salt marshes. Nitrogen immobilisation was not detectable in this decomposition experiment. During decay, nitrogen concentrations increased, whereas absolute amount of nitrogen decreased. After microbial decomposition, plant detritus was rapidly incorporated into sediment. The carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment showed that organic matter in the middle marsh came from both aboveground production of A. portulacoides and microalgae. The patterns for these two kinds of organic matter in different granulometric fractions depended on tidal submersion frequency. During the summer, when the salt marsh was not disturbed by tides, the clay fraction got richer in plant organic matter, whereas, during the other periods, this fraction was characterized by microalgal organic matter.This study provides new data about the dynamic of organic matter. It remains still difficult to establish comparisons between North American and European salt marsh functioning according to the variability of primary production, microbial decomposition and tidal range in these ecosystems.

TI  - Modelling sea level rise (SLR) impacts on salt marsh detrital outwelling C and N exports from an estuarine coastal lagoon to the ocean (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Review
AB  - Salt marshes are well-known sinks of carbon and nitrogen, incorporating them both into sediment and in the halophyte biomass, being key players in the estuarine biogeochemical cycles. Due to aboveground senescence there will inevitably occur losses of C and N rich detritus, becoming prone to the tidal flooding and hydrodynamic regime. On the other hand, the ongoing climate change effects, such as sea level rise (SLR) are known to have influence in the estuarine circulation. The Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal lagoon located in the Northwestern Portuguese coast, presenting a very complex geometry and characterized by large areas of salt marshes and tidal flats distributed along a web of narrow channels. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry, tidal dissipation and detritus Lagrangian trajectories were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario. The results here discussed show that in the case of Ria de Aveiro, the examined salt marsh exports about 15 kg Cm-2 y(-1) and 2 kg N m(-2) y(-1). Nowadays, Barra salt marsh presents the highest values of residual circulation, but predictions point out to its reduction due to SLR scenario. Barra salt marsh shows highly dynamic conditions by being exposed to higher current velocities, increased erosion rates and longer and more frequent inundation periods. This way, model results of Lagrangian particles indicate that the detrital particles are highly dispersed, with large amounts approaching the outer area of the lagoon, a feature that is highly enhanced in the SLR scenario. These features may have two major implications: (1) enhance the fuelling of secondary production in the coastal shelf and (2) excessive N exports and possible eutrophication of the coastal area. These two consequences (positive and negative) acquire even more importance if all the marsh extension along all the Ria de Aveiro is considered along with its elevated amount of plant-generated detritus. Regarding the present predictions and concerns on estuarine ecology in a global change framework, it becomes important to consider these estuarine salt marshes not only as possible nutrient sinks, but also as a potential N source enhanced by the ongoing climate changes.

TI  - Soil fungal communities vary with invasion by the exotic Spartina alternifolia Loisel. in coastal salt marshes of eastern China
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Soil fungal communities play a critical role in ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.

TI  - Estimating Global "Blue Carbon" Emissions from Conversion and Degradation of Vegetated Coastal Ecosystems
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent attention has focused on the high rates of annual carbon sequestration in vegetated coastal ecosystems-marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses-that may be lost with habitat destruction ('conversion'). Relatively unappreciated, however, is that conversion of these coastal ecosystems also impacts very large pools of previously-sequestered carbon. Residing mostly in sediments, this 'blue carbon' can be released to the atmosphere when these ecosystems are converted or degraded. Here we provide the first global estimates of this impact and evaluate its economic implications. Combining the best available data on global area, land-use conversion rates, and near-surface carbon stocks in each of the three ecosystems, using an uncertainty-propagation approach, we estimate that 0.15-1.02 Pg (billion tons) of carbon dioxide are being released annually, several times higher than previous estimates that account only for lost sequestration. These emissions are equivalent to 3-19% of those from deforestation globally, and result in economic damages of $US 6-42 billion annually. The largest sources of uncertainty in these estimates stems from limited certitude in global area and rates of land-use conversion, but research is also needed on the fates of ecosystem carbon upon conversion. Currently, carbon emissions from the conversion of vegetated coastal ecosystems are not included in emissions accounting or carbon market protocols, but this analysis suggests they may be disproportionally important to both. Although the relevant science supporting these initial estimates will need to be refined in coming years, it is clear that policies encouraging the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems could significantly reduce carbon emissions from the land-use sector, in addition to sustaining the well-recognized ecosystem services of coastal habitats.

T2  - FLORA

AB  - Interspecific variation of photosynthesis and water potential in inland salt marsh species has been largely unexplored. In this study, photosynthesis and water potential were measured in individuals of Spartina pectinata Link, Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, and Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla in an inland salt marsh, possibly the first field measures of photosynthesis in inland salt marsh plants in North America. It was hypothesized that the C-4 grasses S. pectinata and D. spicata would have a greater tolerance to salinity compared to the C-3 sedge B. maritimus by stomata being less responsive to changing water status. During the study, B. maritimus was most sensitive to dry conditions, which was manifested as low photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water potential. Stomatal closure occurred in all species under dry conditions, but particularly in B. maritimus. Under dry conditions, S. pectinata maintained higher photosynthesis compared to other species. Water potential was lower in D. spicata compared to the other species. There were significant correlations between plant water potential and photosynthesis and water potential and stomatal conductance in B. maritimus, but not in S. pectinata or D. spicata. This is evidence of sensitivity of B. maritimus to dry conditions and tolerance in S. pectinata and D. spicata, largely due to stomatal responses.

TI  - Ecological structure and function in a restored versus natural salt marsh
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Habitat reconstruction is commonly employed to restore degraded estuarine habitats and lost ecological functions. In this study, we use a combination of stable isotope analyses and macrofauna community analysis to compare the ecological structure and function between a recently constructed Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and a natural reference habitat over a 2-year period. The restored marsh was successful in providing habitat for economically and ecologically important macrofauna taxa; supporting similar or greater density, biomass, and species richness to the natural reference during all but one sampling period. Stable isotope analyses revealed that communities from the natural and the restored marshes relied on a similar diversity of food resources and that decapods had similar trophic levels. However, some generalist consumers (Palaemonetes spp. and Penaeus aztecus) were more 13C-enriched in the natural marsh, indicating a greater use of macrophyte derived organic matter relative to restored marsh counterparts. This difference was attributed to the higher quantities of macrophyte detritus and organic carbon in natural marsh sediments. Reduced marsh flooding frequency was associated with a reduction in macrofaunal biomass and decapod trophic levels. The restored marsh edge occurred at lower elevations than natural marsh edge, apparently due to reduced fetch and wind-wave exposure provided by the protective berm structures. The lower elevation of the restored marsh edge mitigated negative impacts in sampling periods with low tidal elevations that affected the natural marsh. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering sediment characteristics and elevation in salt marsh constructions. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Evaluation of salt marsh restoration by means of self-regulating tidal gate - Avon estuary, South Devon, UK
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide important regulating ecosystem services, including natural flood defence and carbon sequestration, which adds value to restoration and biodiversity offsetting schemes. This study evaluates the success of salt marsh restoration using a Regulated Tidal Exchange (RTE) system in SW England, i.e., a self-regulating tidal gate (SRT), in controlling the partial saline inundation of a 14-ha area of former salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture in 1760. A combination of (a) direct hydrodynamic monitoring of water and sediment flux and (b) repeat surveys to evaluate morphological and ecological (plants and foraminifera) changes over a 5-year period, was implemented immediately following SRT commissioning. Morphological changes were limited to the proximity of the SRT system due to limited sediment influx yielding sedimentation rates that were an order of magnitude below a nearby natural marsh. Ecological change to an ephemeral salt marsh community was only detected after 5 years of inundation cycles, with the delayed response attributed to (a) an initial limited tidal inundation due to conservative SRT settings, followed by (b) excessive inundation due to excessive rainfall and recurring SRT failure in an open position, and (c) a lack of sediment and propagule supply caused by (a) & (b) and the relatively narrow inlet pipe used in the SRT system. While the ecological response under optimum SRT settings was encouraging, the lack of perennial plants and limited foraminifera abundance demonstrated that the marsh was far from reaching natural status. We surmise that this is primarily due to inundation being more rapid than drainage leading to excessive submergence during a tidal cycle. Our study shows that the design of tidal inundation schemes requires a synergistic understanding of core ecological and geomorphological approaches to assess viability and success. We conclude that SRT can be a useful technique for intertidal habitat creation where there are significant site constraints (especially flood risk), but we need to be realistic in our expectations of what it can achieve in terms of delivering a perennial salt marsh community.

TI  - Effects of waterlogging and increased salinity on microbial communities and extracellular enzyme activity in native and exotic marsh vegetation soils
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to plant invasion and expected sea level rise in China. This study explored the responses of microbial communities and extracellular enzyme activity in the marsh soils of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora to waterlogging and increasing salinity (to mimic prolonged inundation and saltwater intrusion) based on the determination of phospholipid fatty acids and analysis of enzyme kinetics. The results showed that waterlogging and increased salinity treatments decreased the soil microbial biomass in both P. australis and S. alterniflora soils, with waterlogging exacerbating the negative effects of salinity. Fungi/bacteria ratios decreased under both waterlogging and salinity treatments, whereas actinomycetes/bacteria ratios increased with increasing salinity. The degree of the adverse effects of salinity on plant growth of S. alterniflora and soil microbial biomass was lower than that on P. australis. Generally, waterlogging treatment increased the activity of sucrase, cellulase, urease, and dehydrogenase in S. alterniflora soil. Increased salinity decreased all the assayed extracellular enzyme activity in both P. australis and S. alterniflora soils. The synergistic effects of waterlogging and increased salinity treatments on the enzyme activities in P. australis soil were significant, whereas only the effect on the cellulase activity was significant in S. alterniflora soil. This study indicated a greater ability of the microbial community and extracellular enzyme activity of S. alterniflora soil to adapt to waterlogging and increased salinity compared with those of P. australis soil due to the lower sensitivity of S. alterniflora growth and soil nutrients to stress.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distributions of Soil Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen in Two Marsh Wetlands with Different Flooding Frequencies of the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A field study was carried out in two typical marsh wetlands (Sites A and B) with different flooding frequencies in the Yellow River Delta of China in three different dates to investigate spatial and temporal distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) along the distance away from one tidal creek and the Yellow River, respectively. The results showed that SOC and TN contents and densities generally decreased with depth, except for an obvious accumulation peak of TN at the 2040?cm soil layer; and they had higher heterogeneity at both Sites A and B; However, SOC and TN contents and densities showed different spatial distribution patterns at both sites in different sampling dates. Generally, SOC and TN contents in marsh soils were higher at Site A than those at Site B. TN was significantly correlated with available phosphorous, SOC, and the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio at both sites, whereas SOC was significantly correlated with soil depth, soil moisture and salinity at both sites. Additionally, the C/N ratios were higher at Site B than those at Site A, and they were significantly correlated with soil moisture (Site A), bulk density, and TN (Sites A and B).

TI  - Responses of Contents and Structure of DOM to Spartina alterniflora Invasion in Yanghe Estuary Wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aimed to explore the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the contents and structure of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), and dissolved organic sulphur (DOS)) in the Yanghe estuary, by the aid of ultraviolet-visible spectrum, three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Soil samples were collected at 0-60 cm depths in different invasion years (0, 1, 5, and 8). The results showed that the DOC increased gradually with the increase of invasion time of S.alterniflora; whereas the contents of DON and DOP decreased. In the vertical section, all the DOM showed a decreasing trend with the increase of the soil profile except the DOC content in SAF-5 and SAF-8 plots (The SAF-5 and SAF-8 represent for the invasion time of 5 years and 8 years). The spectral analysis showed that the macromolecules of DOM increased after the invasion. The molecular weight and number of molecules of DOM changed after invasion. The changes were mainly concentrated in refractory macromolecules. S.alterniflora had a significant effect on the number of structural units and functional groups of soil DOM. The intensity of functional group peaks became stronger, and aromatic, aliphatic, and carbohydrate substances increased. In addition, the quantity and quality of soil DOM input by S.alternifolia strongly affect the complexity of DOM chemical structure. With the increase of invasion time, the degree of humification increases and the structure of DOM tends to be more complex. The findings of this study indicate that the invasion of S.alternifolia would enhance DOM owing to greater amount of biomass.

TI  - Evaluation of laser-based spectrometers for greenhouse gas flux measurements in coastal marshes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and rapid analyses of greenhouse gases (GHGs) will advance understanding of the net climatic forcing of coastal marsh ecosystems. We examined the ability of a cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer (Model G2508, Picarro) to measure carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in real-time from coastal marshes through comparisons with a Shimadzu GC-2014 ( GC) in a marsh mesocosm experiment and with a similar laser-based N2O analyzer (Model N2O/CO, Los Gatos Research) in both mesocosm and field experiments. Minimum (analytical) detectable fluxes for all gases were more than one order of magnitude lower for the Picarro than the GC. In mesocosms, the Picarro analyzer detected several CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes that the GC could not, but larger N2O fluxes (218-409 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were similar between analyzers. Minimum detectable fluxes for the Picarro were 1 order of magnitude higher than the Los Gatos analyzer for N2O. The Picarro and Los Gatos N2O fluxes (3-132 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) differed in two mesocosm nitrogen addition experiments, but were similar in a mesocosm with larger N2O fluxes (326-491 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). In a field comparison, Picarro and Los Gatos N2O fluxes (1362 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) differed in plots receiving low nitrogen loads but were similar in plots with higher nitrogen loads and fluxes roughly double in magnitude. Both the Picarro and Los Gatos analyzers offer efficient and precise alternatives to GC-based methods, but the former uniquely enables simultaneous measurements of three major GHGs in coastal marshes.

TI  - Variability of nutrient and particulate matter fluxes between the sea and a polder after partial tidal restoration, Northwestern France
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the patterns of exchanges of nutrients and suspended sediments between the sea and a polder, after partial tidal restoration, and to assess if these are comparable to those observed in natural salt marshes. The study site, situated in the Bay of Veys, in Northwestern France, was embanked in the 1870s and accidentally reconnected to the sea in 1990. Water now flows in and out of the polder by a single communication point with the sea, which facilitated water sampling and flux calculation for dissolved and particulate elements.The study was carried out for two years, from May 2002 to April 2004. Results showed that for all the months studied the water flowing out of the polder had lower concentrations of nitrates and suspended sediments, which lead to a retention of these elements throughout the year. Nitrates uptakes in the polder were much higher in winter (up to 473.9 g N ha(-1) tide(-1)) than in summer where they were close to zero. The retention of suspended sediment could be over 80% of the import and was mainly composed of organic matter. Finally, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were higher in outflow than inflow water, but due to unbalanced water budgets this lead to low quantities imported in summer and higher amounts exported for all other seasons. No interpretable pattern was observed for ammonium.The nature of these fluxes, according to literature, is close to those observed in immature salt marshes, so as far as restoration is concerned, it has been shown that partial tidal restoration can allow the restitution of the salt marsh exchange functions that were studied.

TI  - Post-mortem ecosystem engineering by oysters creates habitat for a rare marsh plant
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Oysters are ecosystem engineers in marine ecosystems, but the functions of oyster shell deposits in intertidal salt marshes are not well understood. The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.

TI  - Impacts of an alien species (Spartina alterniflora) on the macrobenthos community of Jiangsu coastal inter-tidal ecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora, a species vegetating on inter-tidal flats that was introduced from the eastern coast of United States, has become a hot topic, focusing on its invasion within local species in the coastal zone of China. Impacts of S. alterniflora on the inter-tidal macrobenthos community in the Jiangsu coastland are addressed by comparing the macrobenthos characteristics in a mudflat and in a four-year-old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. During the period October 2002-July 2003, we studied the distribution pattern and diversity of macrobenthos, and discussed their correlation with environmental factors caused by Spartina vegetation. The results showed that a total of 43 macrobenthos species were found, mainly consisting of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Annelida. Ten macrobenthos species were found in the Spartina salt marsh, and 36 species were found in the mudflat. Life forms and functional groups of macrobenthos in the Spartina salt marsh were obviously distrinct from that of the mudflat. The study showed that macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh decreased, and the community structure altered obviously, whereas the biomass showed no differences in different seasons. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seasonal change of macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh negatively related to content of sediment organic matter, total N, bulk density, height and biomass of Spartina vegetation, and positively related to the density of Spartina. All these differences suggested the obvious effects of the Spartina vegetation on the Jiangsu inter-tidal benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. Furthermore, the investigation also showed that the niche of the native macrobenthos living in the mudflat has been transferred down, seaward, due to the invasion of Spartina in our study site.

TI  - Rapid carbon accumulation following managed realignment on the Bay of Fundy
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and reclaimed for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canadas Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

TI  - The pace of ecosystem development of constructed Spartina alterniflora marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological attributes were measured along a chronosequence of 1- to 28-yr-old, constructed Spartina alterniflora marshes to identify trajectories and rates of ecosystem development of wetland structure and function. Attributes related to biological productivity and diversity (Spartina, epiphytic and sediment algae, benthic invertebrates), soil development (sediment deposition, organic C, N, P, organic matter quality), and microbial processes (C mineralization) were compared among eight constructed marshes and eight paired natural reference marshes. Most ecological attributes developed in a predictable manner over time, and most achieved equivalence to natural marshes 5-15 yr after marsh construction. An exception was soil organic C and N pools (0-30 cm) that, after 28 yr, were significantly lower in constructed marshes. Development of habitat structure (Spartina stem height and density) and biodiversity (algae and invertebrates) developed concurrently with functional characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll a, and invertebrate density. Processes related to hydrology, sediment deposition and soil C and N accumulation, developed almost instantaneously with the establishment of Spartina, and young (1- to 3-yr-old), constructed marshes trapped sediment and sequestered N at higher rates than comparable reference marshes. Development of heterotrophic activity (C mineralization, invertebrate density) was strongly linked to surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C content. Ecosystem development of constructed (and natural) salt marshes depended on a minimum of 100 9 N/m(2) (0.05-0.1% N) to support emergent vegetation and 1000 g C/m(2) (0.5-1% C) to sustain the heterotrophic community.

TI  - Bedload and nearbed detritus transport in a tidal saltmarsh creek
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bedload and nearbed transport of coarse (>1 mm) detritus particles were investigated in a tidal creek of a salt marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (south-west Netherlands). Using a fyke net positioned on the creek bottom, hourly transport through the creek was measured during 14 flood-ebb cycles in 1990 and 1991. Transport was bidirectional with flood imports varying between 32 and 2601 g dry weight (DW), and ebb exports varying between 0 and 4737 g DW. In nine of 14 tidal cycles, the creek was functioning as a net exporting system. The material that was exported with the ebb consisted mainly of macrophyte material. The annual loss of coarse organic matter by bedload plus nearbed transport through the creek was estimated to be less than 0.2% of the estimated annual above-ground plant biomass production in the drainage area of the creek. Therefore, it is concluded that this type of detritus transport is probably insignificant for the carbon balance of the salt marsh. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

TI  - Litter pool sizes, decomposition, and nitrogen dynamics in Spartina alterniflora-invaded and native coastal marshlands of the Yangtze Estuary
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Past studies have focused primarily on the effects of invasive plants on litter decomposition at soil surfaces. In natural ecosystems, however, considerable amounts of litter may be at aerial and belowground positions. This study was designed to examine the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the pool sizes and decomposition of aerial, surficial, and belowground litter in coastal marshlands, the Yangtze Estuary, which were originally occupied by two native species, Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis. We collected aerial and surficial litter of the three species once a month and belowground litter once every 2 months. We used the litterbag method to quantify litter decomposition at the aerial, surficial and belowground positions for the three species. Yearly averaged litter mass in the Spartina stands was 1.99 kg m(-2); this was 250 and 22.8% higher than that in the Scirpus (0.57 kg m(-2)) and Phragmites (1.62 kg m(-2)) stands, respectively. The litter in the Spartina stands was primarily distributed in the air (45%) and belowground (48%), while Scirpus and Phragmites litter was mainly allocated to belowground positions (85 and 59%, respectively). The averaged decomposition rates of aerial, surficial, and belowground litter were 0.82, 1.83, and 1.27 year(-1) for Spartina, respectively; these were 52, 62 and 69% of those for Scirpus litter at corresponding positions and 158, 144 and 78% of those for Phragmites litter, respectively. The differences in decomposition rates between Spartina and the two native species were largely due to differences in litter quality among the three species, particularly for the belowground litter. The absolute amount of nitrogen increased during the decomposition of Spartina stem, sheath and root litter, while the amount of nitrogen in Scirpus and Phragmites litter declined during decomposition for all tissue types. Our results suggest that Spartina invasion altered the carbon and nitrogen cycling in the coastal marshlands of China.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic importance of microphytobenthos (MPB), phytoplankton, C-3 vascular plants and invasive Spartina alterniflora in benthic and pelagic food webs was studied in Jiuduansha, a newly formed salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, using natural stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses and IsoSource evaluation. MPB was found to be the major food source of meiofauna and important in the diets of macrofaunal consumers. Carbon derived from C-3 vascular plants significantly contributed to the nutrition of all planktonic copepods and supported planktivorous nekton, but played a minor role in the benthic food web. Although phytoplankton could be utilized by all the consumers, low production in this highly turbid estuary might restrict its relative importance. High trophic-level consumers could get carbon from C-13-enriched MPB and C-13-depleted C-3 plants via zoobenthos and zooplankton, respectively. Neither benthic nor pelagic animals fed exclusively on S. alterniflora except for a gastropod species in the present study, indicating a minor contribution of this invasive C-4 plant to the food web of the Jiuduansha salt marsh. In light of the degradation of salt marshes in the Yangtze River estuary, the rapid expansion of this invasive C-4 plant may alter the nutrient foundation of resident and migratory consumers and thus significantly impact the ecosystem there.

TI  - Long-term changes in topsoil chemical properties under centuries of cultivation after reclamation of coastal wetlands in the Yangtze Estuary, China
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of reclaimed coastal wetland soils under cultivation has not been well understood, especially at temporal scales longer than a century. In this study, we analyzed major chemical properties of plow-layer soils extensively sampled under two cropping systems (paddy rice vs. upland cropping) along a 500-year soil chronosequence created by intermittent reclamation of coastal salt marshes. The results suggested a rapid desalinization of soil immediately after reclamation. During 500 years of cultivation, the decalcification process lowered soil pH from >8 to nearly neutral. Soil organic carbon (SOC) contents markedly declined in the initial 16 years, but then rapidly recovered within 30 years and thereafter slowly accumulated with cultivation duration. Meanwhile, the recalcitrance of SOC increased. Soil nutrient status was enhanced after centuries of cultivation as indicated by the improved total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorous (TP). Amorphous Fe oxyhydrates progressively decreased, but the crystallinity of Fe oxyhydrates increased with cultivation time. Cropping system greatly affected plow-layer soil properties, with paddy soils having higher SOC. MBC, NH4OAc-extractable Ca2+, but lower TP, NH4OAc-extractable K, potentially mineralizable nitrogen and Fe crystallinity than upland soils. Most soil properties revealed clear temporal patterns with more remarkable changes occurring in the first several decades after reclamation than in the following centuries. In conclusion, there was a transition phase of the soil system within the first several decades after reclamation of coastal wetlands, possibly harmful to agricultural production, but centuries of cultivation seemed to have significantly improved overall soil fertility.

TI  - Creek Dynamics Determine Pond Subsurface Geochemical Heterogeneity in East Anglian (UK) Salt Marshes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are complex systems comprising ephemerally flooded, vegetated platforms hydraulically fed by tidal creeks. Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a pond's proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Modeling the influence of hydroperiod and vegetation on the cross-sectional formation of tidal channels
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - hThe evolution of the cross section of a salt-marsh channel is explored using a numerical model. Deposition on the marsh platform and erosion and deposition in the channel affect the tidal prism flowing through the cross section, such that the model captures the evolution of the stage-discharge relationship as the channel and marsh platform evolve. The model also captures the growth of salt-marsh vegetation on the marsh platform, and how this vegetation affects flow resistance and the rate of sedimentation. The model is utilized to study the influence of hydroperiod and vegetation encroachment on channel cross section. Numerical results show that a reduction in hydroperiod due to the emergence of the marsh platform causes an infilling of the channel. Vegetation encroachment on the marsh surface produces an increase in flow resistance and accretion due to organic and mineral sedimentation, with important consequences for the shape of the channel cross section. Finally, modeling results indicate that in microtidal marshes with vegetation dominated by Spartina alterniflora, the width-to-depth ratio of the channels decreases when the tidal flats evolve in salt marshes, whereas the cross-sectional area remains proportional to the tidal peak discharge throughout channel evolution.

TI  - Effects of Tidal Scenarios on the Methane Emission Dynamics in the Subtropical Tidal Marshes of the Min River Estuary in Southeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to accurately estimate the effects of tidal scenarios on the CH4 emission from tidal wetlands, we examined the CH4 effluxes, dissolved CH4 concentrations, and environmental factors (including in situ pH, Eh and electrical conductivity, porewater SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) during inundation and air-exposure periods in high- and low-tide seasons in the Min River Estuary in southeast China. By applying static and floating chambers, our results showed that the CH4 effluxes during the inundation periods were relatively constant and generally lower than those during the air-exposed periods in both seasons. When compared, the CH4 effluxes during the air-exposed periods were significantly higher in the high-tide season than those in the low-tide season. In contrast, CH4 effluxes during the inundation periods were significantly lower in the high-tide season than those in the low-tide season. During the inundation periods, dissolved CH4 concentrations were inversely proportional to in situ Eh. Under air-exposed conditions, CH4 effluxes were proportional to in situ pH in both seasons, while the dissolved CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with the porewater SO42- concentrations in both seasons. Our results highlighted that CH4 effluxes were more dynamic between inundation and air-exposure periods compared to low- and high-tide seasons.

AB  - Data from Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh are used to gauge the extent of change of Spartina alterniflora marsh during periods of several to 22 yr. Our data all relate to plant production: from aboveground, maximum plant biomass measured over the entire period; from belowground, live root and rhizome biomass measured in 1974 and 1983, CO2 evolution from the sediments for 7 yr, and pore-water concentrations of dissolved sulfide for 6 yr. All the measures indicated a relatively low degree of interannual change in salt-marsh areas vegetated by tall- and short-form S. alterniflora. The similarity in both plant and biogeochemical parameters between years is likely related to the regular, high-frequency tidal flooding of grass stands. These interannual comparisons of each quantified parameter support the contention that measurements made in any single year can be applied to other years with suitable precautions to account for seasonal cycles. Our data also illustrate the importance of long time series for establishing sound correlations in environmental data.

AB  - Field investigations and indoor experiment were carried out to clarify the effect of temperature and chlorophyll a concentration of the sediment, photon flux density, and ground water level on the absorption and emission of CO2 from the surface sediment of the artificial salt marsh. The flux of CO2 absorption was closely related to sediment temperature, chlorophyll a and photon flux density. On the other hand, flux of CO2 emission changed depending on the sediment temperature and ground water level. The ground water level was thought to be indispensable for estimating CO2 emission from the sediment of the intertidal zone of the salt marsh. Using equations of CO2 flux with sediment temperature, chlorophyll a, photon flux density and ground water level, the total CO2 absorption and emission of the artificial north salt marsh of Osaka Nanko bird sanctuary was estimated as ca. 23 tons (4.3 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) for absorption and ca.14 tons (2.6 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) for emission in May to September 2014. These results suggest that a net of 9 tons of CO2 (1.7 g CO2 M-2 day(-1)) was absorbed, and that this salt marsh performs the function of a CO2 sink in high temperature seasons.

TI  - Influence of salt marsh on bacterial activity in two estuaries with different hydrodynamic characteristics (Ria de Aveiro and Tagus Estuary)
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of salt marsh on estuarine bacterioplankton was investigated in two estuaries with different hydrodynamic characteristics (Ria de Aveiro and Tagus Estuary). In the Ria de Aveiro, bacteria in the flood water overlying the marsh were two times more abundant and five to six times more active than in the main channel. In the Tagus Estuary, bacterial abundance was similar in flooding and channel water, but bacterial activity was up to two times higher in the main channel. The two salt marshes have distinct influences on estuarine bacterioplankton abundance and activity. In the Ria de Aveiro, salt marsh enhanced estuarine bacterial communities, increasing their size and stimulating their activity. By contrast, the salt marsh in the Tagus Estuary does not seem to increase the bacterial abundance and production in the channel water. These distinct influences may be explained by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the salt marshes, which were confirmed by the hydrodynamic model implemented for both systems.

TI  - Carbon Balance in Salt Marsh and Mangrove Ecosystems: A Global Synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the global coastal ocean. Mangroves store more carbon (739 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)) than salt marshes (334 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)), but the latter sequester proportionally more (24%) net primary production (NPP) than mangroves (12%). Mangroves exhibit greater rates of gross primary production (GPP), aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and plant respiration (R-C), with higher P-GPP/R-C ratios, but salt marshes exhibit greater rates of below-ground NPP (BGNPP). Mangroves have greater rates of subsurface DIC production and, unlike salt marshes, exhibit active microbial decomposition to a soil depth of 1 m. Salt marshes release more CH4 from soil and creek waters and export more dissolved CH4, but mangroves release more CO2 from tidal waters and export greater amounts of particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), to adjacent waters. Both ecosystems contribute only a small proportion of GPP, R-E (ecosystem respiration) and NEP (net ecosystem production) to the global coastal ocean due to their small global area, but contribute 72% of air-sea CO2 exchange of the world's wetlands and estuaries and contribute 34% of DIC export and 17% of DOC + POC export to the world's coastal ocean. Thus, both wetland ecosystems contribute disproportionately to carbon flow of the global coastal ocean.

Age models, based on excess lead-210 and cesium-137 radionuclide analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. The Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) age model was used to date six cores collected from three salt marshes. Both vertical accretion rates and carbon burial increased from 1900 to 2016, the year the data were collected. Cores were up to 90 cm in length with dry bulk density ranging from 0.07 to 3.08 grams per cubic centimeter and carbon content 0.71 percent to 33.58 percent.

TI  - Salt Marsh and Fringing Oyster Reef Transgression in a Shallow Temperate Estuary: Implications for Restoration, Conservation and Blue Carbon
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of intertidal estuarine habitats, like salt marsh and oyster reef, has been well established, as has their ubiquitous loss along our coasts with resultant forfeiture of the ecosystem services they provide. Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef's relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.

T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 3.1 m sediment core was analyzed for stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter and higher plant leaf wax (HPLW) lipid biomarkers to determine Holocene shifts in C-3 (higher high marsh) and C-4 (low and/or high marsh) plant deposition at the Sprague River Salt Marsh, Phippsburg, Maine. The carbon isotope composition of the bulk sediment and the HPLW parallel each other throughout most of the core, suggesting that terrestrial plants are an important source of organic matter to the sediments, and diagenetic alteration of the bulk sediments is minimal. The current salt marsh began to form 2500 cal yr BP. Low and/or high C-4 marsh plants dominated deposition at 2000 cal yr BP, 700 cal yr BP, and for the last 200 cal yr BP. Expansion of higher high marsh C-3 plants occurred at 1300 and 600 cal yr BP. These major vegetation shifts result from a combination of changes in relative sea-level rise and sediment accumulation rates.Average annual carbon sequestration rates for the last 2500 years approximate 40 g C yr(-1) m(-2), and are in strong agreement with other values published for the Gulf of Maine. Given that Maine salt marshes cover an area of similar to 79 km, they represent an important component of the terrestrial carbon sink. More detailed isotopic and age records from a network of sediment cores at Sprague Marsh are needed to truly evaluate the long term changes in salt marsh plant communities and the impact of more recent human activity, including global warming, on salt marsh vegetation.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of benthic macrofauna (Nereis diversicolor) and macrophytes (Spartina anglica) on the dynamics of microbial mineralization rates and pathways in saltmarsh sediment was studied over 1 growing season. Measurements were conducted in 4 saltmarsh mesocosms subjected to a natural tidal regime, and inhabited by either flora, fauna or both,or kept without the presence of, macroorganisms. Total benthic mineralization was measured during spring, summer and fall as sediment oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release under air-exposed as well as inundated conditions, while anaerobic mineralization was quantified as sulfate reduction. Porewater concentration profiles of total carbon dioxide (TCO2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), SO42-, Cl- and Fe2+, were determined monthly. The presence of fauna had minor effects on plant growth, while sediment vegetated by S. anglica renders the habitat unsuitable for N. diversicolor, possibly due to food limitation. Without the presence of macroorganisms, a dense algal mat (Vaucheria sp.) developed on the sediment surface. As a result, the sediment was greatly reduced with benthic respiration completely dominated by sulfate reduction. Grazing by fauna (N. diversicolor) kept the sediment surface free of epibenthic microalgae, and irrigation oxidized the top 15 to 20 cm of the sediment by enhancing porewater exchange with overlying water. Porewater TCO2, DOC and Fe 21 only accumulated below 15 to 20 cm depth. Sulfate reduction was still the dominating degradation pathway, accounting for 50 to 60% of the total microbial mineralization. The presence of flora (S. anglica) enhanced total microbial mineralization but lowered the importance of sulfate reduction (22 to 54%). Porewater constituents such as DOC and TCO2 were kept low and relatively evenly distributed with depth. The oxidizing capacity of S. anglica was evident throughout the sediment column. The presence of both flora and fauna produced the largest increase in oxic as well as total microbial mineralization rates. In conclusion, the mesocosm approach simulated natural salt marsh conditions well, and the results provide good evidence for the interactions between flora and fauna as well as their impact on sediment geochemistry.

TI  - The soil nitrogen dynamics in an inland salt marsh as affected by various experimental water levels
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - An 87-day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of various water levels on the soil nitrogen content in an inland salt marsh of Xianghai, China. Soil samples were collected from depths in the range of 0 to 30 cm at 10-cm intervals after 15, 54 and 87 days of incubation. The total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) contents and the nitrogen activation coefficient (NAC) were measured to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics under three inundation treatments (-5, 0 and 5 cm). The results showed that TN was generally accumulated in all soil layers and exhibited a peak value in subsurface soils at the -5-cm inundation level at the end of the incubation period, whereas no obvious changes were observed in the TN contents in the bottom soils at the three inundation levels. Compared with the initial contents in the soils, the NO3--N and NH4+-N contents were significantly reduced in all soil layers at the 0-cm and the 5-cm inundation levels at the end of the incubation period. In general, the available nitrogen content was higher in the surface soils compared with the deeper soils at all inundation levels. The NAC values exhibited a pronounced change in the subsurface soils at all inundation levels, decreasing significantly from 0.17 to 0.04 at the 5-cm inundation level; however, a higher mean NAC value (0.126) was found over the incubation period at the 0-cm inundation level compared with the 5-cm and the -5-cm inundation levels. Nitrogen was released from plants into the soil under all inundation treatments over the incubation period. The soil organic matter exerted positive loadings on the TN and NO3--N contents and negative loadings on the NH4+-N content at all inundation levels, and the water content generally exhibited a negative relationship with all forms of nitrogen. Additionally, the total phosphorus content exhibited a positive correlation with the TN and NO3--N contents. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effects of landuse change of coastal tidal flat on the bio-available phosphorus in soils
T2  - Huanjing Huaxue-Environmental Chemistry
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the effects of landuse change of coastal tidal flat on the bio-available phosphorus (BAP) in soils, total phosphorus (TP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), organic phosphorus, and several BAPs (Olsen-P, M3-P, WSP, and Lo-P) were analyzed in the process of transformation from the pristine salt marsh to reclaimed farmlands. Results showed that concentrations of TP, IP and OP in soils increased significantly (by 19%, 12%, and 55%, respectively) after transformation from the pristine salt marsh to reclaimed farmlands. The ratio of IP/TP decreased significantly, and the ratios of OP/TP and OP/IP increased significantly, which suggested the cumulative rate of OP was clearly higher than TP and IP in the process of landuse change of tidal flat. The concentrations and ratios of BAPs in tidal flat soils increased significantly after transformation to reclaimed farmlands. The concentrations of Olsen-P, M3-P, WSP, and Lo-P increased by 282%, 379%, 275%, and 192%, respectively, and the ratios increased by 205%, 267%, 217%, and 142%, respectively. The increase of BAPs was far higher than TP, IP and OP. BAPs had significantly positive correlations with TP, IP, and organic carbon (TOC), and significantly negative correlation with soil salinity. The above results showed that the landuse change of tidal flat from the pristine salt marsh to reclaimed farmlands could raise greatly the BAP levels in soils,and the environmental consequences of which were worthy of attention.

TI  - Considerations of habitat linkages, estuarine landscapes, and the trophic spectrum in wetland restoration design
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland restoration designs do not frequently consider functional linkages among habitats in the estuarine landscape, nor do they focus sufficient attention on the role of marsh morphology in promoting the efficient exchange of materials and organisms between the intertidal and subtidal water column. These features should be considered, because many marine organisms may benefit from trophic subsidies from adjacent habitats without ever entering them. Stable isotopes were used to examine trophic linkages between primary producers and marine finfishes to highlight the importance of individual life history traits and to punctuate the argument for promoting habitat connectivity (exchange of materials and organisms) in restoration planning. We demonstrate that the trophic spectrum of an estuarine resident, the Moreno americana (white perch), and two marine transients, Anchoa mitchilli (bay anchovy) and Cynoscion regalis (weakfish), are largely functions of locally available organic matter distributed along a gradient of estuarine resources. In both salt marshes and open waters, there was a transition in whole-body isotopic composition in all three species associated with the estuary-wide gradient in nutrient availability ranging from macrophytes and benthic microalgae in marshes, to phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) in the open estuary. As anticipated, phytoplankton contributed more to bay anchovy and weakfish biomass, especially in open waters, than to white perch. Our results also suggest that marine transients benefit from the presence of salt marshes without necessarily occupying them. Thus the estuarine "commissary" serves up different recipes in different regions, and the many estuarine-dependent species apparently take full advantage of these varied sources of primary production at the base of the food web when seeking energy for rapid growth and survival.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics and changing sea level as determinants of the community and trophic structure of oribatid mites in a salt marsh of the Wadden Sea
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change processes affect seasonal dynamics of salt marshes and thereby their plant and animal communities. However, these changes have been little investigated for microarthropod communities. We studied the effect of seasonality and changes in sea level on oribatid mites in the natural salt marsh and on artificial islands in the back-barrier environment of the island Spiekeroog (Wadden Sea, Germany). Three zones of the artificial islands were filled with transplanted sods from the lower salt marsh zone and thereby exposed to three different inundation frequencies. We hypothesized that oribatid mite communities will differ along the natural salt marsh vegetation zones [ upper salt marsh (USM), lower salt marsh (LSM), pioneer zone (PZ)], which are influenced by different tidal regimes. Accordingly, total oribatid mite densities declined from the USM and LSM to the PZ. Similarly, oribatid mite species compositions changed along the salt marsh transect and also responded to variations in inundation frequency in LSM on artificial islands with typical species of the USM, LSM and PZ being Multioppia neglecta (USM), Hermannia pulchella (LSM), Zachvatkinibates quadrivertex (LSM, PZ) and Ameronothrus schneideri (LSM, PZ). Oribatid mite density in the salt marsh and on the artificial islands was at a maximum in winter and spring; this was due in part to high density of juveniles, pointing to two reproductive periods. We hypothesized that oribatid mite trophic structure changes due to variations in abiotic (e.g., tidal dynamics, temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., resource availability). Stable isotope (N-15, C-13) and neutral lipid fatty acid analyses indicated that oribatid mite species have different diets with e.g., Z. quadrivertex feeding on macroalgae and fungi, A. schneideri feeding on microalgae and bacteria, and Scheloribates laevigatus and M. neglecta feeding on dead organic matter, bacteria and fungi. Overall, the results indicate that oribatid mite species in salt marshes are affected by changes in environmental factors such as inundation intensity, with the effects being most pronounced in species with narrow trophic niches and limited niche plasticity. The results also indicate that oribatid mite communities of the LSM respond little to short-term (one year) changes in inundation frequency.

TI  - Response of gaseous carbon emissions to low-level salinity increase in tidal marsh ecosystem of the Min River estuary, southeastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) emission, and environmental factors, with respect to estuarine marshes, has not been clarified thoroughly. This study investigated the crucial factors controlling the emission of CO2 and CH4 from a freshwater marsh and a brackish marsh located in a subtropical estuary in southeastern China, as well as their magnitude. The duration of the study period was November 2013 to October 2014. Relevant to both the field and incubation experiments, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from the two marshes showed pronounced seasonal variations. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from both marshes demonstrated significant positive correlations with the air/soil temperature (p < 0.01), but negative correlations with the soil electrical conductivity and the pore water/tide water Cl- and SO42- (p < 0.01). The results indicate no significant difference in the CO2 emissions between the freshwater and brackish marshes in the subtropical estuary, whereas there was a difference in the CH4 emissions between the two sites (p < 0.01). Although future sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion could reduce the CH4 emissions from the estuarine freshwater marshes, these factors had little effect on the CO2 emissions with respect to an increase in salinity of less than 5%. The findings of this study could have important implications for estimating the global warming contributions of estuarine marshes along differing salinity gradients.

TI  - Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Heterogeneity of Atriplex portulacoides (L) Aellen productivity in a macrotidal salt marsh
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE III-SCIENCES DE LA VIE-LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atriplex portulacoides is one of the most frequent species on natural salt marshes along the French coasts and appears to be an important source of organic matter potentially available for exportation towards coastal sea waters. We followed the evolution of the biomass of this species in a macrotidal salt marsh in the ''baie du Mont-Saint-Michel'' for 3 years and at different locations in the marsh, in order to determine spatial and inter-annual variations of its productivity. Generally, Atriplex portulacoides presented a higher production in the most frequently flooded area, where environmental conditions appeared to be optimal. However, during a specific year in which a micro-lepidoptera invaded the lower part of the marsh, the primary production of Atriplex portulacoides decreased in this area. Even though this vegetation type present an apparent homogeneity, it appears important to take into account the variation of its primary production in any studies about salt-marsh functioning and exchanges with sea waters.

CP  - 1st International Conference on Southern European Coastal Lagoons

AB  - The nereid polychaete Hediste diversicolor was frequently used as biomonitor of heavy metals contamination in estuaries. In the present work, the bioaccumulation of five heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb) in tissues of H. diversicolor collected from six salt marshes in the lagoon of Venice is studied by analysing the relationships between concentrations of the operationally-defined reactive fraction of trace metals in sediments and total concentrations in tissues. The characterisation of sediment samples shows a clear distinction between sites near and far from the Industrial Zone; no analogous pattern is observed for tissue concentrations suggesting that metal bioaccumulation is controlled by complex interactions between metal bioavailability and physiological factors. Considering relationships between metals, strong inverse correlations are observed in polychaetes and sediments for Cu and Cr concentrations suggesting a possible interaction between these two metals. The role played by organic matter (OM) in the availability of metal is highlighted considering inverse relationships found between bioaccumulation factors for Cu, Cr, Cd and OM.

T2  - Journal of Ecology and Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Salt marshes provide a variety of ecosystem services; however, they are vulnerable to human activity, water level fluctuations, and climate change. Analyses of the relationships between plant communities and environmental conditions in salt marshes are expected to provide useful information for the prediction of changes during climate change. In this study, relationships between the current vegetation structure and environmental factors were evaluated in the tidal flat at the southern tip of Ganghwa, Korea, where salt marshes are well-developed. Results The vegetation structure in Ganghwa salt marshes was divided into three groups by cluster analysis: group A, dominated by Phragmites communis; group B, dominated by Suaeda japonica; and group C, dominated by other taxa. As determined by PERMANOVA, the groups showed significant differences with respect to altitude, soil moisture, soil organic matter, salinity, sand, clay, and silt ratios. A canonical correspondence analysis based on the percent cover of each species in the quadrats showed that the proportion of sand increased as the altitude increased and S. japonica appeared in soil with a relatively high silt proportion, while P. communis was distributed in soil with low salinity. Conclusions The distributions of three halophyte groups differed depending on the altitude, soil moisture, salinity, and soil organic matter, sand, silt, and clay contents. Pioneer species, such as S. japonica, appeared in soil with a relatively high silt content. The P. communis community survived under a wider range of soil textures than previously reported in the literature; the species was distributed in soils with relatively low salinity, with a range expansion toward the sea in areas with freshwater influx. The observed spatial distribution patterns may provide a basis for conservation under declining salt marshes.

TI  - Alginate Addition Influences Smooth Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) Growth and Macroinvertebrate Densities
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In nitrogen-limited temperate marshes, increasing nitrogen availability via biological mechanisms such as N-2 fixation and organic matter mineralization may lead to elevated marsh plant growth and macroinvertebrate densities. A polysaccharide, alginate, known to enhance microbial activity was added to sediment in a salt marsh (GA, USA) and the responses of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and densities of common macroinvertebrates with important roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow through detrital systems were examined. Plant characteristics and macroinvertebrate densities were measured over portions of two growing seasons between July 2007 and July 2008. Spartina alterniflora stem densities increased in the alginate treatment compared to controls after six weeks of exposure, and this difference was evident throughout the second growing season. Differences in plant heights emerged during the second growing season. Positive effects on Geukensia demissa densities occurred during both growing seasons, Littoraria irrorata densities were elevated relative to controls only in the second growing season, and no differences were observed for Uca pugnax. This potential for increased marsh productivity following carbon amendments may be useful in developing plans for salt marsh recovery.

TI  - Patterns of development in the creekbank region of a barrier island Spartina alterniflora marsh
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical factors, such as local geomorphology and hydrology, are the primary determinants of biological pattern and process in a salt marsh. The increased topographic relief associated with the creekbank region is thought to control the unique chemistry and productivity found there. This study was designed to examine the role that tidal creeks play-during the natural development of a barrier island Spartina alterniflora marsh ecosystem on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA. A salt marsh chronosequence, resulting from a 1962 overwash event, was used as a 'space-for-time' substitution in order to define the changes that take place within this marsh over a successional time scale. The chronosequence of marshes is largely attributed to the variation in elevation across the overwash platform: younger marshes are higher relative to sea level. We used a principal components analysis on a suite of physico-chemical and biological variables. A single principle component explained 53% of the variability in the data and is used to describe the functional trajectory along which these marshes develop. This component is associated with an increase in sediment organic matter and nitrogen content (%N), porewater nutrients, S. alterniflora height, weight, %flowering and %N, and a decrease in grain size and redox potential. The factor scores from this analysis, which were used as a proxy for the functional maturity of the marsh, increased from creek edge to interior marsh for young marsh sites. Thus, the marsh nearest the creek most resembles the mature marsh. The temporal patterns of creek-water physico-chemistry vary between different aged creeks, suggesting that due to their small size and shallow depth younger creeks act to retain nutrients and particulates within the marsh. The hydrological, chemical and biological processes within the creeks themselves and at the creekbank are important in controlling the overall rate of marsh development. While creeks act to accelerate the rate of maturation, our results also indicate that not all marshes follow the same developmental trajectory and that the regional landscape may be a more important factor. With the increased interest in marsh restoration and creation for the mitigation of coastal wetland loss, there is a need for a greater functional understanding of the factors that control marsh development. The results of this study suggest that increasing creek frontage will increase the rate at which created marshes achieve functional equivalence with mature marshes.

TI  - Estimating the Potential Blue Carbon Gains From Tidal Marsh Rehabilitation: A Case Study From South Eastern Australia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, coastal "blue carbon" ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) have been impacted and degraded by human intervention, mainly in the form of land acquisition. With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and Pb-210 dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered ("control") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha(-1) year(-1)). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of similar to 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or similar to 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

TI  - The role of above- and below-ground components of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) and detritus biomass in structuring macrobenthic associations of Paranagua Bay (SE, Brazil)
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of Spartina alterniflora marshes and detritus availability on the spatial structure and time variability of macrobenthic associations was investigated in Paranagua Bay, a subtropical estuary in southern Brazil. Four sampling sites were established along the salinity and exposure gradient of Paranagua Bay in the winter and summer of 1992. At each site, 5 samples (0.02 m(2)corer) were taken in the salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated tidal flats. Sediment composition, salt marsh structure (stem height and density, live and dead above- and below-ground biomass of S. alterniflora) and vegetal detritus biomass were determined to assess whether they can affect the dynamics of macrobenthic invertebrates. The development of salt marshes and the amount of detritus, the latter mainly originated from adjacent mangroves, were determined by the energy and salinity gradients along the bay. Plant above- and below-ground components, together with detritus biomass, exert a strong influence on the composition and distribution of macrofauna in Paranagua Bay. Salt marshes support higher densities and species number of macrobenthic invertebrates. Multivariate analyses showed that oscillations of different fractions of Spartina alterniflora, as well as detritus availability, affect the different components of macrobenthic associations in a variable degree. Spatial and temporal shifts of infaunal organisms appear to be more evident than those of mobile epibenthic forms.

TI  - Effects of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Addition on Photosynthesized Carbon Allocation in Spartina alterniflora-Soil System
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes of C-13 content in C-13 pulse-labeled Spartina alternflora plants and root soil organic carbon were analyzed under different levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The effects of N and P addition levels on the distribution and fixation of photosynthetic carbon in S. alterniflora-soil system were studied. The results show that the abundance of C-13 in each treatment group was significantly increased after four pulse marks. Except for the treatment of NP1, the abundance of C-13 showed a decreasing trend in the order of stem, leaf, root, rhizosphere soil and soil, which was consistent with the control group (CK). The total amount of C-13 fixed in each treatment group show a trend of continuous increase, but it was lower than that of the control group. The average fixed C-13 amount of NP treatment was higher than that of N or P treatment alone. During the development of plants, the proportion of photosynthetic carbon in the aboveground gradually decreased while the proportion of underground gradually increased, and the accumulation of organic carbon C-13 in soil was enhanced. With the development of plants, the differences in the distribution of C-13 in each part of S. alterniflora-soil system became similar and tend to be consistent. In the N-added group, the allocation ratio of carbon in rhizosphere soil and soil increased with the increase of N addition level, indicating that N application could promote the transfer of photosynthetic carbon to soil. In the P-added group, the highest underground allocation ratio of photosynthetic carbon was observed in the medium level of P addition treatment (P2), which was conducive to the underground transfer of photosynthetic carbon. In the NP-added group, the aboveground distribution ratio was the highest at medium NP level (NP2), and the distribution ratio of rhizosphere soil and soil increased with the increase of NP addition. The addition levels of N and P and types of nutrients can change the distribution of photosynthetic carbon in S. alterniflora-soil system, indicating that eutrophication had significant ecological effects on the carbon cycle in salt marsh ecosystem.

TI  - Impacts of sea-level rise on sediment microbial community structure and function in two New England salt marshes, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing evidence for a tight linkage between the structure and function of microbial communities and for the importance of this relationship in ecosystem responses to disturbances such as sea-level rise (SLR). While the role of plants in determining the capacity of salt marshes to keep pace with SLR through sediment accretion has received considerable attention, the role of microbes in offsetting these gains via decomposition is less understood.We conducted a controlled experiment to determine the structural and functional responses of microbes to SLR, using soil from the low intertidal zone of two New England salt marshes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, USA. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (t-RFLPs) generated from microbial 16S rDNA to evaluate community composition and diversity and focused on changes in respiration with SLR, measured as total respired carbon normalized by percent organic matter, as a surrogate for decomposition rate.We observed a 24% reduction in microbial respiration with a simulated rise in sea level of 40 cm. This functional change was accompanied by a structural shift in microbial community composition among samples from New Hampshire but not Massachusetts, assessed via principal coordinate analysis of t-RFLP data. We also found greater microbial diversity within our New Hampshire samples, suggesting that low diversity may constrain community compositional shifts.Our results suggest that decreased microbial respiration could alleviate the negative effects of SLR on salt marsh surface elevation, at least in the short term, and that the diversity of the soil microbial community may positively influence functional responses such as respiration.

TI  - HIGH-PRECISION MEASUREMENTS OF SEDIMENT ELEVATION IN SHALLOW COASTAL AREAS USING A SEDIMENTATION-EROSION TABLE
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Note
AB  - The use of a sedimentation-erosion table (SET) for the measurement of small changes in sediment surface elevation in intertidal and shallow subtidal areas is described. The SET provides a constant reference plane in space from which the distance to the sediment surface can be measured by lowering pins to the surface. The precision of the method was determined by repeated measurements in coastal marshes, mudflats, and subtidal areas in Louisiana and Georgia. The confidence interval of the SET is about +/- 1.5 mm. The SET is more accurate if pins are lowered manually and the sediment surface is determined visually than if pins are lowered by gravity and the sediment surface is determined by soil resistance.

TI  - The use of lipid markers to define sources of organic matter in sediment and food web of the intertidal salt-marsh-flat ecosystem of Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, France
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh plants and seven surface sediment samples along a transect in the intertidal Bat area of Mont-Saint-Michel Bay were analysed for fatty acids and sterols. The presence of lipid markers of halophytes (long-chain fatty acids, 18 :3 omega 3, and phytosterols) in the surface layers of the sediment confirms the export of organic matter from the salt marsh to the intertidal flat. The spatial distribution of this organic matter over the tidal-flat area was controlled by the tidal currents and the presence of mussel beds, Lipid markers of diatoms (20:5 omega 3 and brassicasterol) and bacteria (18:1 omega 7 and odd, linear and branched, fatty acids) were also found in the surface sediments. Diatoms and benthic bacteria as well as organic matter From the salt marsh were the significant food sources available to the macrozoobenthos on the intertidal Bat. The ingestion of these food types by the dominant species of the macrozoobenthos was confirmed by the presence of their respective lipid markers in the animals, The presence of these markers in animals subjected to a starvation experiment confirmed that these food types are really assimilated. The lipid composition of the starved animals indicated that the species studied were able to accumulate the fatty acid 20:5 omega 3 (considered to be a diatom marker), and that the annelid Nereis diversicolor supported an internal bacterial population.

TI  - Exploiting wild population diversity and somaclonal variation in the salt marsh grass Distichlis spicata (Poaceae) for marsh creation and restoration
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt marsh grass Distichlis spicata was regenerated from tissue culture and propagated in a greenhouse. Selected regenerants, along with selections from six wild populations, were grown for two years in a common garden flood-irrigated thrice weekly with tidal creek water. Selected wild and regenerated plants were also planted in a created salt marsh. Significant differences among regenerant and wild population selections were found in several functionally important salt marsh plant characteristics, including potential detritus production, belowground organic matter production, canopy structure, and decomposition rate. A combination of characteristics not found in the wild populations was evident in a regenerated line that exhibited both a high detritus production potential and a high decomposition rate. The amount of variation that occurred among regenerants from one parental line via somaclonal variation was similar to that which occurred among the wild population selections. Results of this study suggest that tissue culture may provide a means of producing marsh grasses with specific characteristics for directing the functional development of newly created salt marshes.

TI  - Linking vegetation spectral reflectance with ecosystem carbon phenology in a temperate salt marsh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes constitute an important terrestrial-aquatic interface that remains underrepresented in Earth System Models due to constraining biophysical controls and spatially limited land cover. One promising approach to improve representativeness is the application of proximal remote sensing to generate phenological information, yet we lack detailed knowledge on how proximal sensors and indices perform within these ecosystems. We use measurements of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from eddy covariance (EC) and derive ecologically-relevant phenology parameters (i.e., phenoperiods) to use as carbon phenology benchmarks. These benchmarks are compared against vegetation indices and spectral bands derived from spaceborne (i.e., MODIS) or common proximal sensors (i.e., phenocam and spectral reflectance sensors; SRS).Phenocam derived indices, which exclude infrared wavelengths (i.e., vegetation contrast index; VCI and greenness chromatic coordinate; GCC), aligned closely with NEP benchmarks and provided best predictions of carbon sink season length (within 1-6 days of benchmark). Although isolating infrared from vegetation (NIRv) offered improvements, other indices utilizing infrared bands (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index; NDVI and enhanced vegetation index; EVI) primarily underestimated season start dates (5-30 days prior to benchmark) while overestimating season end dates (7-47 days after benchmark). These discrepancies are greatest for indices derived from MODIS and SRS sensors, which have narrower full width half maximum spectral bandwidths and sharper orientation angles. The phenocam (VCI and GCC) provides the most accurate phenology parameters while offering near-infrared (NIR) response which can generate additional information on seasonal changes in canopy structure and function.The distinctive characteristics of the salt marsh environment and vegetation properties including standing dead biomass can introduce interpretation challenges for commonly used vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI). Incorporating information from proximal sensors utilizing only visible wavelengths (VCI, GCC) or isolating the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) offers improvements for studying carbon phenology within salt marshes.

TI  - Trace metal dynamics in the sediments of a constructed and natural urban tidal marsh: The role of iron, sulfide, and organic complexation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two tidal marshes in the New Jersey Meadowlands, one constructed and one natural were characterized to compare their ability to immobilize trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn). Surface and pore waters were sampled four times a year between 2008 and 2010 and sediment cores were collected yearly in the constructed marsh and once in 2010 in the natural marsh. Interactions of trace metals with redox active species such as iron and sulfide as well as with organic matter were investigated. Precipitation with sulfides played a major role in immobilizing certain trace metals, including Cr, Mn, and Pb. At both sites, the presence of sulfide did not preclude the presence of dissolved trace metals in pore-water at concentrations exceeding their metal sulfide solubility product. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling indicated these dissolved metals remained in solution due to an association with heterogeneous dissolved organic carbon. No net trace metal accumulation in the surficial sediments of the constructed marsh was noted between 2007 and 2010. This implied that a dynamic equilibrium of trace metal flux into and out of the sediments was established, rather than a long-term net accumulation of trace metals. In the constructed marsh, little difference was found between the immobilization potential in the area of intermittent flooding (high marsh) and the area of sustained flooding (low marsh). The newly constructed wetland immobilized significantly more Cr, Mn, and Zn than the natural marsh and similar concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Pb. This may be due to increased redox buffering through a larger FeS buffering pool against tidally induced oxygen delivery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term sediment accretion and nutrient deposition in a tidal marsh of the Delaware Bay
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term sediment accretion and nutrient concentrations were investigated in tidal marsh sediments of the Murderkill River, Delaware. Radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137), stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15), organic matter concentrations and nutrient concentrations were measured. Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1). The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites (mostly >= 1% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5% N), decreased to approximately 0.6% N by 1940, and then remained constant to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3 plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level. Surface sediments in all of the cores have more total phosphorus (TP) than below ground. The downstream site closest to the estuary had an abrupt increase in surface TP (i.e., 0-10 cm). Sediment TP increased slightly from 2003 to present time (i.e., from 0.07 to 0.11% P). Sediment accumulation and accretion rates in the Murderkill River marshes are similar to the accretion rates determined by previous studies in the region.

TI  - The Effects of Tidal Export from Salt Marsh Ditches on Estuarine Water Quality and Plankton Communities
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are an important transition zone between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and in their natural state, they often function to cycle or trap terrestrially derived nutrients and organic matter. Many US salt marshes were ditched during the twentieth century, potentially altering their functionality. The goal of this 4-year study was to assess the impact of water from ditches within seven salt marshes on estuarine water quality and plankton communities within four estuaries on Long Island, NY, USA. We found that concentrations of inorganic nutrients (ammonium, phosphate), dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen and carbon (POC, PON, DOC, DON), and total coliform bacteria were significantly enriched in salt marsh ditches compared to the estuaries they discharged into. In addition, concentrations of ammonium and DON became more enriched in ditches as tidal levels decreased, suggesting these constituents were generated in situ. Quantification of nitrogen sources in Flanders Bay, NY, suggested salt marsh ditches could represent a substantial source of N to this estuary during summer months. Experimental incubations demonstrated that water from salt marsh ditches was capable of significantly enhancing the growth of multiple classes of phytoplankton, with large diatoms and dinoflagellates displaying the most dramatic increases in growth. Experiments further demonstrated that salt marsh ditchwater was capable of significantly enhancing pelagic respiration rates, suggesting discharge from ditches could influence estuarine oxygen consumption. In summary, this study demonstrates that tidal draining of salt marsh ditches is capable of degrading multiple aspects of estuarine water quality.

TI  - Stable isotope monitoring of benthic-planktonic coupling using salt marsh fish
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems whose trophic function can be monitored with stable isotopes of abundant fish biosentinel species such as the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus and the Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia. We compared movement patterns and feeding biology of these species in the summers of 1999 and 2000 in the Rowley River salt marsh estuary north of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. A N-15 tracer addition experiment showed that fish of both species were more resident than transient, with mummichogs resident at scales of 1 km or less. Natural abundance stable isotope C, N, and S distributions showed that mummichogs feed more strongly in the benthic food web while silversides feed more in the planktonic food web, with % benthic feeding respectively averaging 58 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 3 % (mean +/- 95 % confidence limit, CL). For both species, isotope results indicated considerable individual specialization in foraging behavior, likely related to use of channel habitat versus use of the marsh. Power analysis showed that measuring 3 composite samples each comprising 10 to 15 individual fish should provide relatively low errors of 0.5 parts per thousand (95 % CL) or less around stable isotope averages. Use of such composite samples in monitoring programs will allow detection of significant temporal and spatial changes in benthic-planktonic coupling for salt marsh ecosystems, as recorded in average fish diets. Analyzing some individual fish also is recommended to obtain more detailed information on fish food sources, feeding specializations, and end-member isotope values used in estimating importance of benthic and planktonic food sources.

TI  - Salt marshes - present functioning and future change
T2  - Mangroves and Salt Marshes
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are no longer viewed as intertidal wastelands of little value to anyone. They are now widely recognised as playing a major role in coastal defence, in wildlife conservation on the coast and as a key source of organic material and nutrients vitally important for a wide range of marine communities. This appreciation of the importance of salt marshes has been brought even more sharply into focus because of the threats posed by predicted rise in sea level as a result of global climatic change. Three decades ago the possibilities of exchanges of organic matter between salt marshes and the sea were already being recognised in certain areas but it is only in the past five years or so that this process has been studied in a wide range of different areas. Detailed studies have been made into the way that salt marsh fluxes change with the development of increasingly mature and, therefore, increasingly complex salt marsh communities. As well as being sources and sinks of mineral nutrients and organic matter, salt marshes can also function as a sink for pollutants that would otherwise be damaging to the environment. Salt marshes also act as a sink for sediment within coastal ecosystems. Through their various functions they can be seen to be acting as dynamic living filters for various ecologically important materials. With increasing threats to the survival of salt marshes as a result of man's activities in the coastal zone being augmented by the threats from predicted sea level rise, a new approach to salt marsh conservation has come to the fore and that is the actual creation of new salt marshes. For this process to be fully effective we have to make full use of our increased understanding of salt marsh structure and function. Following a review of the current state of the art in the field of salt marsh research, an assessment is made of specific future research needs. Despite the greatly increased effort which has been directed to salt marsh research over the past few years we still have to recognise that resources are limited and, therefore, critical evaluations of the various options regarding the direction of our future efforts need to be made.

TI  - Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest,particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act ascarbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or blue carbon systems. Herewe compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collectedin pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within thesame geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The meanestimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes)were 402 78, 830 109, and 723 100 Mg C ha􀀀1, respectively, conservativelyestimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differencebetween C stocks per area (C ha􀀀1) considering each habitat type and between specificestuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasinglevels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potentialloss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 118,635tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of theseresults are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports theprotection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertaintiesof the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

T2  - ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Species composition and ecological preferences of the most important periphytic diatom taxa were studied in lentic ecosystems in the salt marshes of Emporda wetlands (NE Spain). Correspondence analysis with the diatom communities suggested that water confinement/flooding gradient and productivity of the system were the principal factors affecting diatom distribution in the salt marshes of Empord wetlands. Hierarchical analysis clusters allowed 5 diatom assemblages be distinguished, each one characteristic of different degrees of confinement and productivity. Bacillaria paradoxa appeared as the most characteristic species in low confinement and high productivity conditions. Navicula perminuta and N. salinarum were representative of flooding and low productivity conditions. During maximum confinement and low productivity situations Cocconeis placentula dominated the diatom community. When maximum confinement was attained in the waterbodies with higher productivity, this dominance was shared with Nitzschia archibaldii. The 39 species considered proved to be tolerant to salinity and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter) variability. This seems to be a prerequisite for survival in salt marshes where the very dynamic nature of the system results in a large variability of the physical and chemical water composition.

TI  - Observations on Shallow Subsurface Hydrology at Bay of Fundy Macrotidal Salt Marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrology is a major driver of salt marsh functions and the ecological services they support. Sediment saturation, and thus subsurface hydrology, affects salt marsh vegetation productivity, zonation, and survival. Subsurface hydrology influences rates of subsidence; concentrations of nutrients, organic matter, and oxygen; fluxes of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide; and sediment toxicity. Therefore, baseline knowledge of subsurface hydrology is crucial in predicting and managing change in salt marshes. Previous research on subsurface hydrology has mostly been conducted in organogenic, microtidal marshes that do not provide suitable models for minerogenic, macrotidal marshes such as those in the Bay of Fundy. In this study, we examine drivers of subsurface hydrology and compare two pairs of reference and recovering marshes with tidal amplitudes of 6 to 12 m. Measurements in PVC wells at various depths reveal differences between seasons, during the neap-spring tidal cycle, and between channels of differing depths. We suggest that soil characteristics, duration between inundation events, marsh geomorphology, and precipitation all are more important drivers of subsurface hydrology in Bay of Fundy marshes than tidal height. Our observations also indicate that subsurface hydrology generally can be restored to previously drained marshes. Bay of Fundy marshes are likely to be more ecologically resistant to rising sea level because changes in tidal heights will have a minimal effect on subsurface hydrology. Thus, restoration of the many Bay of Fundy marshes previously drained for agriculture is likely to be successful in offsetting losses expected in more vulnerable, microtidal marshes.

TI  - Linking Bacterial Communities Associated with the Environment and the Ecosystem Engineer Orchestia gammarellus at Contrasting Salt Marsh Elevations
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The digestive tract of animals harbors microbiota important for the host's fitness and performance. The interaction between digestive tract bacteria and soil animal hosts is still poorly explored despite the importance of soil fauna for ecosystem processes. In this study, we investigated the interactions between the bacterial communities from the digestive tract of the litter-feeding, semi-terrestrial crustacean Orchestia gammarellus and those obtained from the environment; these organisms thrive in, i.e., soil and plant litter from salt marshes. We hypothesized that elevation is an important driver of soil and litter bacterial communities, which indirectly (via ingested soil and litter bacteria) influences the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of O. gammarellus. Indeed, our results revealed that elevation modulated soil and litter bacterial community composition along with soil organic matter content and the C:N ratio. Soil and plant litter differed in alpha diversity indexes (richness and diversity), and in the case of plant litter, both indexes increased with elevation. In contrast, elevation did not affect the composition of bacterial communities associated with O. gammarellus' digestive tract, suggesting selection by the host, despite the fact that a large component of the bacterial community was also detected in external sources. Importantly, Ca. Bacilloplasma and Vibrio were highly prevalent and abundant in the host. The taxonomic comparison of Ca. Bacilloplasma amplicon sequence variants across the host at different elevations suggested a phylogenetic divergence due to host habitat (i.e., marine or semi-terrestrial), thus supporting their potential functional role in the animal physiology. Our study sheds light on the influence of the environment on soil animal-bacteria interactions and provides insights into the resilience of the O. gammarellus-associated bacteria to increased flooding frequency.

TI  - Effects of vegetation on root-associated microbial communities: A comparison of disturbed versus undisturbed estuarine sediments
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - While it has been demonstrated that microbial communities are influenced by plant species composition in upland systems, less is known about how estuarine vegetation may influence the structure and functional capabilities of sediment microbial communities. In this study, we adapted terrestrial catabolic response profile (CRP) methods for use under brackish anaerobic conditions. CRI's were employed to determine whether salt marsh vegetation had an effect on sediment microbial community function. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were utilized as a descriptor of microbial community structure. Samples were obtained from monospecific Spartina alterniffora and Phragmites australis plots located in disturbed and undisturbed estuarine salt marsh systems. In response to the addition of a range of 30 organic substrates we observed significant CO2 production in vegetated versus non-vegetated sediments from the undisturbed site. Vegetated sediments from the undisturbed system produced greater amounts of both CO2 and CH4, while sediments from the disturbed site consumed CO2 except in response to carboxylic acid substrates. In response to nitrogen-containing (amino acid) substrates undisturbed Phragmites sediments produced the highest amount of CO2 seen in any sample. Few differences in CRPs or PLFAs were seen in sediments from the disturbed site. The production of CO2 was significantly correlated with microbial community structure as described by PLFA profiles. This study is the first to use CRPs to describe estuarine sediment microbial community functional ability, and to link this ability with community PLFA composition. Our results suggest that individual plant species have a less pronounced effect than has been observed in upland soils in structuring salt marsh sediment microbial communities. Under anthropogenically disturbed conditions the effects of the macrophyte root zone on the sediment microbial communities may be overwhelmed, resulting in different ecosystem level functional abilities.

TI  - Modeling photosynthesis of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using Bayesian inference
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on photosynthesis of coastal salt marsh plants in Mississippi, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model based on field measurements collected from July 2010 to November 2011. We sampled three locations in Davis Bayou, Mississippi (30.375 degrees N, 88.790 degrees W) representative of a range of oil spill impacts. Measured photosynthesis was negative (respiration only) at the heavily oiled location in July 2010 only, and rates started to increase by August 2010. Photosynthesis at the medium oiling location was lower than at the control location in July 2010 and it continued to decrease in September 2010. During winter 2010-2011, the contrast between the control and the two impacted locations was not as obvious as in the growing season of 2010. Photosynthesis increased through spring 2011 at the three locations and decreased starting with October at the control location and a month earlier (September) at the impacted locations.Using the field data, we developed an HB model. The model simulations agreed well with the measured photosynthesis, capturing most of the variability of the measured data. On the basis of the posteriors of the parameters, we found that air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation positively influenced photosynthesis whereas the leaf stress level negatively affected photosynthesis. The photosynthesis rates at the heavily impacted location had recovered to the status of the control location about 140 days after the initial impact, while the impact at the medium impact location was never severe enough to make photosynthesis significantly lower than that at the control location over the study period. The uncertainty in modeling photosynthesis rates mainly came from the individual and micro-site scales, and to a lesser extent from the leaf scale.

TI  - Grazer deterrence and fungal inhibition by the invasive marsh grass Phragmites australis and the native sedge Bolboschoenus robustus in a mesohaline marsh
T2  - CHEMOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marsh habitats provide many important functions to coastal areas and are a valuable economic resource. Polyhaline marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora can experience top-down control by the snail Littoraria irrorata who primarily impact Spartina through facilitating fungal growth on wounds they create. This grazing pressure may have selected for the production of chemical defenses in Spartina and other polyhaline marsh plants that deter snail feeding and fungal growth. Both Spartina and Littoraria can co-occur in mesohaline marshes that line the Chesapeake Bay, but little is known about interactions between this snail and plants in this habitat. Plant diversity, identity, and consumer abundance can differ between poly- and mesohaline marshes, and this may yield different patterns in the two marsh types. We investigated whether two abundant plants in a Chesapeake Bay mesohaline marsh of salinity similar to 13ppt deterred snail feeding and inhibited fungal growth. Through a bioassay-guided fractionation approach, we assessed palatability to snails and growth of the fungus Phaeosphaeria spartinae in response to chemical components in the invasive marsh grass Phragmites australis and the native sedge Bolboschoenus robustus. Both plants possessed chemicals that significantly deterred snail feeding compared to Spartina chemicals. In addition, both plants inhibited fungal growth, mediated by multiple metabolites. Snail density in this marsh was low (25 snails m(-2)), but may be enough to select for defenses in Bolboschoenus, or deterrent and inhibitory metabolites may be selected for by other consumers or factors. Chemical defenses in invasive Phragmites may contribute to its success in the Chesapeake Bay.

TI  - Transport of dissolved inorganic carbon from a tidal freshwater marsh to the York River estuary
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cycling of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the role of tidal marshes in estuarine DIC dynamics were studied in a Virginia tidal freshwater marsh and adjacent estuary. DIC was measured over diurnal cycles in different seasons in a marsh tidal creek and at the junction of the creek with the adjacent Pamunkey River. In the creek, DIC concentrations around high tide were controlled by the same processes affecting whole-estuary DIC gradients. Near low tide, DIC concentrations were 1.5-5-fold enriched relative to high tide concentrations, indicating an input of DIC from the marsh. Similar patterns (although dampened in magnitude) were observed at the creek mouth and indicated that DIC was exported from the marsh. Marsh pore-water DIC concentrations were up to 5 mmol L-1 greater than those in the creek and suggested a significant input of sediment pore water to the creek. A model of tidal marsh DIC export showed that, on a seasonal basis, DIC export rates were influenced by water temperature. The composition of exported DIC averaged 19% dissolved CO2 and 81% HCO3- and CO32-. Although CO2 can be lost to the atmosphere during transit through the estuary DIC in the form of carbonate alkalinity is subject to export from the estuary to the coastal ocean. When extrapolated to an estuarywide scale, the export of marsh-derived DIC to the York River estuary explained a significant portion (47 +/- 23%) of excess DIC production (i.e., DIC in excess of that expected from conservative mixing between seawater and freshwater and equilibrium with the atmosphere) in this system. Therefore, CO2 supersaturation, by itself, does not indicate that an estuary is net heterotrophic.

TI  - Ecosystem gas exchange across a created salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes created on dredge spoil were compared to natural marshes to evaluate the capacity of created marshes to perform carbon cycle functions. Several carbon cycle attributes were measured in eight created Spartina alterniflora Loisel salt marshes that ranged from one to 28 years, each paired with a nearby mature natural reference marsh. The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years. There was some evidence that ecosystem gas exchange in created marshes developed slightly faster than aboveground biomass production. Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes. However, carbon mineralization rates per gram soil were relatively low in the created marshes due to lower soil organic matter content. With proper construction, we suggest most major carbon fluxes can be established in created salt marshes in less than five years.

TI  - Geochemical evidence for cryptic sulfur cycling in salt marsh sediments
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryptic sulfur cycling is an enigmatic process in which sulfate is reduced to some lower-valence state sulfur species and subsequently quantitatively reoxidized; the rate and microbial energetics of this process and how prevalent it may be in the environment remain controversial. Here we investigate sulfur cycling in salt marsh sediments from Norfolk, England where we observe high ferrous iron concentrations with no depletion of sulfate or change in the sulfur isotope ratio of that sulfate, but a 5%(0) increase in the oxygen isotope ratio in sulfate, indicating that sulfate has been through a reductive cycle replacing its oxygen atoms. This cryptic sulfur cycle was replicated in laboratory incubations using O-18-enriched water, demonstrating that the field results do not solely result from mixing processes in the natural environment. Numerical modeling of the laboratory incubations scaled to represent the salt marsh sediments suggests that the uptake rate of sulfate during this cryptic sulfur cycling is similar to the uptake rate of sulfate during the fastest microbial sulfate reduction that has been measured in the natural environment. The difference is that during cryptic sulfur cycling, all of the sulfur is subsequently reoxidized to sulfate. We discuss mechanisms for this pathway of sulfur cycling including the possible link to the subsurface iron cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of Increasing Tidewater Inundation on Porewater Geochemistries and CO2 and CH4 Effluxes in the Tidal Freshwater Marshes of the Minjiang River Estuary, Southeast China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - While the effect of increasing tidewater inundation caused by sea-level rise on carbon cycling had been well studied in saltmarshes, little is known about the effect of increasing tidewater inundation on CO2 and CH4 effluxes in the tidal freshwater marsh soils. Herein, the effects of tide inundation on porewater geochemistries (NH4+, NO3-, DOC, dissolved CH4, and DIC) and CH4 and CO2 effluxes were examined in the soils of tidal freshwater marshes in the Minjiang River Estuary, East China Sea. By applying "mesocosm" and a simulated tide pool, the tide inundation height increased by 15 cm and 30 cm over the control (CK). The CO2 effluxes decreased by 28.53% and 36.56%, and the dissolved CH4 concentrations increased by 47.83% and 73.91%, in treatments (CK + 15 cm) and (CK + 30 cm), respectively. The CH4 effluxes did not change significantly in the treatment (CK + 15 cm), but increased by 29.27% in treatment (CK + 30 cm). The increasing tidewater inundation had no significant impact on DOC concentrations, but increased NH4+ concentrations and decreased DIC and NO3- concentrations. Increasing tide inundation also reduced the temperature sensitivity of CH4 and CO2 effluxes. The study highlighted that the sea level rise-induced increase in tidewater inundation would decrease the annual global warming potential of tidal freshwater wetlands by 28% and 35% in the next 50 and 100 years, respectively.

TI  - Marsh benthic Foraminifera response to estuarine hydrological balance driven by climate variability over the last 2000 yr (Minho estuary, NW Portugal)
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-resolution study of a marsh sedimentary sequence from the Minho estuary provides a new palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from NW Iberian based on geological proxies supported by historical and instrumental climatic records. A low-salinity tidal flat, dominated by Trochamminita salsa, Haplophragmoides spp. and Cribrostomoides spp., prevailed from AD 140-1360 (Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages, Medieval Climatic Anomaly). This sheltered environment was affected by high hydrodynamic episodes, marked by the increase in silt/clay ratio, decrease of organic matter, and poor and weakly preserved foraminiferal assemblages, suggesting enhanced river runoff. The establishment of low marsh began at AD 1380. This low-salinity environment, marked by colder and wet conditions, persisted from AD 1410-1770 (Little Ice Age), when foraminiferal density increased significantly. Haplophragmoides manilaensis and Trochamminita salsa mark the transition from low to high marsh at AD 1730. Since AD 1780 the abundances of salt marsh species (Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata) increased, accompanied by a decrease in foraminiferal density, reflecting climate instability, when droughts alternate with severe floods. SW Europe marsh foraminifera respond to the hydrological balance, controlled by climatic variability modes (e.g., NAO) and solar activity, thus contributing to the understanding of NE Atlantic climate dynamics.

TI  - Selenium volatilization from tundra soils in maritime Antarctica
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime Antarctica harbors a large number of penguins and seals that provide considerable input of selenium (Se) originating as guano into terrestrial ecosystems. Subsequent Se emissions via biomethylation and volatilization from these sources of Se have not been studied. Here, penguin colony soils (PCS) and adjacent tundra marsh soils (TMS), seal colony soils (SCS) and adjacent tundra soils (STS), and normal upland tundra soils (NTS) were collected in maritime Antarctica. For the first time, Se volatilization and speciation were investigated in these soils through incubation experiments using chemo-trapping method. The Se contents in PCS, SCS, STS and TMS were highly enriched compared with NTS, with organic matter-bound Se accounting for 70%-80%. Laboratory incubations yielded the greatest Se volatilization rates (VRSe) in PCS (0.20 +/- 0.01 mu g kg(-degrees 1) d(-1)), followed by SCS (0.14 +/- 0.01 mu g kg(-1) d(-1)) at low temperature (4 C). Soil frozen-thawing induced 1-4 fold increase in VRSe, and the VRSe continuously increased until the soils fully thawed. The VRSe showed a significant positive correlation (R-2 = 0.96, p < 0.01) with soil temperature. Methylated Se species were dominated by dimethylselenide (DMSe) in PCS and dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) in SCS. Our results imply that the combination of climate warming, frozen-thawing processes, and high-Se inputs from sea animals will significantly increase tundra soil Se volatilization in maritime Antarctica. High VRSe from penguin colony soils, and significantly elevated Se levels in the mosses close to penguin colony, suggest that volatilization of Se from penguin colony soils play an important role in the mobilization and regional biogeochemical cycling of Se in maritime Antarctica.

TI  - Tidal marsh plant responses to elevated CO2, nitrogen fertilization, and sea level rise
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) addition directly affect plant productivity and the mechanisms that allow tidal marshes to maintain a constant elevation relative to sea level, but it remains unknown how these global change drivers modify marsh plant response to sea level rise. Here we manipulated factorial combinations of CO2 concentration (two levels), N availability (two levels) and relative sea level (six levels) using in situ mesocosms containing a tidal marsh community composed of a sedge, Schoenoplectus americanus, and a grass, Spartina patens. Our objective is to determine, if elevated CO2 and N alter the growth and persistence of these plants in coastal ecosystems facing rising sea levels. After two growing seasons, we found that N addition enhanced plant growth particularly at sea levels where plants were most stressed by flooding (114% stimulation in the+10cm treatment), and N effects were generally larger in combination with elevated CO2 (288% stimulation). N fertilization shifted the optimal productivity of S. patens to a higher sea level, but did not confer S. patens an enhanced ability to tolerate sea level rise. S. americanus responded strongly to N only in the higher sea level treatments that excluded S. patens. Interestingly, addition of N, which has been suggested to accelerate marsh loss, may afford some marsh plants, such as the widespread sedge, S. americanus, the enhanced ability to tolerate inundation. However, if chronic N pollution reduces the availability of propagules of S. americanus or other flood-tolerant species on the landscape scale, this shift in species dominance could render tidal marshes more susceptible to marsh collapse.

TI  - The responses of indigenous oil-degrading bacteria to oil exposure in Phragmites australis-dominated marsh soil: a mesocosm study
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined impacts of Macondo MC252 oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on oil-degrading bacteria in fresh and oligohaline marshes dominated by the common reed Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and correlated microbial changes to soil variables. We hypothesized that indigenous oil-degrading bacteria and soil characteristics in the marshes effectively respond to Macondo oil. We tested this hypothesis with a greenhouse mesocosm study. Weathered and emulsified Macondo oil was applied to P. australis sods at different rates (0, 4, 8, 12, and 16Lm(-2)). Populations of oil degrading bacteria containing alkane monooxygenase and PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase alpha subunit (PAH-RHD) genes, the expression of these genes, soil respiration rate, residual total petroleum hydrocarbon, redox potential (Eh), as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its aromaticity index of SUVA(254) were measured in soils 2months after oil addition. Oil exposure generally increased oil-degrading bacterial populations, in particular Gram-positive (GP) PAH-degraders, soil respiration rate, DOC concentration, and aromaticity of DOC, but decreased Eh values. GP PAH-RHD genes accounted for approximately 98% of total detected genes, and expression of these genes increased by a factor of 3 to 5 at various oil dosages. Both abundance and expression of GP PAH-RHD genes significantly correlated to SUVA(254) (P<0.05). The study revealed that indigenous oil-degrading bacteria effectively responded to weathered Macondo oil in the P. australis marsh soil wherein GP bacteria with PAH-RHD genes played a major role in biodegradation of PAH-enriched petroleum hydrocarbons.

We measured the uptake of tritiated leucine, as a proxy for bacterial production, in both low and high marsh habitats in four salt marshes, two of which were enriched with nutrients. We hypothesized that adding nitrogen in these detritus-rich systems would directly stimulate bacterial decomposition of marsh peat. Contrary to our expectations, we found no response to added nutrients in high marsh habitats, where there is a significant supply of organic matter from marsh vegetation. Bacterial production did increase in the low marsh habitats, where fertilization increased the standing stock of benthic chlorophyll. Fertilization did not directly increase bacterial production by providing added nutrients that could be used to decompose organic matter derived from nutrient-poor marsh grasses. Rather, bacterial productivity was indirectly stimulated by the concomitant increase in labile benthic microalgae in low marsh habitats. Decomposition of salt marshes may therefore have a greater resilience to the threat of chronic eutrophication than has been previously recognized.

TI  - Impacts of plant invasions can be reversed through restoration: a regional meta-analysis of faunal communities
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the effects of invasive Phragmites australis on estuarine faunal communities using meta-analysis to compare invaded to uninvaded marshes and then evaluated whether ecological restoration could reverse those effects. Relative to uninvaded marshes, the quantity and condition of fauna in invaded marshes was significantly poorer. We detected negative impacts to fauna residing in the mid-Atlantic but not in New England and to fauna utilizing the marsh surface but not to those inhabiting tidal creeks. By taxonomic group, we found that the invasion negatively affected nekton but not invertebrates. Both adult and sub-adult nekton were adversely affected, although the magnitude of the effect on the sub-adults was four times greater than that for adults. Our results indicate that negative effects on fauna within the mid-Atlantic region largely drove the overall results. When restored marshes were compared to uninvaded marshes there were no significant differences across all metrics assessed, suggesting that the negative impacts of the invasion were reversed. A separate qualitative review of trophic data indicated that benthic microalgae and dominant vascular plants are important primary producers at the base of the food web in uninvaded, invaded, and restored salt marshes but the overall quantity and importance of microalgae to diet decreased in highly invaded systems due to decreased light, potentially reducing energy availability. Our analyses revealed that while estuarine communities are adversely affected by P. australis, impacts vary by region, habitat, taxonomic group, and life history stage and that restoration can reverse long-term effects over relatively short time scales.

TI  - Bromide Tolerance in Salicornia brachiata Roxb, an Obligate Halophyte
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal marshy lands, halogen bromide concentration is reported to be generally higher than in the inland soils where, annual halophytic species naturally grow. The effect of bromide on plant responses is relatively less known. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of sodium bromide (NaBr) on growth, photosynthetic pigments, tissue ions content and changes in enzymes activity in Salicornia brachiata, a salt marsh halophyte. Presence of NaBr in the root medium induced 200 percent increase in fresh mass and 30% increase in dry mass, compared to untreated control. Relative water content also increased significantly with NaBr treatment. Increase in fresh and dry mass was not associated with high photosynthetic efficiency as evidenced by decrease in photosynthetic pigments accumulation. However, inorganic ion analysis revealed that S. brachiata accumulated Na+ as a primary osmotica. The concentration of Na+ in NaBr treated plants was similar to 4 fold higher than that measured in untreated controls and this was associated with significant reduction in K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ contents. Bromide content also increased significantly and accounted for 20 to 50 percent of dry weight. In addition, significant differences in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT) and ATPase were observed in bromide treated plants. For the first time bromide tolerance in coastal halophyte was reported and the results suggest that bromide was not toxic to S. brachiata for growth and metabolism even at 600 mM. concentration and suggest that the species can be used in phytoremediation of bromide contaminated soils.

M3  - Article
AB  - 101 samples of wheat grain and soils were taken at locations with marsh soils in the valley of the Elbe river and in areas with waste water irrigation. The contents of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were estimated in grain and in soils after extraction by CaCl2/DTPA (CAD), CaCl2, and NH4NO3 respectively. Included in the evaluation were the contents obtained by extraction with aqua regia, percentage of clay, fine silt, organic matter, and pH values.The samples comprised acid and slightly alkaline, sandy and loamy soils. The heavy metal contents extracted by aqua regia were normal or slightly enriched; critical values according to the decree of waste water sludge were not reached.Plant available Cu was detectable only by means of the CAD method, and the Zn contents of soils extracted by CAD were closest correlated with plant Zn.The NH4NO3 method resulted in the highest correlation between the Ni contents of soils and plants. Pb was only dectable by means of CAD, but the values can not be regarded as plant available.Among the methods applied, CaCl2 is the best to predict contamination of wheat with Cd. The double of the critical value of the Federal Health Agency for wheat, 0.2 mg/kg, is reached at a soil content of 0.2 mg/kg, independent from the clay content and the pH value of the soil.The CAD method is suitable for a preliminary survey of heavy metal contents of soils. However, to provide evidence of soil contamination it appears necessary to apply the method most suitable for the element in question or plant analyses.

TI  - Biomass partitioning in an endemic southern African salt marsh species Salicornia tegetaria (Chenopodiaceae)
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The below ground biomass of salt marsh species accounts for more than half of the total plant biomass in salt marsh systems, yet no biomass data exist for salt marsh species in South Africa. The aims of the current study were to compare the biomass allocation of Salicornia tegetaria in six estuaries and relate findings to their environmental conditions. The current study measured the physico-chemical variables of the sediment (moisture content, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, pH) and pore water (temperature, salinity, pH, depth) at Olifants, Berg, Langebaan, Heuningnes, Nahoon and Kwelerha estuaries. Above and below ground biomass and stem height measurements were also collected. The below ground biomass (1.51 +/- 0.24 kg m(-2)) and root/shoot ratio (1.36 +/- 0.17) was the lowest at Heuningnes Estuary with no significant difference at the remaining estuaries, suggesting that factors, such as geomorphology and sedimentological processes, could have a stronger effect on the biomass allocation in this species. Important drivers of biomass allocation were sediment pH, redox potential and pore water depth. The current study provides baseline information for S. tegetaria, an endemic salt marsh species, for which there is a paucity of data. This species plays a major role in the ecology of the lower intertidal zone, which will be vulnerable to sea-level rise.

TI  - Ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectral evidence of natural organic matter (NOM) changes along an estuarine salinity gradient
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A transect of the St Marys River estuary from above the point of maximum salt wedge penetration to coastal salinities was conducted in July 1999. None of the parameters examined-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content, UV light absorbance at 254 run, and Total Luminescence spectra-follow the rule of conservative mixing. The characteristics of the different molecular size fractions of the St Marys River natural organic matter (NOM), as well as the results of a laboratory mixing experiment, provided evidence that loss of larger molecular size compounds from riverine NOM may occur by coagulation at salinities up to 10. An apparent gain of carbon in the lower estuary was attributed to exports from abundant coastal marshes in this area.The Total Luminescence spectra of the riverine NOM can be described by two peaks, centered respectively around 340/445 nm, and 230/430 nm Excitation/Emission Wavelength Pair (EEWP), which are characteristic of humic materials of aquatic origin. The samples from the high salinity stations exhibit peaks at lower emission wavelength EEWP 320/424 rim, which can be considered as marine humic-like material. The presence of amino acid-tryptophan like peaks were observed, with EEWP 300/350 nm in some of the high salinity samples. This peak was of high relative fluorescence intensity. It is hypothesized that the intense biological activity of the salt marsh and near coastal area is responsible for the carbon addition as well as the appearance of the highly fluorescence amino acid-protein like material.

TI  - Elevated CO2 and high salinity enhance the abundance of sulfate reducers in a salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are anticipated to be exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 and high salinity due to sea-level rise in the future. This study aims to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and high salinity on microbial communities using intact cores collected from a salt marsh in North Wales, UK. The cores were exposed to two levels of CO2 (ambient vs. ambient + 200 ppm) and two levels of salinity (control vs. control + 10 ppt) over a growing season in the Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility. We focused on the abundances of bacteria, sulfate reducers (SRB), methanogens and denitrifiers as they play a central role in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the activities of extracellular enzymes were determined to assess the effects on microbial activity, followed by Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to elucidate possible mechanism for the changes we observed. Elevated CO2 significantly increased DOC in pore water for the control salinity treatment during a vigorous growing season (i.e., May - Aug) but not the high salinity treatment. Microbial diversity presented by Shannon's diversity derived from T-RFLP analysis showed no significant changes except for nirS genes, suggesting potential influence of elevated CO2 on denitrification. Microbial abundances changed substantially for certain functional groups; For example, the abundance of SRB increased both by elevated CO2 and high salinity. In contrast, total bacterial abundance declined under the treatment of high salinity. SEM suggests that elevated CO2 increases DOC in pore-water, which increased sulfate reducers. Salinity plays an additional role in this process to selectively increasing SRB without affecting methanogens. Overall, the results of this study suggest that SRB will play a key role in organic matter decomposition in salt marshes as atmospheric CO2 and salinity increase. This is most likely to be mediated by changes in the quantity and the quality of organic carbon derived from salt marsh vegetation.

TI  - Short-term effect of simulated salt marsh restoration by sand-amendment on sediment bacterial communities
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in  Spartina alterniflora -vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing  Zetaproteobacteria  increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for  S .  alterniflora . While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of  S .  alterniflora  are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Release of dissolved organic matter during oxic and anoxic decomposition of salt marsh cordgrass
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as the light absorbing fraction of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM), plays a number of important roles in the global and local biogeochernical cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in controlling the optical properties of estuarine and coastal waters. Intertidal areas such as salt marshes can contribute significant amounts of the CDOM that is exported to the ocean, but the processes controlling this CDOM source are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the production of DOM and CDOM from the decomposition of two salt marsh cordgrasses, Spartina patens, a C-4 grass, and Typha latifiblia, a C-3 grass, in well-controlled laboratory experiments. During the seven-week incubation period of the salt marsh grasses in oxic and anoxic seawater, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, dissolved nitrogen (DN) concentrations, stable carbon isotopic composition of DOC (DOC-delta(13) C), and CDOM fluorescence demonstrate a significant contribution of DOC and CDOM to estuarine waters from salt marsh plants, such as Spartina and Typha species. In the natural environment, however, the release processes of CDOM from different cordgrass species could be controlled largely by the in situ oxic and anoxic conditions present during degradation which affects both the production and decomposition of DOC and CDOM, as well as the optical properties of CDOM in estuarine and coastal waters.

TI  - Food web analysis of southern California coastal wetlands using multiple stable isotopes
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes were used to characterize the food webs (i.e., sources of carbon and trophic status of consumers) in Tijuana Estuary and San Dieguito Lagoon. Producer groups were most clearly differentiated by carbon, then by sulfur, and least clearly by nitrogen isotope measurements. Consumer N-15 isotopic enrichment suggested that there are four trophic levels in the Tijuana Estuary food web and three in San Dieguito Lagoon. A significant difference in multiple isotope ratio distributions of fishes between wetlands suggested that the food web of San Dieguito Lagoon is less complex than that of Tijuana Estuary. Associations among sources and consumers indicated that inputs from intertidal macroalgae, marsh microalgae, and Spartina foliosa provide the organic matter that supports invertebrates, fishes, and the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes). These three producers occupy tidal channels, low salt marsh, and mid salt marsh habitats. The only consumer sampled that appears dependent upon primary productivity from high salt marsh habitat is the sera (Porzana carolina). Two- and three-source mixing models identified Spartina as the major organic matter source for fishes, and macroalgae for invertebrates and the light-footed clapper rail in Tijuana Estuary. In San Dieguito Lagoon, a system lacking Spartina, inputs of macroalgae and microalgae support fishes. Salicornia virginica, S. subterminalis, Monanthochloe littoralis, sewage-derived organic matter, and suspended particulate organic matter were deductively excluded as dominant, direct influences on the food web. The demonstration of a salt marsh-channel linkage in these systems affirms that these habitats should be managed as a single ecosystem and that the restoration of intertidal marshes for endangered birds and other biota is compatible with enhancement of coastal fish populations; heretofore, these have been considered to be competing objectives.

TI  - The role of salt marshes in the Mira estuary (Portugal)
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mira estuary is a narrow entrenched pristine estuary of the Ria type, about 30 km long. It comprises an area of 285 ha of salt marsh, of which 250 ha have been proposed for reclamation for aquaculture. Dredging, village and recreation development menace the yet undisturbed estuarine ecosystem. To assess the biological importance of this wetland, a multidisciplinary study was conducted in a part of the salt marsh, considered as being representative of the whole area. Halophytic vegetation covering 75% of the total salt marsh site is dominated by Spartina maritima (28% of total vegetation area). Total primary production attains 63,766 kg/yr (dw). A net export of 1541 kg/yr of COM to the relatively oligotrophic adjacent waters was also found. Insects and birds are described for the first time in the saltmarsh. Macrobenthic communities are dominated by Hediste diversicolor, Nepthys caeca and Scrobicularia plana. The fiddler crab Uca tangeri attains here its north distribution limit. The mud flats and creeks associated with the salt marsh act as a nursery for 40.8% of the fish species present. The food web is dominated by detritivorous species like the grey mullets. The results obtained in this study support the need for an effective conservation of this area.

TI  - Carbohydrates, carbon and nitrogen in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh as influenced by inundation frequency
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marshes on the southern North Sea coast store large amounts of organic matter (OM). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates. This study shows that monosaccharides are useful biomarkers to explore the origin of OM in coastal soils. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Specifically radiolabeled [C-14-lignin] lignocellulose and uniformly [U-C-14] lignocellulose from the salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora were incubated with the ascomycete Phaeosphaeria spartinicola. This fungus is the predominant one found on decaying standing dead S. alterniflora leaves in the salt marsh ecosystem. After 45 days of incubation at 20-degrees-C, 3.3% of the lignin moiety was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 and 2.7% solubilized to (DOC)-C-14. Mineralization of the polysaccharides was seven times faster than that of the lignin.  About 22% of the radioactivity was evolved as (CO2)-C-14 but merely 4% was solubilized to (DOC)-C-14 within the incubation time. Experiments monitoring the ergosterol content of the mycelium incubated with date the carbon conversion efficiency of the fungus as well as the influence of the cinnamyl phenols p-coumaric and ferulic acid on lignocellulose degradation. After 21 days of incubation, P. spartinicola showed a growth yield of 0.45 and 0.38 with and without the additional cinnamyl phenols, respectively. Grown on unextracted S. alterniflora, the fungus caused a loss of organic plant material of about 50% with a corresponding growth yield of 0.38 during the incubation period. Investigation of cupric oxide oxidation products of sound and degraded lignocellulose revealed a preferential utilization of the syringyl and cinnamyl phenols compared with vanillyl phenols.

AB  - Reduced S groups in soil organic matter (OM) play an important rule in the complexation of heavy metals. These complexation reactions are often studied using the humic acid component of OM, The objective of our study was to determine the effect of pH on humic acid yield and the effect of pH and exposure to O-2 on the oxidation of reduced organic S, Humic acid was extracted at pH levels between 11.5 and 13.0 from a soil collected from a salt marsh, Also, aqueous samples of humic acid at different pH levels were aspirated with CO,free air for 4 or 44 h, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was used to determine changes in S oxidation states for the various treatments. With increasing pH, the yield of humic acid increased from 1.3 to 4.6 g humic acid kg(-1) soil, and the total S in these samples was 24 +/- 1 g kg(-1) humic acid, Linear-combination fitting of XANES spectra showed that all of these humic acid samples contained approximate to 70% (mol/mol) reduced S (modeled as benzyl disulfide) and 30% (mol/mol) oxidized S (modeled as sulfonate and ester sulfate). For humic acid exposed to aeration for 4 h at pH levels between 11.5 and 13.0, reduced organic S was oxidized only at pH 13.0 (15% [mol/mol] of total S), Samples exposed to aeration for 44 h between pH 3.5 and 12.4 showed no detectable change in reduced organic S.

M3  - Article
AB  - One and a half years after the worst oil spill in U.S. history, we present the first quantitative assessment on the ecological impact of the spill on the salt marsh habitats along the southeastern Louisiana (LA) coast. This research combined satellite and ground data to quantify the impact of the oil and dispersant on the salt marshes in terms of their photosynthetic capacity and physiological status over a large spatial scale. Two of the most important marsh biophysical characteristics, including distribution of canopy chlorophyll content and above ground green biomass, were monitored across the southeastern LA coast during the salt marsh growing season (May-October) of 2009 (pre-spill) and 2010 (post-spill) in order to compare and isolate the spill impacted areas. The initial assessment showed that there was a significant post-spill increase in areas with reduced biomass and canopy chlorophyll (>400 km(2)) during the 2010 growing season compared to 50-65 km(2) during the 2009 growing season. Phenological analysis of the post oil-spill data revealed a significant decrease in the magnitude of biomass and canopy chlorophyll during the peak of the 2010 growing season. June was consistently found to be the worst month in terms of salt marsh health across LA over the 2010 phenological cycle followed by the initial signs of recovery along the fringing marsh areas proximal to the shoreline that were first impacted by oil. Interior marsh patches exhibited persistent signs of stress towards the end of the growing season. Extensive reduction in photosynthetic activity was observed during the peak of the growing season, particularly in Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish. The products generated through this study successfully delineate the critical hotspots of marsh stress so that prioritization of areas needing immediate restoration can be performed.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil labile carbon fractions of freshwater marsh soil in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past 50 years, the amount of agricultural fertilizer used in Northern China increased from about 7.5 kg ha(-1) in the 1950s to approximately 348 kg ha(-1) in the 1990s. Given that little is known about the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil labile carbon fraction in Northern China, this paper evaluated such effects in terms of microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon in the Sanjiang Plain located in Northeast China. Soils with different cultivation time and undisturbed marsh with Deyeuxia angustifolia were selected to study the effects of nitrogen fertilization on the soil labile organic fractions microbial C (biomass C, microbial quotient, and basal respiration) and to estimate the contributions of nitrogen input on the dynamics of soil labile carbon. Continuous nitrogen application decreased total organic and dissolved organic carbon concentrations significantly, leading to the lack of carbon source for microbes. Therefore, continuous nitrogen fertilizer application induced negative effects on measured soil microbiological properties. However, a moderate nitrogen application rate (60 kg N ha(-1)) stimulated soil microbial activity in the short term (about 2 months), whereas a high nitrogen application rate (150 kg N ha(-1)) inhibited measured soil microbiological properties in the same period.

TI  - Detecting Multiple States of Trophic Connectivity Between Mangroves and Salt Marshes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The productivity gradient between adjacent habitats can fluctuate over time due to seasonal cycles and lead to both habitats being alternately subsidized. Although this process is well known for prey subsidies in stream-riparian forest ecotones, few studies are available for other systems or subsidy types. Moreover, the effects of transport intensity on this expected alternate subsidy exchange are still poorly understood. We assessed whether subsidy input and allochthonous carbon assimilation by resident benthic invertebrates alternated between adjacent mangroves and salt marshes during peaks of detritus productivity (summer and winter, respectively) in a subtropical estuary, by using detritus trapping techniques and stable isotope ratios. Sampling was performed simultaneously in the sheltered (inner sector) and exposed (outer sector) regions of the estuary to assess the influence of different physical conditions on the intensity of subsidy flow. Transport of mangrove litter into the salt marsh occurred mainly in the summer in both sectors; however, most of the litter remained trapped in the marsh boundary. The mixing model also showed that there was little influence of allochthonous carbon in the diet of salt marsh benthic invertebrates. Marsh litter supply to mangroves did not vary significantly between seasons but was significantly higher in the outer than in the inner sector. Likewise, the mixing model showed great contribution of salt marsh carbon to the diet of benthic invertebrates from the outer-sector mangroves, whereas autochthonous carbon predominated in those from the inner mangroves. Our findings reinforce the model that trophic connectivity relies on the relative proportion of allochthonous (subsidy) and autochthonous resources rather than only on asymmetric productivity between habitats. Differences in the proportion of resources result from interaction among productivity, permeability, and transport vectors that lead to many states of trophic connectivity.

TI  - FLUXES AND NUTRIENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN A SALT MARSH WITH STRONG LOAD OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS AND THE ADJACENT WATERS
T2  - Boletin de la Sociedad de Biologia de Concepcion
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of untreated sewage and fishing industries effluents on a water body of salt marsh and their eutrophication impact on coastal water of Concepcion Bay [Chile] are described. The salt marsh is about 0.6% of the total area of the bay and is located in a populated and highly industrialized zone. The results revealed that the distribution of nutrients in the adjacent coastal water is governed by the tidal regime and, consequently, the exchange of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter between the salt marsh and the coastal water was estimated. Finally, the comparison of data published in 1977 with the information obtained in this study shows that the salt marsh has undergone an extreme ecological deterioration during a ten years period. A deficiency of a policy on coastal zone management has produced a deep damage of the physical environment, natural life and the life quality for the neighbouring residential population.

TI  - Natural Cycles and Transfer of Mercury Through Pacific Coastal Marsh Vegetation Dominated by Spartina foliosa and Salicornia virginica
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential for marsh plants to be vectors in the transport of mercury species was studied in the natural, mature, tidal China Camp salt marsh on San Pablo Bay. The fluxes of organic matter, mercury (THg), and monomethylmercury (MeHg) were studied in natural stands of Spartina foliosa and Salicornia virginica. Seasonal fluxes from the sediment into aboveground biomass of live plants and subsequent transfer into the dead plant community by mortality were measured. Loss of THg and MeHg from the dead plant community through fragmentation, leaching, and excretion were calculated and were similar to net uptake. Seasonal data were added up to calculate annual mass balances. In S. foliosa, annual net production was 1,757 g DW m2, and the annual net uptakes in the aboveground biomass were 305 mu g THg m2 and 5.720 mu g MeHg m-2. In S. virginica, annual net production was 2,117 g DW m2, and the annual net uptakes in aboveground biomass were 99.120 mu g THg m-2 and 1.990 mu g MeHg m-2. Of both plant species studied, S. foliosa had a slightly lower production rate but greater mercury species uptake and loss rates than S. virginica, and, consequently, it is to be expected that S. foliosa matter may affect the local and possibly the regional food web relatively more than S. virginica. However, the actual effects of the input of mercury-species-containing plant-derived particulate matter into the food webs would depend on trophic level, food preference, seasonal cycle of the consumer, total sediment surface area vegetated, location of the vegetation in the marsh landscape, and estuary bay landscape. Since the levels of mercury species in dead plant material greatly exceed those in live plant material (on a dry weight basis), detritivores would ingest greater mercury species concentrations than herbivores, and consumers of S. foliosa would ingest more than consumers of S. virginica. The greatest THg and MeHg losses of both plant species due to mortality and to fragmentation-leaching-excretion occurred in late spring and early autumn, which corresponds to peak MeHg levels observed in sediments of coastal systems of previous studies, suggesting enhanced THg-MeHg export from the marsh to the nearshore sediment.

TI  - Effects of sea level induced disturbances on high salt marsh metabolism
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes, which provide a transition between the marine and terrestrial environments around much of the temperate world, will be the first ecosystem to feel the effects of an increased rate of sea level rise. This study examined the metabolic responses of a high salt marsh to increased inundation and wrack deposition associated with sea level rise. We measured changes in ecosystem and soil photosynthesis and respiration by analyzing carbon dioxide fluxes in the light and dark. Data from seasonal flux measurements were combined with continuously measured light and temperature data to develop a model that estimated annual production and respiration. Results suggested that increased inundation will reduce respiration rates to a greater extent than production, yielding a moderate net loss of organic carbon from the high marsh. The model also predicted a substantial loss of organic carbon from wrack-affected areas. This decreased organic carbon input may play an important role in the ability of the marsh to maintain elevation relative to sea level rise.

TI  - The impact of drying on structure of sedimentary organic matter in wetlands: Probing with native and amended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland sediments undergo dry-wet cycles that may change their structural properties and affect geochemical behavior of associated organic compounds. In this study, we examined the effect of drying on particle size distributions and the rapid (24 h) sorption reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with salt marsh sediments in Nueces Delta, South Texas. Drying reduced the fraction of fine particles in organically richer sediments, indicating structural rearrangement of organic matter and mineral aggregates. Among the 16 EPA priority PAHs examined, dried sediment preferentially released 1.0-7.5% of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene to added seawater (solid: water mass ratio of 1/100)- significantly greater than release from sediments maintained in the wet state. On the other hand, drying also increased the affinity of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) for experimentally amended (deuterated) phenanthrene relative to continually wet sediments. Further, deuterated phenanthrene was even more effectively retained when it was added to wet sediment that was subsequently dried and rewetted.These apparently contradictory results can be reconciled and explained by SOM having a heterogeneous distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones - e.g., a zonal model. We propose that drying changed the orientation of amphiphilic SOM, exposing hydrophobic zones and promoting the release of some of theft native PAHs to water. Freshly amended PAHs were only able to penetrate into the surface hydrophobic zone and/or deeper but rapidly accessible ("kinetics") zone in wet sediments clue to the brief adsorption contact time. Subsequent drying presumably then induced structural changes in SOM that isolated these amended PAHs in sites inaccessible to water exchange in the next rewetting. These results provide insights into structural changes of SOM upon drying, and help predict the fate of compounds such as organic contaminants during drought/flood oscillations.

TI  - Daily and inter-tidal variations of Fe, Mn and Hg in the water column of a contaminated salt marsh: Halophytes effect
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been shown that salt marshes may function as efficient sinks for contaminants, namely for mercury. At the rhizo-sediment Hg may be associated with Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides, precipitated as sulphides or incorporated into organic matter. However, to our knowledge, in situ studies have not focused on the related processes at a daily or tidal cycle scales. Thus, the present work aims to study the effect of a common salt marsh halophyte in temperate latitudes (Sarcocornia perennis) on dissolved Fe, Mn and Hg concentrations in the water column. The in situ approach was carried out at a mercury-contaminated salt marsh and at the adjacent non-vegetated area (distance <= 4 m), covering two consecutive tidal cycles in order to include the photosynthetic active period and the night processes. During high tide no daily or spatial effects were observed on the concentrations of Mn, Fe and Hg in the water column, due to the dilution effect of the incoming seawater. During low tide the concentrations of Mn, Fe and Hg were significantly higher in the overlaying water column of the salt marsh. At S. perennis mats the concentration of dissolved total Hg was significantly related with the concentration of Mn (r = 0.459, p = 0.028, n = 23), but not with that of Fe (r = 0.367, p 0.085, n = 23) while no significant relations were found at the adjacent non-vegetated sediments.This study highlights the complexity of the biogeochemical processes that take place in salt marshes, due to the daily photosynthetic cycle of halophytes and to the tidal action in rnesotidal systems.

TI  - A multiproxy study of intertidal surface sediments from two macrotidal estuarine systems (Canche, Authie) in northern France: Insights into environmental processes
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are considered one of the most dynamic ecosystems in the world, ensuring high production and transfer of large quantities of organic matter (OM) from continents to the ocean. Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.

T2  - VEGETATIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CO2 AND BIOSPHERE
CL  - WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Elevated atmospheric CO2 is known to stimulate photosynthesis and growth of plants with the C3 pathway but less of plants with the C4 pathway. An increase in the CO2 concentration can therefore be expected to change the competitive interactions between C3 and C4 species. The effect of long term exposure to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 concentration + 340 mumol CO2 mol-1) on a salt marsh vegetation with both C3 and C4 species was investigated. Elevated CO2 increased the biomass of the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi growing in a pure stand, while the biomass of the C4 grass Spartina patens in a monospecific community was not affected. In the mixed C3/C4 community the C3 sedge showed a very large relative increase in biomass in elevated CO2 while the biomass of the C4 species declined.The C4 grass Spartina patens dominated the higher areas of the salt marsh, while the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi was most abundant at the lower elevations, and the mixed community occupied intermediate elevations. Scirpus growth may have been restricted by drought and salt stress at the higher elevations, while Spartina growth at the lower elevations may be affected by the higher frequency of flooding. Elevated CO2 may affect the species distribution in the salt marsh if it allows Scirpus to grow at higher elevations where it in turn may affect the growth of Spartina.

TI  - Contribution of denitrification to nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen cycling in tidal creek sediments of a New England salt marsh
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of denitrification to sediment metabolism was studied at 2 sites (muddy and sandy) in unvegetated tidal creek sediments from a small Cape Cod, USA, salt marsh receiving nitrate-enriched groundwater flows (32 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Simultaneous measurements of sediment N-2, CO2, O-2, and dissolved inorganic N fluxes were made over annual cycles. A total of 46% of the ammonium remineralized within the sediments was transformed to N-2 by coupled nitrification-denitrification (D-n). Denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria contributed 15 and 18% to total sediment C and O cycling, respectively. C, N, and O-2 cycling rates were limited by both temperature and the availability of labile organic matter. Muddy sediment C content was twice that of sandy sediments, but was half as labile, resulting in similar mean metabolic rates between sediment types (mean muddy and sandy O-2 consumption rates were 62 and 58 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively; CO2 production was 58 and 46 mmol m(-2) d(-1); and D-n was 5.4 and 4.9 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)). Sediment delta(13)C (-18.5 and -20.8parts per thousand) and the molar CO2:N flux ratio (6.1) at both sites are consistent with a sediment metabolism based on algal rather than macrophytic biomass, and groundwater nitrate was the dominant source of N supporting algal growth. Annually, D-n accounted for 72% of total denitrification, with the remainder accounted for by water column-supported denitrification. Since all the denitrified N originated from groundwater nitrate, algal uptake must have initially out-competed denitrification for water column nitrate, but nearly half of this algal N was subsequently remineralized and denitrified.

TI  - Influence of halophytes and metal contamination on salt marsh macro-benthic communities
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since an important fraction of the organic matter produced by salt marshes is decomposed in situ, macro-benthic communities are particularly exposed to the trace metals retained by these systems. Yet, few studies have investigated the macro-benthic communities using the between-root sediment habitat of the salt marsh halophytes (salt-tolerant plants), or the effect of trace metal pollution on its population dynamics. In the present study, samples were collected in vegetated and unvegetated sediment, in three salt marshes in the Tagus estuary, for trace metal concentration determination in the sediment and in the halophytes roots, grain size determination and macro-benthic organism identification. Data analysis revealed that the distribution of macro-benthic organisms is mainly determined by metal contamination, metal type and by the presence/absence of halophytes, not by the halophyte species. Five different associations were identified: resistant organisms were associated with the highest concentrations of lead (sediment); tolerant organisms with zinc, copper (sediment and roots) and lead (roots); cadmium in the sediment with a lack of macro-benthic life; sensitive organisms with low levels of metals except for cadmium in the roots; and macro-benthos typical of intertidal mudflats with unvegetated areas with low metal contamination.

AB  - Anoxygenic phototrophs were isolated from salt marsh sediments and creek waters.     Several of the isolates obtained were able to consume dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) during growth in the light.    Rhodopseudomonas sulfidophila was the most abundant phototroph in the marsh and also    displayed the greatest ability to metabolize DMS.      DMS stimulated CO2 fixation in R. sulfidophila. DMSO was the most likely product of DMS metabolism.

M3  - Data set
AB  - Salt marshes are complex systems comprising ephemerally flooded, vegetated platforms hydraulically fed by tidal creeks. Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a ponds proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Environmental factors affecting bacterioplankton and phytoplankton dynamics in confined Mediterranean salt marshes (NE Spain)
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental factors accountable for bacterioplankton or phytoplankton biomass dominance were analysed in a confined Mediterranean salt marsh (Emporda Wetlands, NE Spain). Two basins located in the same salt marsh, and with differences in size and catchment's area were compared, during four characteristic situations of the hydroperiod. Since bacterio- or phytoplankton relationships may be affected by other factors such as diel variations or vertical differences in nutrient composition and distribution, high frequency fluctuations due to these factors were also taken into account. Differences in catchment area appeared to be the more plausible explanation of differences in nutrient and organic carbon accumulation among basins, since during confinement basins essentially accumulate the allochthonous nutrient and organic matter supplies that previously entered by runoff. DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) favoured the bacterioplankton biomass increase, but also was the main variable significantly affecting phytoplankton biomass. Basins showed marked differences in bacterio- and phytoplankton dominances. Relationships between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were positive, negative or not significant, depending on the basin and on the period of the year. The phytoplankton mixotrophic capabilities, both phagotrophy and osmotrophy, and their production of UV-screening compounds, as sunscreen, may explain the significant correlation between DOC and phytoplankton biomass, and the significant effect of phytoplankton on bacterioplankton found in these ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of impoundment on vertical accretion of coastal marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical accretion of impounded marsh and adjacent natural marsh at four sites in southwestern Louisiana was estimated in 1994 by determining the depth of a stratum containing Cs-137 deposited in 1963. With relative marsh elevation, soil bulk density, organic matter content, and organic and mineral matter accumulation rates were used to describe soil formation. Three sites were impounded in 1956 and one site in 1951. Impounded marshes had lower marsh surface elevation than natural marshes because of hydrologic isolation from tidal sediment subsidies and substrate oxidation during forced drying. The elevation of natural marshes ranged from 12 cm to 42 cm higher than the elevation of the impounded marshes in 1963 and from 20 cm to 32 cm higher in 1994. Vertical accretion between 1963 and 1994 ranged from 9 cm to 28 cm in impounded marsh and from 15 cm to 21.5 cm in natural marsh. Only in impounded marsh that remained permanently flooded was accretion greater than in natural marsh.

TI  - EFFECTS OF TIDALLY MEDIATED LITTER MOISTURE-CONTENT ON DECOMPOSITION OF SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA AND S-PATENS
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relationships between flooding frequency, flooding duration, litter moisture levels, and litter decay rates were investigated across the natural hydrologic gradient common to intertidal salt marshes. The effects on litter decay of natural and experimental alterations of litter moisture content were assessed in both field litterbag experiments (conducted in a southern New Jersey salt marsh from 1989 to 1990) and laboratory incubations (1990). Overall, tidally mediated litter moisture content was the dominant factor controlling litter decay throughout the vegetated marsh. Rates of carbon loss were most closely related to litter moisture levels (r = 0.84), which were directly related to flooding frequency (r = 0.66) and duration (r = 0.63). Litter moisture levels were related to elevation within the tidal range due to increasing surface elevation from creekbank to high marsh (ca. 54 cm) and height of litter above the sediment surface. Carbon losses from litter of short and tall form Spartina alterniflora Loisel. and S. patens (Aiton) Muhl. along the marsh elevation gradient indicate that while some of the variations in decay rates may be due to litter type, litter moisture accounted for most of the observed variation between marsh zones and within each litter type. Moisture levels are also affected by the water retention capacity of each litter type, which may also secondarily influence decay rates. Short-term incubations of litter indicated that CO2 evolution was positively related to moisture content with negligible respiration at moisture levels below 15% (fresh mass), increasing to a maximum between 65 and 7.5% depending upon litter type. Since most Spartina spp. litter remains above the marsh surface where it maintains a lower moisture content than surface litter, the use of surface litterbags may overestimate rates of carbon loss in some systems. In addition, since changes in elevation of only a few centimeters had significant effects on both litter moisture levels and decay rates, slight changes in tidal regime may have important consequences for organic matter cycling in salt marshes by affecting litter decomposition processes.

TI  - FORAMINIFERA OF RELICT SALT MARSH DEPOSITS ST. CATHERINES ISLAND GEORGIA USA TAPHONOMIC IMPLICATIONS
T2  - Palaios
M3  - Article
AB  - Relict salt marsh sediments exposed along the eastern coast of St. Catherines Island, Georgia (about 200 to 1500 + years in age), contain fairly diverse and abundant foraminifera in addition to diatoms, ostracodes, fecal pellets, and partiulate organic matter. Shallow subsurface sediment samples were collected from several relict low marsh habitats or subenvironments: ponded water marsh, streamside marsh, levee marsh, and creek bank/channel areas. Relict foraminiferal assemblages are  overwhelmingly dominated by Arenoparrella mexicana, which accounted for 43% of all specimens identified. Other common and widely distributed species include: Siphotrochammina lobata, Trochammina inflata, Trochammina macrescens, Textularia palustris, and Miliammina fusca. In addition, Ammotium salsum and Reophax nana are abundant locally. Patterns of species abundance in relict marsh sediments differ from those in surface sediments of modern marshes of neighboring Sapelo Island, reflecting the infaunal occurrence of Arenoparrella mexicana in marshes of coastal Georgia, and perhaps the selective preservation of agglutinated species. Broad foraminiferal associations are also recognized, but they do not correspond to specific salt marsh habitats or subenvironments as closely as do their modern counterparts. Although all samples were collected from relict low marsh habitats, foraminiferal assemblages contain several typical high marsh representatives which may reflect an  unusually high extension of low marsh halophytes into the intertidal zone in this area.

TI  - The Effect of Marsh Age on Ecosystem Function in a Rapidly Transgressing Marsh
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sea-level rise is leading to the migration of marshes into coastal forests throughout North America. Marsh migration represents a primary mechanism for marsh survival in the face of sea-level rise and leads to a fundamental reorganization of vegetation communities. Yet, the ecological implications of these changes remain unknown. To evaluate the effect of marsh migration on ecosystem function, we compared habitat, primary production, vertical accretion, nutrient cycling, and carbon accumulation between new and old salt marsh on Goodwin Island (Virginia, USA) where salt marsh is migrating landward into rapidly retreating coastal forest. Using historical imagery and radioisotopic dating of sediment cores, we determined marsh age (< 3 to approximately 616 years) across the landscape. We found that salt marsh functions generally depended more on elevation and/or landscape position than marsh age. Primary production and nutrient cycling (%C and %N soil content) did not vary significantly with marsh age. Accretion and carbon accumulation rates varied predictably with elevation in old marsh but not in new marsh. Instead, trends in soil formation were controlled by the colonization of Phragmites australis, a dominant plant in migrating marsh-forest boundaries along the Atlantic Coast. Vegetation zonation patterns were more clearly defined in old marsh, indicating that habitat types take time to develop. However, these vegetation differences did not translate to consistently different ecological functions. These observations suggest that marsh migration does not lead to permanent differences in ecological functions between new and old marsh, rather ecological functions will converge as new marsh ages.

TI  - Impact of sea level change on coastal soil organic matter, priming effects and prokaryotic community assembly
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are coastal areas storing high amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) while simultaneously being prone to tidal changes. Here, SOM-decomposition and accompanied priming effects (PE), which describe interactions between labile and old SOM, were studied under controlled flooding conditions. Soil samples from two Wadden Sea salt marsh zones, pioneer (Pio), flooded two times/day, and lower salt marsh (Low), flooded similar to eight times/month, were measured for 56 days concerning CO2-efflux and prokaryotic community shifts during three different inundation-treatments: total-drained (Drained), all-time-flooded (Waterlogged) or temporal-flooding (Tidal). Priming was induced by C-14-glucose addition. CO2-efflux from soil followed Low>Pio and Tidal>Drained>Waterlogged, likely due to O-2-depletion and moisture maintenance, two key factors governed by tidal inundation with regard to SOM mineralisation. PEs in both zones were positive (Drained) or absent (Waterlogged, Tidal), presumably as a result of prokaryotes switching from production of extracellular enzymes to direct incorporation of labile C. A doubled amount of prokaryotic biomass in Low compared to Pio probably induced higher chances of cometabolic effects and higher PE. 16S-rRNA-gene-amplicon-based analysis revealed differences in bacterial and archaeal community composition between both zones, revealing temporal niche adaptation with flooding treatment. Strongest alterations were found in Drained, likely due to inundation-mediated changes in C-binding capacities.

TI  - UTILIZATION OF NATURAL AND TRANSPLANTED TEXAS SALT MARSHES BY FISH AND DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat utilization by fish and decapod crustaceans was compared among 3 transplanted and 3 natural Spartina alterniflora marshes on the Texas (USA) coast during spring 1986. Created marshes had been transplanted on dredged material and were approximately 2 to 5 yr old at the time of sampling. Although conclusions are limited to the spring season, the use of replicate marshes allowed us to test the null hypothesis that transplanted marshes on the Texas coast were equivalent to natural marshes. Mean values for stem density and above-ground biomass of S. alterniflora were consistently higher in the transplanted marshes, and the difference was statistically significant for stem density. Macro-organic matter (MOM) in the upper 5 cm of sediment was significantly lower in the transplanted marshes. Densities of polychaetes and amphipods within transplanted marshes were positively correlated with this MOM. Transplanted marshes had significantly lower densities of decapod crustacea (primarily daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio and juvenile brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus) compared with natural marshes. This reduced utilization may have been a response to low densities of benthic food organisms, and densities of decapods were positively correlated with densities of prey in sediment cores. In contrast to the utilization pattern of decapods, densities of fish (dominated by the darter goby Gobionellus boleosoma and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) were similar between natural and transplanted marshes. These small fish may rely on salt marshes more for protective cover than for enhanced food resources, and above-ground structure in the transplanted marshes may have adequately provided this function. Comparisons of functional equivalency between natural and transplanted salt marshes require adequate information on how salt marshes actually function for fish and decapod crustaceans. For example, the use of prey density as an indicator of food value in a marsh can be misleading unless trophic pathways are well understood and access to the marsh surface is considered.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Mineral and Organic Matter Deposition Across Two San Francisco Bay-Delta Tidal Marshes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment deposition in tidal wetlands is a critical process that determines whether vertical growth will keep pace with sea-level rise. However, more information is needed on how sediment deposition varies spatially and temporally across wetlands, including the effects of elevation, tidal inundation, vegetation, and weather. We investigated variation in sediment deposition due to season, distance from channel, channel size, and vegetation composition at low and high salinity tidal marshes in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, California using sediment traps deployed monthly between December 2015 and November 2016. Over the course of the year, sediment deposition ranged widely (1.4 - 174.0 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and averaged 19.5 +/- 3.5 kg m(-2) yr(-1). Deposition increased with flooding duration, decreased with increasing distance from channels, and was highest during the spring and early summer. Higher wind speeds during the spring may have driven re-suspension from mudflats, promoting deposition. Ratios of organic-to-mineral deposition were twice as high at the fresher site and were correlated with differences in vegetation composition between sites. Our results suggest that seasonality, distance from sediment source, salinity regime, and channel size are important sources of spatiotemporal variation in deposition. These results are relevant to accretion sampling and wetland restoration design.

TI  - PAHs levels in Portuguese estuaries and lagoons: Salt marsh plants as potential agents for the containment of PAHs contamination in sediments
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - PAHs contamination in sediments is a subject of current concern since they constitute a secondary source of these pollutants for the water column. Remediation of contaminated sediments is a complex and costly process but salt marsh plants might be useful for hydrocarbons phytoremediation. With this aim, the levels of PAHs were evaluated in sediments of 5 estuaries/lagoons along the Atlantic (Lima, Cavado, Douro and Sado estuaries) and Mediterranean (Ria Formosa) Portuguese coasts, aiming to research the role of different salt marsh plants on PAHs retention/remediation, and whether they contribute for PAHs sequestration or mineralization. In each estuary, a non-colonized sediment and one or more colonized sediments (rhizosediments) were collected representing colonies of 7 salt marsh plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata, Halimione portulacoides, Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritimaand Sarcocornia fruticosa). In general, PAHs levels were low (around 100 mu g kg(-1)), equivalent to background levels found in areas without significant anthropogenic activities. Nevertheless, one site in Sado estuary and one in Douro estuary revealed punctual sources mainly of 4- and 5-ring PAHs.Colonized sediments revealed higher capacity to sequester PAHs via the accumulation of higher contents of organic matter and thinner particulate fractions. J. maritimus, a widespread salt marsh plant, promoted the fixation of PAHs in rhizosediments, to a similar extent as the remaining plants. The exception was H. portulacoides which might have less accumulation potential of PAHs or their degradation in the vicinity of the roots is higher. This study demonstrated that salt marsh plants are a valuable element for the containment of PAH-contaminated sediments, which can then suffer biotic transformations or be available for remediation procedures.

TI  - Geomorphic influences on the contribution of vegetation to soil C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora marshes
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are important hotspots of long-term belowground carbon (C) storage, where plant biomass and allochthonous C can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years. However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.

TI  - Using sediment alginate amendment as a tool in the restoration of Spartina alterniflora marsh
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth and survival of transplanted vegetation for salt marsh restoration can be greatly affected by edaphic conditions. We investigated the potential for an organic carbon sediment amendment, alginate, to enhance establishment and growth of Spartina alterniflora transplants, as well as colonization by macroinvertebrates commonly associated with S. alterniflora (Uca sp. and Littoraria irrorata). Plots were established in a bare mud area previously inhabited by S. alterniflora, and transplant rhizospheres were either treated with alginate or left unamended as controls. Growth of transplanted S. alterniflora and colonization by Uca sp. and L. irrorata were evaluated over portions of three growing seasons. Within the first month post-transplantation, a nonsignificant trend toward greater live stem density emerged, but disappeared completely by week ten. Both Uca sp. and L. irrorata densities were significantly greater in the alginate treatment compared to the control only during the first ten weeks post-transplantation. However, the initial organic content of the sediment in the transplant area was more than twice that in the adjacent natural marsh. Therefore, our findings suggest that a threshold level of sediment organic matter above which alginate addition does not confer an advantage on transplanted S. alterniflora may exist, and the conditions under which amendments are most beneficial to transplanted S. alterniflora should be determined.

TI  - Photosynthate-C-13 allocation in the plant-soil system after C-13-pulse labeling of Phragmites australis in different salt marshes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetic carbon is an integral part of carbon cycle in plant-soil system, also is an important source of soil organic carbon. In this study, C-13 labeling was used for exploring allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in Phragmites australis -soil system undergoing the salt marsh restoration project by freshwater pumping in Yellow River Estuary (YRE), China. Samples were collected from T-0 (before labeling) to 90 days after labeling (T-4), in natural salt marsh, 5-, 10- and 15-year freshwater pumping areas, respectively. The photosynthate-C-13 contents of soil were gradually decreased to 0 mg/g at T-4 in most areas, while it was 2.21 mg/g in 15-year pumping area, higher than other areas at the last sampling time (T-4). And the allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in soil was increased from 3.58% at T-2 to 44.46% at T-3 in natural salt marsh, while no significant change was found in other areas from T-2 to T-3, followed by the significantly higher photosynthate-C-13 proportion in soils of 15-year pumping area at T-4. EC (R-2 = 0.5972) and small macro-aggregates proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.4829) had positive correlations with A photosynthate-C-13 (the value of photosynthate-C-13 in underground part minus that in soil); silt and clay fractions proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.7044) had negative correlation with Delta photosynthate-C-13. Distribution and transportation of photosynthetic carbon in the underground were affected by soil physical and chemical properties.

TI  - Peat Accretion Histories During the Past 6,000 Years in Marshes of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, CA, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how vertical accretion rates in marshes vary through the millennia. Peat cores were collected in remnant and drained marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Cubic smooth spline regression models were used to construct age-depth models and accretion histories for three remnant marshes. Estimated vertical accretion rates at these sites range from 0.03 to 0.49 cm year(-1). The mean contribution of organic matter to soil volume at the remnant marsh sites is generally stable (4.73% to 6.94%), whereas the mean contribution of inorganic matter to soil volume has greater temporal variability (1.40% to 7.92%). The hydrogeomorphic position of each marsh largely determines the inorganic content of peat. Currently, the remnant marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise, but this balance may shift for at least one of the sites under future sea level rise scenarios.

AB  - It is often difficult to explain the importance of wetlands for economic development since these are places filled with water and, apparently, without immediate utility. In this paper, we will bring light to some aspects related to mangroves, salt marshes, and peatlands in Brazil. From the complexities involving wetlands definition and proper location all throughout the country, the worldwide importance of Brazilian Mangroves which could sum-up to nearly 8% of world area of this ecosystem, to the importance of salt marshes to carbon sequestration and its storage into the ocean's deep-waters and the peat soils (Organossolos) distributed in the entire continental area of the country, from low coastal areas (0 m) to mountains regions (2000 m), from northern-tropical to southern-temperate climates, we will seek to pinpoint some threats to these fragile environments, the controversy regarding their proper quantification and some possibilities for future research.

TI  - Presence and mobility of arsenic in estuarine wetland soils of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to assess the presence and availability of arsenic (As) in intertidal marshes of the Scheldt estuary. Arsenic content was determined in soils sampled at 4 sampling depths in 11 marshes, together with other physicochemical characteristics. Subsequently, a greenhouse experiment was set up in which pore water arsenic (As) concentrations were measured 4 times in a 298-day period in 4 marsh soils at different sampling depths (10, 30, 60 and 90 cm) upon adjusting the water table level to 0, 40 and 80 cm below the surface of these soils. The As content in the soil varied significantly with sampling depth and location. Clay and organic matter seem to promote As accumulation in the upper soil layer (0-20 cm below the surface), whereas sulfide precipitation plays a significant role at higher sampling depths (20100 cm below the surface). The As concentrations in the pore water of the greenhouse experiment often significantly exceeded the Flemish soil sanitation thresholds for groundwater. There were indications that As release is not only affected by the reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, but also by e. g. a direct reduction of As(V) to As(III). Below the water table, sulfide precipitation seems to lower As mobility when reducing conditions have been sufficiently established. Above the water table, sulfates and bicarbonates induce As release from the solid soil phase to the pore water.

M3  - Article
AB  - By monitoring weekly for 3 months with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps baited with carbon dioxide (CO2) and light, 12 species of mosquitoes were collected from salt-marsh areas in Topsail Island, North Carolina: Aedes vexans, Anopheles atropos, An. bradleyi, An. crucians, An. punctipennis, Culex pipiens, Cx. restuans, Cx. salinarius, Ochlerotatus sollicitans, Oc. taeniorhynchus, Oc. infirmatus, and Uranotaenia sapphirina. ne hourly activities of common salt-marsh mosquitoes, namely Oc. sollicitans, Oc. taeniorhynchus, An. atropos, An. bradleyi, and Cx. salinarius, were observed from 1700 to 0800 h by using a collection bottle rotator trap baited with 1-octen-3-ol (octenol), CO2, and light. The mosquitoes exhibited different peaks of adult activity, with a significantly greater number of mosquitoes collected from 0600 to 0800 h than from 1700 to 1900 h.

TI  - Fate of plant detritus in a European salt marsh dominated by Atripelx portulacoides (L.) Aellen
T2  - Hydrobiologia
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the organic matter dynamics of a dwarf shrub species, Atriplex portulacoides, which characterizes the majority of ungrazed European salt marshes. These dynamics were investigated by the simultaneous estimation of primary production, litter production, decomposition processes and accumulation of organic matter in sediment. We used harvested biomass techniques and the litter-bag method, as well as more recent techniques such as determination of natural isotopic compositions. The results of this study have been compared with those of other studies of salt marshes of the Eastern Coast of America dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Studies of the fate of halophytic organic matter in salt marshes have shown that processes such as consumption, decomposition, or flooding rapidly could distribute organic material to different compartments of the marsh system. Aboveground productivity of A. portulacoides was 1700 g m-2 yr-1. Approximately 80% of this production was transformed rapidly in necromass. A large part of this dead material (86%) fell as litter directly onto the sediment at the sampling site. The remainder was washed away by tides, either out of the marsh, or into the upper marsh where it accumulated in drift lines. Decomposition of A. portulacoides on the sediment was followed using litter-bags. Decay constants, based on the first order decay function, ranged between 0.0404 d-1 and 0.0113 d-1 and appeared high when compare with data obtained in other American and European salt marshes. Nitrogen immobilisation was not detectable in this decomposition experiment. During decay, nitrogen concentrations increased, whereas absolute amount of nitrogen decreased. After microbial decomposition, plant detritus was rapidly incorporated into sediment. The carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment showed that organic matter in the middle marsh came from both aboveground production of A. portulacoides and microalgae. The patterns for these two kinds of organic matter in different granulometric fractions depended on tidal submersion frequency. During the summer, when the salt marsh was not disturbed by tides, the clay fraction got richer in plant organic matter, whereas, during the other periods, this fraction was characterized by microalgal organic matter. This study provides new data about the dynamic of organic matter. It remains still difficult to establish comparisons between North American and European salt marsh functioning according to the variability of primary production, microbial decomposition and tidal range in these ecosystems.

TI  - Nutrient Retention and Release in Eroding Chesapeake Bay Tidal Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The worldwide loss of coastal wetlands has traditionally been addressed as the loss of ongoing nutrient retention ecosystem services. However, nutrient remineralization from eroded particles may further exacerbate water quality degradation. Using data on nutrient burial and denitrification from northern Chesapeake Bay, along with estimates of the bioavailability of eroded marsh particulates, the changing role of wetlands as an important sink for nutrients is examined. Although the erosion of wetlands results in the reintroduction of nitrogen and phosphorus into open-water habitats, the potential for exacerbating eutrophication is highly diminished by the low lability of wetland organic matter. The impact of such erosion on the cycling of Fe-bound phosphorus from marsh soils is highly dependent on both the amount of inorganic P, its solid phase association with Fe, and its potential remobilization from the estuarine sediments into which it is deposited. Although nutrient sequestration in newly constructed wetlands built from dredged materials suggested a rapid development of nutrient sequestration, a better understanding of nutrient ecosystem services provided by marshes created by transgression into uplands is necessary for understanding the long-term nutrient retention value of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Multiple Stressors Influence Salt Marsh Recovery after a Spring Fire at Mugu Lagoon, CA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first record of fire in Pacific coast salt marshes; the 1993 Green Meadows Fire and the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire burned an area ofSalicornia-dominated salt marsh at Point Mugu, CA. These fires inspire concern about resiliency of ecosystems not adapted to fire, already threatened by sea-level rise (SLR), and under stress from extreme drought. We monitored vegetation percent cover, diversity, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in burned and unburned areas of the salt marsh following the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire and used remotely sensed Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) analysis to verify the in situ data. Two years following the fire, vegetation percent cover in burned areas was significantly lower than in unburned areas, with dominant-species change in recovered areas, and NDVI was lower than pre-fire conditions. Multi-year disturbance, such as fire, presents challenges for salt marsh resilience and dependent species, especially in sites facing multiple stressors. With anticipated higher temperatures, increased aridity, extreme drought, and higher frequency fires becoming a reality for much of the Pacific coast, this study indicates that fire inSalicornia-dominated marshes is a vulnerability that will need to be addressed differently from other grass- or reed-dominated marsh systems.

TI  - Effects of Salinity on the Photosynthesis of Two Poaceous Halophytes
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the difference of C-4 and C-3 photosynthetic pathways in responding to high salinity and its potential role in determining vegetation zonation in coastal saltmarshes, two Poaceous halophytes, C-4 Spartina alterniflora and C-3 Phragmites australis, were studied with different salinities. The results showed that proper salinities were required for both species to maintain optimal photosynthesis. The maximal net assimilation rates of S. alterniflora and P. australis appeared with 400 and 100 mmol L-1 NaCl, respectively. Both species exhibited similar responses of stomatal conductance towards the set salinities, and chlorophyll contents in P. australis were even promoted by 100-400 mmol L-1 NaCl. Although no significant changes in the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II were found in either species treated by NaCl, instant quantum yield of photosystem II of P. australis was significantly decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora increased. We suggest that the zonation between S. alterniflora and P. australis is not exclusively caused by the CO2-concentrating mechanism of the C-4 pathway and stomatal conductance is not a restricting factor for either species. It might be that the electron transfer from photosystem II and the energy use efficiency being limited in the C-3 P. australis grown under high salinity.

TI  - Decomposition dynamics of organic carbon in Spartina alterniflora litter in developing salt marshes
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to characterize the decomposition patterns of total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant organic carbon (RC) and labile organic carbon (LC) in Spartina alterniflora litter, we buried litterbags at S. alterniflora salt marshes of 3-year-old (SAF2011), 5-year-old (SAF2009), 11-year-old (SAF2003), 25-year-old (SAF1989) and S. alterniflora Suaeda salsa salt marsh (SAF-SS) along the Xinyanggang coastal wetland in Yancheng, the largest S. alterniflora salt marsh in China. The results showed that: (1) During the one-year decomposition, the TOG remaining percentage, RC remaining percentage and LC remaining percentage decreased monthly. The RC remaining percentage was higher than the LC remaining percentage, and the remaining percentages of TOG, RC and LC increased with the developmental duration of salt marsh. (2) The organic carbon decomposition rates differed seasonally. The higher decomposition rates of TOG, RC and LC occurred in August, January and June respectively, whereas the lower decomposition rates of TOG and LC occurred in October and February respectively, and the lower decomposition rates of RC were observed in December and February. The decomposition rate of LC was higher than that of RC, while the TOC and LC decomposition rates decreased with the developmental duration of salt marsh. The RC decomposition rates were higher in SAF2011 than in the other salt marshes. (3) After litter decomposition, the ratio of RC to TOC increased, while the ratio of LC to TOC decreased. (4) The annual TOC decomposition rates were 0.3167, 0.2632, 0.2608, 0.2583 and 0.2380 g.g(-1) for SAF1989, SAF2003, SAF2009, SAF2011 and SAF-SS, respectively. These findings suggest that the development duration of salt marsh can affect decomposition processes of organic carbon in litter.

TI  - Trophic Relationships of a Marsh Bird Differ Between Gulf Coast Estuaries
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of North America's tidal marsh habitat has been significantly altered by both natural and man-made processes. Thus, there is a need to understand the trophic ecology of organisms endemic to these ecosystems. We applied carbon (delta (13)C) and nitrogen (delta (15)N) stable isotope analysis, along with isotope mixing models, to egg yolk, liver, and muscle tissues of clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) and their likely prey items. This analysis enabled us to explore variation in trophic niche and diet composition in this important marsh bird in two northern Gulf of Mexico tidal marshes that are river and ocean-dominated. For the river-associated estuary, delta (13)C and delta (15)N of egg yolks, liver, and pectoral muscle tissue samples provided evidence that clapper rails maintained a similar diet during both the winter and the breeding season. A trophic link between C(3) primary productivity and the clapper rail's diet was also indicated as the delta (13)C of clapper rail egg yolks related negatively with the aerial cover of C(3) macrophytes. Clapper rails from the ocean-dominated estuary had a narrower trophic niche and appeared to be utilizing marine resources, particularly, based on modeling of liver stable isotope values. Variation in stable isotope values between egg yolk and liver/muscle in both systems suggests that endogenous resources are important for egg production in clapper rails. These results demonstrate that diet composition, prey source, and niche width of clapper rails can vary significantly across different estuaries and appear to be influenced by hydrological conditions.

TI  - Wetland Soil Co-2 Efflux Along a Latitudinal Gradient of Spatial and Temporal Complexity
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Foundation plant species play an important functional role in modifying microenvironment through vegetation structure and by influencing soil properties. Mangroves and salt marsh differ in vegetation structure, yet offer similar ecosystem services. This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.

M3  - Data set
AB  - Pialassa Baiona is a temperate coastal lagoon connected with the Northwestern Adriatic Sea (44° 280 N and 44°310 E). Sediment cores and surface sediments were collected in two habitats within Pialassa Baiona: a) a salt marsh habitat characterized by the presence of saltmarsh vegetation, and b) a human impacted habitat close to anthropogenic source inputs.Cores were sampled by inserting one cylindrical Plexiglas hand corer (5-cm diameter, 50 cm long) into the sediment to a depth of 20-25 cm, and surface sediment samples (0-5 cm) were collected with a stainless-steel grab sampler. The cores were extruded in the field, sectioned into 1‐2 cm intervals, and analyzed for total organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), carbon isotope ratio (delta13C) and dry bulk density (upper 20 - 25 cm) and analyzed for organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), carbon isotope ratio (delta13C) and dry bulk density.Organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon isotopes (delta13C = [(13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)standard  1] * 1,000) were measured in sediment cores and surface sediments using a using a FINNIGAN Delta Plus XP mass spectrometer directly coupled to Thermo Fisher FLASH 2000 CHNS Elemental Analyzer. OC and TN content was expressed as the weight percentage of dried sediment, and carbon isotope results were reported in the standard delta notation with respect to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite.A three-end member mixing model was used to estimate the relative contribution of the different organic matter (OM) sources: marine phytoplankton (FM), riverine-estuarine phytoplankton (FRE), and C3 saltmarsh plant material (FSM):delta13Csample=delta13CMx FM+delta13CFEx FFE+delta13CSMx FSMC/Nsample=C/NMx FM+C/NFEx FFE+C/NSMx FSM1 = FM+FRE+FSMwhere FM, FRE and FSM are the relative contributions of marine phytoplankton, riverine-estuarine phytoplankton, and saltmarsh plant material, respectively. delta13CM (-18.97) and C/NM (4.95), and delta13CRE (-30.70,) and C/NRE (6.63) represent the end member POC signature recorded during distinct marine and estuarine phytoplankton blooms in the coastal lagoon (Guerra et al., 2013).The C3 saltmarsh plant end-member was selected on the basis of typical delta13CSM (-20.2) and C/NSM (15.35) values for Juncus spp. (Gebrehiwet et al., 2008; Hughes and Sherr, 1983; J.

TI  - Microstructural strength of tidal soils - a rheometric approach to develop pedotransfer functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences in soil stability, especially in visually comparable soils can occur due to microstructural processes and interactions. By investigating these microstructural processes with rheological investigations, it is possible to achieve a better understanding of soil behaviour from the mesoscale (soil aggregates) to macroscale (bulk soil). In this paper, a rheological investigation of the factors influencing microstructural stability of riparian soils was conducted. Homogenized samples of Marshland soils from the riparian zone of the Elbe River (North Germany) were analyzed with amplitude sweeps (AS) under controlled shear deformation in a modular compact rheometer MCR 300 (Anton Paar, Germany) at different matric potentials. A range physicochemical parameters were determined (texture, pH, organic matter, CaCO3 etc.) and these factors were used to parameterize pedotransfer functions.The results indicate a clear dependence of microstructural elasticity on texture and water content. Although the influence of individual physicochemical factors varies depending on texture, the relevant features were identified taking combined effects into account. Thus, stabilizing factors are: organic matter, calcium ions, CaCO3 and pedogenic iron oxides; whereas sodium ions and water content represent structurally unfavorable factors. Based on the determined statistical relationships between rheological and physicochemical parameters, pedotransfer functions (PTF) have been developed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Two New England salt marshes exposed to different N availability were assessed seasonally for 1 yr, creating the first complete salt marsh Si budgets. Triplicate seasonal measurements were collected for aboveground biomass of dominant Spartina species (S. alterniflora Loisel. and S. patens (Aiton) Muhl.), belowground vegetation (roots and rhizomes), sediment, and pore water. Measured Si values (reported as SiO2) diverged in several respects to that of other wetlands. Biogenic Si (BSi) concentrations in S. alterniflora were > 1% of dry weight (dry wt), values higher than previously reported in a temperate salt marsh. Rhizomes had significantly less BSi than roots (0.45% and 1.24% dry wt in the rhizomes and roots, respectively). Roots at the high-N marsh had higher BSi concentrations (average 1.44 +/- 0.11% dry wt) than reported in other wetland plant species. Likewise, sediment amorphous Si (ASi) concentrations (> 12% ASi) were elevated compared with most other temperate wetlands, although the average (4.4% +/- 0.5% ASi dry wt) was within the range of other reported values. A clear pattern toward more Si accumulation at the N-enriched salt marsh was found in the roots, sediment, and pore water, and occasionally in the aboveground vegetation. Unlike other aquatic systems, N enrichment does not result in salt marsh Si limitation, despite the presence of Si-accumulating organisms (marsh grasses). Increased soil respiration, sediment availability, and rates of organic matter decomposition are hypothesized to cause higher Si accumulation at the high-N marsh. This relationship was most pronounced in the summer for S. patens, leading us also to hypothesize that Si accumulation in marsh grasses may be related to temperature stress.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsAs biodiversity losses increase due to global change and human-induced habitat destruction, the relationships between plant traits and ecosystem properties can provide a new level of understanding ecosystem complexity. Using a functional response-effect approach, we show that multiple components of the carbon cycle are determined by a few plant traits, which in turn are strongly affected by environmental conditions.LocationSalt marshes, northwest Germany.MethodsWe explored responses of morphological, chemical and biomass-related plant traits to environmental drivers and examined their effects on carbon cycle properties, i.e. above-ground biomass, above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition. The combined analysis between environmental parameters, functional traits and ecosystem properties used structural equation modelling (SEM).ResultsImportant response and effect traits were leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and below-ground dry mass (BDM, responding to groundwater level and salinity) and leaf C:N ratio (responding to inundation frequency). Inundation and salinity led to increased allocation to below-ground biomass and salt stress adaptation in leaves, which translated into increased decomposition rates. Release from these abiotic controls resulted in standing biomass accumulation, which was controlled by LDMC and canopy height as key traits.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the interacting effects of non-consumable environmental factors and soil resources on morphological, chemical and biomass traits, which affected carbon cycle properties. Loss of species from the community has the potential to change the relationships between environment and vegetation-based ecosystem properties and therefore elicit effects on the multifunctionality of the entire and adjacent ecosystems.

TI  - Dataset: Accretion rates of low intertidal salt marshes in the Pacific Northwest
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Salt-marsh accretion rate was investigated at sites that spanned a gradient in relative rate of sea-level rise in Washington and Oregon. Mean accretion rate over all sites was 3.6 mm yr -1  (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr -1 ), which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate (1.3 mm yr -1 ; sd = 0.6). However, a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr -1  (sd = 1.9) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate. Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate. Lowest accretion rates were recorded at sites with the least sediment supply. Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply. A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine predictions of the effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marshes.

AB  - The present investigation quantifies the biodiversity of the Brachyura and fish living within the natural mangrove Avicennia marina, salt marsh and replanted mangal, and compares relevant features of the abiotic and biotic environments of these habitats. Measurements of sediment organic matter, grain size, soil water pH and the moisture content indicate that the natural mangrove areas have lowest mean grain size, pH, and highest organic and moisture contents. Planted mangrove areas have a higher mean grain size and slightly higher pH, but lower organic and moisture contents. Differences occur between brachyurans in planted and natural mangrove areas, but the biodiversity was similar between salt marsh and natural mangrove areas. Nasima dotilliformis was the only crab which did not occur at all planted mangrove sites, while Serenella leachii was missing from natural mangrove. Juvenile fish species enter mangroves, using these as nursery grounds, and quantitative sampling indicates that mangrove areas, especially pneumatophores, form a special habitat for these small fish.

M3  - Article
AB  - Crude oil exploration and production has been the largest anthropogenic factor contributing to the degradation of Momoge Wetland, China. To study the effects of crude oil on wetland soils, we examined the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), as well as pH and electricity conductivity (EC) from oil sites and uncontaminated areas in the Momoge Wetland. All contaminated areas had significantly higher (p < 0.05) contents of TPH and TOC, but significantly lower (p < 0.05) TN contents than those of the uncontaminated areas. Contaminated sites also exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) pH values, C/N and C/P ratios. For TP contents and EC, no significant changes were detected. The level of soil contamination and impact of oil residuals on soil quality greatly depended on the length of time the oil well was in production. Oil residuals had caused some major changes in the soils' chemical properties in the Momoge Wetland.

AB  - Around the world mangroves occupy around 152,000 km2 of tropical and subtropical coastline.  Mangroves provide critical habitat for estuarine, nearshore, and terrestrial biota and supply crucial services such as shoreline establishment, protection from coastal erosion, coastal livelihood support and atmospheric carbon sequestration. The past and present-day distribution and abundance of mangroves in the Atlantic Eastern Pacific has been established through a combination of habitat suitability, climatic condition, and genetic selection.  Mangrove species have been observed to be expanding poleward and landward across the Gulf of Mexico, where mangroves face the unusual situation of being both excellent at long-distance dispersal and constrained in any northward movement by available habitat.  Though mangrove populations provide many crucial services, little is known about mangrove population genetic structure in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The broad goals of this dissertation were to better understand global mangrove expansion at the cost of salt marsh habitat through literature review and to better understand Avicennia germinans phylogeography in the northern Gulf of Mexico by use of a modern next generation sequencing technique known as double digest RAD-sequencing.  From the literature review, human activities both past and present were found to have significantly altered both salt marsh and mangrove habitat.  Currently salt marsh habitat across the world is experiencing large habitat loss and fragmentation, while mangrove populations are expanding both poleward and landward.  The current loss and fragmentation of salt marsh habitat along with the superiority of the mangrove species dispersal capability suggests that salt marshes across the globe are ripe for mangrove species encroachment and conversion.  For mangrove phylogeography in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the genetic structure and the kinship of Avicennia germinans populations showed highly related populations with low genetic diversity and a high number of individuals with a similar genetic makeup.  Taken together, the results of this study help to suggest future directions for mangrove conservation, mangrove genetics research, and the shift of the mangrove salt marsh ecotone in the GOM.  Understanding the dynamics of these highly variable genetic relationships and the processes of genetic exchange in mangrove populations will be essential to predicting future impacts of climate change and anthropogenic forcing.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic dynamic Links of migratory juvenile brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus were investigated along the South Texas coast from the Aransas Pass to Corpus Christi and Nueces Bay and to the nursery ground in the Nueces Delta. Shrimps and their potential food sources were measured for delta(13)C and delta(15)N ratios between December 1995 and July 1996. During this period, shrimp length increased from 10 to 11 mm, when the animals entered Corpus Christi Bay as larvae, to 80-90 mm, when they returned to Mexico Gulf as sub-adults. Brown shrimp exhibited spatial and temporal delta(13)C variation (from -25.2 to 12.5 parts per thousand), indicating a high diversity of food sources throughout their migration. From delta(13)C values, the main sources used as food sources by juvenile brown shrimp in the Rincon Bayou marsh were Spartina alterniflora and S. spartinae detritus and benthic diatoms. delta(13)C and delta(15)N values showed that organic matter inputs carried by the river inflow can also contribute significantly to the feeding of migratory brown shrimp. In these marsh habitats, shrimp isotopic ratios changed rapidly, suggesting high tissue turnover rates. The study showed that coastal marshes after restoration through the introduction of freshwater inflow may provide feeding habitats favorable for growth and development of juvenile brown shrimp.

AB  - Soil samples under different salt marsh vegetations in Yancheng coastal wetland were collected, and their organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) were determined, aimed to analyze the influence of salt marsh vegetation on the spatial distribution of soil carbon and nitrogen. The results showed that the organic C and total N contents in top soils varied from 1.71 to 7.92 g center dot kg(-1), and from 0.17 to 0.36 g center dot kg(-1), respectively, and there were significant differences among different vegetation zones. The top soils organic C and total N contents in vegetation zones were higher than those in mudflat without vegetation. In the soil profiles in vegetation zones, organic C and total N contents had a trend of decreasing with depth, but changed little below the depth of 15 cm. Soil organic C was significantly positively correlated with soil total N and C/N, but soil total N had no significant correlation with soil C/N.

AB  - Carbon dynamics in vegetated ecosystems are influenced by plants, belowground bacteria, and their interactions. Consequently, quantifying the fate of new plant production, identifying bacterial carbon sources, and evaluating plant-microbe interactions can provide insight to carbon cycling and storage. To follow short-term carbon transformations in a Spartina alterniflora-soil system, we applied C-13-labeled CO2 to aboveground leaves and chased it belowground into roots and bacterial lipids. Plant mesocosms were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h. Incorporation of (CO2)-C-13 by plants and soil microbes was measured immediately after the incubation (Day 0) and 24 h later (Day 1). During a 24 h period, 41-64 % of the (CO2)-C-13 fixed by S. alterniflora was retained in leaves, 2.7-6.4 % was transferred to roots, and 30-55 % was lost via respiration. Small fractions of C-13 assimilated by aboveground leaves were detected belowground in bacterial lipids on Day 1. Enrichment of lipids specific to sulfate reducing bacteria (10-methyl C-16:0, cy-C-17:0) indicated tight coupling between aboveground plant production and belowground anaerobic metabolisms. Overall, we found that a substantial fraction of new production was returned to the atmosphere within 24 h and that belowground bacteria were tightly coupled to plant dynamics.

TI  - Black fire ant mounds modify soil properties and enhanced plant growth in a salt marsh in Argentina
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of mound building ants on soil and vegetation have been described worldwide; however, few studies have explored their effects in salt marsh communities. Here, we studied the effects of the black fire ant Solenopsis richteri on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests. Samplings and transplant experiments showed that plants growing in contact with mounds grew longer, had wider stems and higher root biomass than plants apart from mounds. These results indicate that by affecting sediment characteristics, ants indirectly and positively affect plants condition, with potential cascading up effects on community structure and dynamics. Because mounds are relocated every similar to 3.5 months, bioturbation impacts may extend over time through the whole high marsh, highlighting the role that black fire ants may have in the ecology of southwestern Atlantic marshes.

TI  - Evolution of soil properties following reclamation in coastal areas: A review
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Review
AB  - Reclamation in coastal zones is effective for relieving population pressure and ensuring food safety. Since the 1950s, the development of coastal zones has entered a peak period. At present, the reclamation of coastal zones mainly occurs in developing countries. The coastal reclaimed lands are mainly used for agricultural production, urban and industrial development, and port construction. The scale and scope of reclamation in coastal lands are larger than in interior lands, and pose substantial environmental risks. This review summarizes the trends in soil physicochemical property evolution following reclamation in salt marshes from around the world. The following important conclusions were obtained: physicochemical properties of coastal saline soils (CSSs) significantly improved over the long term following reclamation in Eastern Asia. Long term fertilization and cultivation resulted in modified soil structure [an increase in the proportion of macroaggregates (>250 mu m) and silt (0.002-0.05 mm)], enhancing the capacity for preserving fertility and C sequestration. Reclamation significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and soil properties approached a relatively stable level nearly 30 years after reclamation, especially in Eastern Asia. However, in Europe and North America, SOM in coastal reclaimed soils (CRSs) decreased rapidly after reclamation, and soil acidification was also a severe problem during reclamation. Coastal reclamation could significantly increase soil GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions, further affecting global C cycle. Microbial biomass and activity as well as activities of related enzymes increased gradually in CRS in Eastern Asia, in particular the activities of urease and phosphatase involved in nutrient cycling. In general, physicochemical properties of CRS in Eastern Asia tend to modify, but deteriorate in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, offshore eutrophication, soil heavy metal and organic pollutant concentrations, and salt marsh ecosystem degradation were the most serious environmental risks posed by coastal reclamation. Some strategies to alleviate these risks are put forward. In this review, we also identified priority areas of future research on CRS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The distribution and utility of sea-level indicators in Eurasian sub-Arctic salt marshes (White Sea, Russia)
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Review
AB  - In support of efforts to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL), we investigated the utility of foraminifera, diatoms and bulk-sediment geochemistry (C-13, C:N and parameters measured by Rock-Eval pyrolysis) as sea-level indicators in Eurasian sub-Arctic salt marshes. At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time. We conclude that RSL reconstructions derived from salt-marsh sediment preserved beneath Eurasian sub-Arctic peatlands can provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the Fennoscandian and Eurasian ice sheets.

TI  - Evaluating the Relationship Among Wetland Vertical Development, Elevation Capital, Sea-Level Rise, and Tidal Marsh Sustainability
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerating sea-level rise and human impacts to the coast (e.g., altered sediment supply and hydrology, nutrient loading) influence the accumulation of sediment and organic matter, and thereby impact the ability of coastal tidal wetlands to maintain an elevation consistently within the vegetation growth range. Critical components of marsh sustainability are the marsh elevation within the vegetation growth range (elevation capital) and the rates of marsh surface elevation change and relative sea-level rise. The relationship among these factors and their combined influence on marsh integrity were evaluated by comparing trends in surface elevation change on five salt marsh sites located on three marsh islands in Jamaica Bay, NY, USA. All marsh sites were located in a similar physical setting (i.e., tidal range, sea-level rise rate, sediment supply). The structural integrity of the marshes ranged from densely vegetated (high integrity) to severely deteriorated (low integrity) with elevation capital ranging from high to low, respectively, and included a deteriorating marsh site that was partially restored. Two marshes with high elevation capital maintained their relative position high within the tidal range through a combination of surface sediment deposition and shallow subsurface expansion, and kept pace with local sea-level rise. A marsh with moderate elevation capital showed signs of flooding stress and was deteriorating, but managed to keep pace with local sea-level rise. The deteriorated marsh gained no elevation over the 14-year study and was located too low within the tidal range to support continuous coverage of salt marsh vegetation. Elevation gain in the restored marsh initially lagged behind sea-level rise for 8years, but the elevation trend recovered and kept pace with sea-level rise for the last 5years. A conceptual model is presented that describes the relationship among elevation capital, and rates of marsh elevation gain and sea-level rise. Note that a search for factors influencing wetland loss should focus on process changes to marsh vertical development (e.g., sediment supply, vegetation growth) and climate change effects (e.g., sea-level and temperature rise) that can cause elevation gain to lag behind sea-level rise, and these occur prior to the onset of marsh deterioration.

TI  - FOLIAR RELEASE OF DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPRIONATE FROM SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We report here that substantial quantities of dissolved dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP) are released from live leaves of Spartina alterniflora in Georgia, USA salt marshes during tidal submergence. Mean monthly in situ foliar release rates varied from 0.092 +/- 0.050 to 0.291 +/- 0.289-mu-mol DMSP (g dry wt)-1 h-1. Estimates of tidal release of DMSP from creekbank stands of S. alterniflora varied from 46 +/- 3 to 684 +/- 411-mu-mol DMSP m-2 d-1 with annual losses of 114 mmol DMSP m-2 yr-1 (3.6 g S m-2 yr-1). Substantial quantities of DMSP accumulate on leaf surfaces. Extrafoliar DMSP accumulations on individual plants varied widely from undetectable to > 1-mu-mol (g dry wt)-1. Extrafoliar DMSP accumulations normalized to marsh surface area were generally less-than-or-equal-to 50-mu-mol m-2. Additions of DMSP to salt marsh creek water resulted in a rapid increase in dimethylsulfide (DMS) production. Foliar release of DMSP into tidal water from S. alterniflora may contribute to the production of DMS and related compounds in southeastern S. alterniflora marshes.

TI  - Maintenance of photosynthesis and the antioxidant defence systems have key roles for survival of Halopeplis perfoliata (Amaranthaceae) in a saline environment
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh plants employ various combinations of morphological and physiological adaptations to survive under saline conditions. Little information is available on salinity tolerance mechanisms of Halopeplis perfoliata, a C3 stem succulent halophyte. We investigated the growth, photosynthesis and antioxidant defence mechanisms of H. perfoliata under saline conditions (0, 150, 300 and 600 mM NaCl) in an open greenhouse. Optimal shoot succulence, projected shoot area and relative growth rate were obtained in the low (150 mm NaCl) salinity treatment, while growth was inhibited at the highest salinity (600 mm NaCl). The CO2 compensation point and carbon isotope composition of biomass confirmed C-3 photosynthesis. Increases in salinity did not affect the photosynthetic pigment content or maximum quantum efficiency of PSII of H. perfoliata. Assimilation of CO2 (A) also remained unaffected by salinity. A modest effect on some gas exchange and photochemistry parameters was observed at 600 mm NaCl. With increasing salinity, there was a continual increase in respiration, suggesting utilisation of energy to cope with saline conditions. Under 300 and 600 mm NaCl, there was an increase in H2O2 and MDA with a concomitant rise in AsA, GR content and CAT activity. Hence, H. perfoliata appears to be an obligate halophyte that can grow up to seawater salinities by modulating photosynthetic gas exchange, photochemistry and the antioxidant defence systems.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon and Nitrogen Storage in Two Southern California Salt Marshes: The Role of Pre-Restoration Vegetation
T2  - Bulletin Southern California Academy of Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon and nitrogen storage represent important ecosystem services provided by salt marshes. To test the importance of vegetation on soil properties, we measured organic carbon, total nitrogen, and belowground biomass in two southern California salt marshes. In both marshes, cores were collected from areas which differed in dominant vegetation cover prior to the restoration of tidal influence. There were no differences in organic carbon or total nitrogen density between vegetation classes at either site; however, a relationship between belowground biomass and soil organic carbon suggests that vegetation may influence soil properties.

TI  - Biomass-size spectra in aquatic communities in shallow fluctuating Mediterranean salt marshes (Emporda wetlands, NE Spain)
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of biomass among phytoplankton and free-living invertebrates was analysed in a shallow Mediterranean salt marsh submitted to fluctuating water level. Among phytoplankton, biomass accumulated in sizes dominated by mixotrophic species, indicating a competitive advantage for these species, which also prey on other smaller primary producers. Among invertebrates, biomass accumulated in the larger sizes, corresponding to species which partially exploit other nearby systems, such as the aerial environment (insects), or to those able to exploit particulated organic matter in marsh-bed sediment (amphipods). Biomass distribution models developed for pelagic systems are discussed in relation to fluctuating temporary waters. The integrated spectrum approximated (r(2) = 0.96) a Pareto distribution with a slope of c = 1.38. Intense disturbances caused a decrease in r(2) and an increase in c. Under stable conditions, two different tendencies were observed, depending on the degree of eutrophy of the basins: higher values of c were measured in the more eutrophic basins, and lower values in the less eutrophic ones. We hypothesize that highly irregular nutrient input could explain these differences.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration of a salt marsh in southern South America with coupled Penman-Monteith and surface resistance models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most recommended method to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) of vegetated surfaces with different soil moisture conditions is the Penman-Monteith equation (PM). Canopy and soil conditions are parameterized through the surface resistance or conductance, while the contribution of the canopy to ET is measured by the canopy resistance. The study of natural ecosystems has gained interest because of its importance in water and carbon cycles. However, unlike monocultures, natural environments are composed of a mixture of species that make the estimation of ET with PM troublesome. This feature makes them suitable for ET estimation considering the contribution of both, the canopy and the soil represented by the surface resistance (r(s)), or the contribution of the canopy, represented by the canopy resistance (r(c)). This work aims to model the surface and canopy resistances using conventional meteorological, biological and pedological variables observed at a salt marsh used for livestock production in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Twelve models (M1 to M12) based on the net solar radiation (R-n), air temperature (T-a), air relative humidity (RH), surface wind velocity (U), dew point departure (D-p), aerodynamic resistance (r(a)), leaf area index (LAI) and volumetric soil water content (v(s)) were obtained using two different regression methodologies. Surface resistances during daytime were calculated inverting the PM equation with ET fluxes measured with the eddy covariance method. PM-derived r(s) varied between 20 and 1000 s m(-1), with a median of 137 s m(-1). From 1620 observations, 468 were used for model calibration while 1152 for model validation. M5 and M11 with R-n, RH, r(a), LAI predictor variables were the best models with 80.8 s m(-1) root mean square error, 0.51 determination coefficient, 0.69 and 0.65 index of agreement, respectively. The modelled resistances allowed the estimation of latent heat fluxes with a root mean quadratic error varying from 60.7 to 69.5 Wm(-2). These results show the possibility to achieve r(s) from a minimum set of variables easily measured in the field which in turn, allows to estimate the ET of salt marsh ecosystems with scarce meteorological information.

TI  - Water Chemistry of Managed Freshwater Wetlands on Marine-Derived Soils in Coastal Bay of Fundy, Canada
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterfowl and migratory birds rely on wetland habitat in coastal temperate regions for breeding and feeding. Over the past few decades, freshwater impoundments have been created in the Cumberland Marsh Region of Canada to compensate for regional loss of ecosystem services and habitat. The objective of our study was to determine whether freshwater impoundments underlain by tidal marsh sediments, and located where marine influences exist, are predisposed to higher nutrient levels and more conducive to productive habitat than waterfowl habitat elsewhere in Canada and the northeastern United States. We found that impoundment subsurface waters were generally circumneutral with moderate concentrations of dissolved organic carbon ranging between 6.30 and 13.90mg/L. Furthermore, these impoundments generally had higher concentrations of cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na), anions (Cl-, SO42-), and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon) than other freshwater waterbodies studied for waterfowl in central Ontario, Maine and Nova Scotia, but lower concentrations than found in Prairie potholes. Our data indicate that a lack of hydrological connectivity and nutrient pathways may be limiting impoundments from reaching their full potential for supporting wildlife. We recognize that additional research on fostering ecosystem services from wetland restoration and creation projects is necessary on former tidal marshland.

TI  - Rare earth element distributions in salt marsh sediment cores reveal evidence of environmental lability during bioturbation and diagenetic processes
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and accumulation of rare earth elements (REE) in the labile fraction of sediment cores collected from salt marshes in the Patos Lagoon estuary from southern Brazil were investigated. Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.

TI  - Distribution of Juncus roemerianus in North Carolina tidal marshes: The importance of physical and biotic variables
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical habitat of Juncus roemerianus was examined at nine sites along a salinity gradient in the Care Fear River Estuary, North Carolina. Soil salinity, drainage, redox potential, pH, elevation, percent sand, percent organic matter, and above-ground plant biomass and height were measured at each site, and from these data, the habitat of Juncus roemerianus was determined, All parameters varied over the salinity gradient, with soils at upriver sites having a high sand fraction, low organic fraction, and highest redox potentials, Downriver, well-established marshes had low sand fractions, high organic fractions, and lowest redox potentials, Canonical Discriminant Analysis indicated that each site was statistically different from other sites due to salinity, elevation, and percent organic matter.Mean standing live biomass was 688 g m(-2) and, despite differences in physical and chemical factors among sites, biomass of Juncus roemerianus did not vary, Juncus roemerianus was found to grow equally well within a broad range of physical and chemical habitats but did not occupy the total expanse of its potential habitat at any one site.Extensive overlap in physical habitat occurred between Juncus-dominated communities and adjacent communities dominated by other species, especially in the more established marshes. However, Canonical Discriminant Analysis statistically separated short and tall form Spartina alterniflora, Distichlis spicata, Scirpus robustus, and Juncus roemerianus microhabitats based on elevation and redox potential. Thus, we found zonation in tidal marshes of the Cape Fear River Estuary was based on abiotic factors, but we recognize the importance of plant species interactions and marsh position within the landscape.

TI  - Table_1_Estimating the Potential Blue Carbon Gains From Tidal Marsh Rehabilitation: A Case Study From South Eastern Australia.DOCX
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Historically, coastal "blue carbon" ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) have been impacted and degraded by human intervention, mainly in the form of land acquisition. With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and 210Pb dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered ("control") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha-1year-1). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The species-specificity of litter processing by three species of isopods at the interface between salt marsh and coastal forest habitats in the south-eastern United States was examined.2. To quantify isopod performance, measurements were taken of feeding, digestion and growth of isopods fed on three litter types (Juncus roemerianus , Quercus virginiana and Pinus palustris ) and on artificial diets containing one of three classes of model phenolic compounds (simple phenolics and hydrolysable and condensed tannins).3. To quantify the ecosystem impact of isopods, promotion of microbial respiration, changes in detritus chemistry, and the quantity of litter processed by isopod populations were measured.4. The results support three hypotheses concerning isopod-litter interactions. (i) Isopod performance on different litter types can be predicted based on chemical litter traits, e.g. phenolic concentrations and C : N ratios. (ii) Fully terrestrial isopods are better adapted to the range of phenolics found in angiosperm litter than are semiterrestrial species inhabiting the supralittoral. (iii) Isopod species differ with respect to their impact on decomposition processes due to species-specific digestive capabilities, different effects on microbial decomposition and different rates of net litter processing.5. Because isopods are transitional between semiterrestrial and terrestrial habitats, unlike most other salt marsh detritivores, they are likely to play a unique role in decomposition processes and in the flux of materials between salt marsh and terrestrial habitats.

TI  - Small-Scale Geochemical Heterogeneities and Seasonal Variation of Iron and Sulfide in Salt Marshes Revealed by Two-Dimensional Sensors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Loss of tidal wetlands is a world-wide phenomenon. Many factors may contribute to such loss, but among them are geochemical stressors such as exposure of the marsh plants to elevated levels on hydrogen sulfide in the pore water of the marsh peat. Here we report the results of a study of the geochemistry of iron and sulfide at different seasons in unrestored (JoCo) and partially restored (Big Egg) salt marshes in Jamaica Bay, a highly urbanized estuary in New York City where the loss of salt marsh area has accelerated in recent years. The spatial and temporal 2-dimensional distribution patterns of dissolved Fe2+ and H2S in salt marshes were in situ mapped with high resolution planar sensors for the first time. The vertical profiles of Fe2+ and hydrogen sulfide, as well as related solutes and redox potentials in marsh were also evaluated by sampling the pore water at discrete depths. Sediment cores were collected at various seasons and the solid phase Fe, S, N, C, and chromium reducible sulfide in marsh peat at discrete depths were further investigated in order to study Fe and S cycles, and their relationship to the organic matter cycling at different seasons. Our results revealed that the redox sensitive elements Fe2+ and S2- showed significantly heterogeneous and complex three dimensional distribution patterns in salt marsh, over mm to cm scales, directly associated with the plant roots due to the oxygen leakage from roots and redox diagenetic reactions. We hypothesize that the oxic layers with low/undetected H2S and Fe2+ formed around roots help marsh plants to survive in the high levels of H2S by reducing sulfide absorption. The overall concentrations of Fe2+ and H2S and distribution patterns also seasonally varied with temperature change. H2S level in JoCo sampling site could change from 5 mM in fall season, reflecting significantly seasonal variation in the rates of bacterial oxidation of organic matter at this marsh site. Solid phase Fe and S showed that very high fractions of the diagenetically reactive iron at JoCo and Big Egg were associated with pyrite that can persist for long periods in anoxic sediments. This implies that there is insufficient diagenetically reactive iron to buffer the pore water hydrogen sulfide through formation of iron sulfides at JoCo and Big Egg.

TI  - Effect of an alien species Spartina alterniflora Loisel on biogeochemical processes of intertidal ecosystem in the Jiangsu coastal region, China
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora Loisel, a species vegetating in intertidal flats along the eastern coast of the United States, was introduced in China almost 30 years ago and has become an urgent topic due to its invasiveness in the coastal zone of China. The impacts of this alien species S. alterniflora on intertidal ecosystem processes in the Jiangsu coastland were investigated by comparing the sediment nutrient availability and trace element concentration characteristics in a mudflat and those of a four-year old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. At each study site, fifteen plots were sampled in different seasons to determine the sediment characteristics along the tidal flats. The results suggested that Spartina salt marsh sediments had significantly higher total N, available P, and water content, but lower pH and bulk density than mudflat sediments. Sediment salinity, water content, total N, organic C, and available P decreased along a seaward gradient in the Spartina salt marsh and increased with vegetation biomass. Furthermore, the concentrations of trace elements and some metal elements in the sediment were higher under Spartina although these increases were not significant. Also, in the Spartina marsh, some heavy metals were concentrated in the surface layer of the sediment. The Spartina salt marsh in this study was only four years old; therefore, it is suggested that further study of this alien species on a longer time frame in the Jiangsu coastland should be carried out.

TI  - Elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition accelerate net carbon gain in a brackish marsh
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have an inordinate influence on the global greenhouse gas budget, but how global changes may alter wetland contribution to future greenhouse gas fluxes is poorly understood. We determined the greenhouse gas balance of a tidal marsh exposed to nine years of experimental carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) manipulation. We estimated net carbon (C) gain rates by measuring changes in plant and soil C pools over nine years. In wetland soils that accrete primarily through organic matter inputs, long-term measurements of soil elevation, along with soil C density, provide a robust estimate of net soil C gain. We used net soil C gain along with methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to determine the radiative forcing of the marsh under elevated CO2 and N addition. Nearly all plots exhibited a net gain of C over the study period (up to 203 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and C gain rates were greater with N and CO2 addition. Treatment effects on C gain and methane emissions dominated trends in radiative forcing while nitrous oxide fluxes in all treatments were negligible. Though these soils experience salinities that typically suppress methane emissions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 can stimulate methane emissions, overcoming positive effects of elevated CO2 on C gain, converting brackish marshes that are typically net greenhouse gas sinks into sources. Adding resources, either CO2 or N, will likely increase "blue carbon'' accumulation rates in tidal marshes, but importantly, each resource can have distinct influences on the direction of total greenhouse forcing.

TI  - EFFECT OF SALT-MARSH INUNDATION ON ESTUARINE PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER CHARACTERISTICS
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - During tidal inundation, exchange of particulate organic matter POM between salt marshes and tidal water may occur. This may result in changes in the seston-POM characteristics of the water. We investigated wheter such changes were found after inundation of Saeftinge, a salt marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (SW Netherlands). Seston was collected from a tidal creek of the marsh during 22 flood-ebb tide cycles. The characteristics of the flood and ebb seston samples were assessed by microbial bioassays, pyrolysis-mass spectrometry, and the determination of chlorophyll (a+b). There was a very strong agreement between the seasonal pattern in biodegradability and the seasonal pattern in chemical signature of the seston-POM. During autumn and winter, the degradability of seston-POM in the Westerschelde was relatively low. Neither the degradability nor the chemical characteristics of the POM showed much variation in this period. The enrichment of the POM-pool with phytoplankton appeared to be the major factor increasing the biodegradability and causing the changes in chemical characteristics of seston-POM in the Westerschelde in spring and summer. Only during a 2 mo period in summer did salt marsh inundation result in consistent differences in POM characteristics between flood and ebb: compared to the POM in the flood water, the POM leaving the marsh during the ebb was more refractory. In other periods, salt marsh inundation hardly affected biodegradability and chemical composition of seston-POM. This is considered an indication that the large estuarine salt marsh of Saeftinge is an irrelevant factor in determining the nature of POM in the estuary. The lack of differences between flood and ebb tide seston-POM also suggests that export of vascular plant detritus from this marsh, at least during moderate weather conditions, is insignificant.

TI  - AMMONIUM AND PHOSPHATE DYNAMICS IN A VIRGINIA SALT-MARSH
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Experimental chambers were used in a Virginia salt marsh to partition the tidal flux of dissolved nutrients occurring at the marsh surface and in the water column. On five dates from June to October 1989, six replicate chambers in the short Spartina alterniflora zone were monitored over complete tidal cycles. When reservoir water, used to simulate tidal flooding in the chambers, was initially low in dissolved nutrients, the marsh surface was a source of both ammonium and phosphate to the water column. Calculations of the physical processes of diffusion and advection could not account for total nutrient release from the marsh surface. We hypothesize the primary source of nutrients was organic matter mineralization in surface sediments, which released nutrients into the flooding water column. Assimilation (uptake) of phosphate measured in water-column incubation experiments was nearly equal to phosphate released from the marsh surface. Surface release of ammonium, however, was somewhat greater than water-column uptake. In this salt marsh, benthic production and release of ammonium and phosphate is comparable in magnitude to pelagic consumption, thereby yielding only a small "net" transfer of these nutrients to the estuary.

TI  - Natural purification capacity of tidal flats for organic matters and nutrients: A mesocosm study
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The regulating services by natural tidal flats to purify organic pollutants are increasingly recognized, but a quantitative assessment is very limited. We developed a mesocosm system to determine removal efficiency of organic matters and nutrients by simulating a natural tidal condition. The tidal flat sediments significantly removed waterborne organic pollutants to background levels in similar to 2 and 6-7 days for COD and TP, respectively. This rapid removal of organic matters by natural sediments could be attributed to the microbe community degrading the corresponding pollutants. Temporal trend and degree of removal rates for COD and TP were similar between the bare tidal flat and the salt marsh. Meantime, the salt marsh environment removed waterborne DIP much quickly and also efficiently, implying a high affinity of halophytes on dissolved organic matters. Of note, sedimentary organic sink prevailed in defaunated condition under the smaller bioturbation effect. A mini-review on the purification capacity of natural and/or constructed coastal wetlands generally supported a high efficiency of vegetation to remove various sources of organic matters.

TI  - Increased Organic Carbon Burial in Northern Florida Mangrove-Salt Marsh Transition Zones
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.

TI  - Seasonal partitioning of resource use and constraints on the growth of soil microbes and a forage grass in a grazed Arctic salt-marsh
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal growth responses of plants and soil microorganisms to additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) were examined in goose-grazed and exclosed plots in an Arctic salt marsh. Plants showed strong growth responses to N and NP additions but not to P. Nitrogen levels in the shoots and roots of Puccinellia phryganodes declined as summer progressed. Microbial biomass was low in spring in spite of N and P additions, likely due to C limitation, but values rose in autumn, independent of nutrient treatment, as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased. Glucose addition (C source) elicited a transitory increase in microbial biomass. Multiple plant defoliations by geese had a negative effect on microbial biomass, in spite of the presence of DOC and added N and P, possibly because hypersalinity restricted growth. Plants appear to limit soil inputs of C in summer and compete effectively for resources in contrast to autumn, indicating a temporal partitioning of resources.

TI  - Impact of fertilization on a salt marsh food web in Georgia
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the response of a salt marsh food web to increases in nutrients at 19 coastal sites in Georgia. Fertilization increased the nitrogen content of the two dominant plants, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, indicating that added nutrients were available to and taken up by both species. Fertilization increased Spartina cover, height, and biomass and Juncus height, but led to decreases in Juncus cover and biomass. Fertilization increased abundances of herbivores (grasshoppers) and herbivore damage, but had little effect on decomposers (fungi), and no effect on detritivores (snails). In the laboratory, herbivores and detritivores did not show a feeding preference for fertilized versus control plants of either species, nor did detritivores grow more rapidly on fertilized versus control plants, suggesting that changes in herbivore abundance in the field were driven more by plant size or appearance than by plant nutritional quality. Community patterns in control plots varied predictably among sites (i.e., 17 of 20 regression models examining variation in biological variables across sites were significant), but variation in the effects of fertilization across sites could not be easily predicted (i.e., only 6 of 20 models were significant). Natural variation among sites was typically similar or greater than impacts of fertilization when both were assessed using the coefficient of variation. Overall, these results suggest that eutrophication of salt marshes is likely to have stronger impacts on plants and herbivores than on decomposers and detritivores, and that impacts at any particular site might be hard to distinguish from natural variation among sites.

TI  - Dataset: Does livestock grazing affect sediment deposition and accretion rates in salt marshes?
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Accretion rates, defined as the vertical growth of salt marshes measured in mm per year, may be influenced by grazing livestock in two ways: directly, by increasing soil compaction through trampling, and indirectly, by reducing aboveground biomass and thus decreasing sediment deposition rates measured in g/m2 per year. Although accretion rates and the resulting surface elevation change largely determine the resilience of salt marshes to sea-level rise (SLR), the effect of livestock grazing on accretion rates has been little studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of livestock grazing on salt-marsh accretion rates. We hypothesize that accretion will be lower in grazed compared to ungrazed salt marshes. In four study sites along the mainland coast of the Wadden Sea (in the south-eastern North Sea), accretion rates, sediment deposition rates, and soil compaction of grazed and ungrazed marshes were analysed using the 137Cs radionuclide dating method. Accretion rates were on average 11.6 mm yr-1 during recent decades and thus higher than current and projected rates of SLR. Neither accretion nor sediment deposition rates were significantly different between grazing treatments. Meanwhile, soil compaction was clearly affected by grazing with significantly higher dry bulk density on grazed compared to ungrazed parts. Based on these results, we conclude that other factors influence whether grazing has an effect on accretion and sediment deposition rates and that the effect of grazing on marsh growth does not follow a direct causal chain. It may have a great importance when interacting with other biotic and abiotic processes on the marsh. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Climate drivers of Zizaniopsis miliacea biomass in a Georgia, USA tidal fresh marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal fresh marshes are at least as productive as nearby salt marshes, but much less is known about controls on primary production in tidal fresh vs. salt marshes. We studied a tidal fresh marsh in Georgia, U.S.A., dominated by the C-3 grass Zizaniopsis miliacea. We documented seasonal variation in Z. miliacea above-ground biomass and below-ground macro-organic matter over 1 yr, and annual variation in end-of-season aboveground biomass over 15 yr in creekbank and midmarsh zones. Aboveground biomass showed a distinct peak in July and October. Belowground macro-organic matter was much greater than aboveground biomass and peaked in October. Overall productivity was similar to that of salt marshes downstream. Z. miliacea end-of-season above-ground biomass showed a classic hump-shaped "subsidy-stress" relationship with plot elevation, but on average the creekbank supported about twofold more above-ground biomass than the midmarsh, and both zones varied in biomass about 1.7-fold among years. Annual variation in above-ground biomass was negatively correlated with maximum and mean temperature in both zones, and positively with river discharge in the creekbank zone. Sea level, precipitation and water column salinity showed biologically plausible trends with respect to biomass. The responses of Z. miliacea to abiotic drivers were muted compared with the responses of nearby salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Temperature was more important for Z. miliacea, whereas drivers of porewater salinity were more important in the salt marsh. Likely future changes in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge may pose a threat to the high productivity of tidal fresh marshes.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment cores of 60 cm length were collected from two Tagus estuary salt marshes. At each salt marsh, samples were taken from a non-vegetated zone and one from each of areas dominated by Halimione portulacoides, Spartina maritima and Arthrocnemum fruticosum. Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher. These results point out that plants are an important feature for metal accumulation in salt marshes. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

TI  - Physiological and Ecological Effects of Spilled Motor oil on Inland Salt Marsh Communities: A Mesocosm Study
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have investigated impacts of oil spills on coastal ecosystems, but no previous studies have tested effects of spilled oil on inland salt marshes. This study used experimental mesocosms to test effects of spilled motor oil on inland salt marsh communities in a greenhouse experiment. It was hypothesized that oil exposure would lead to decreases in photosynthesis, chlorophyll, canopy coverage, and biomass. Communities of plants were collected from a salt marsh in Kansas, USA, and used motor oil was applied at 10 L m(-2) to mesocosm soil with a treatment of 10 weeks. In the dominant species, inland salt grass (Distichlis spicata), oil exposure resulted in a 91 % decrease in photosynthetic rates and an 83 % reduction in chlorophyll concentration. Community-level biomass was primarily driven by D. spicata, where above-ground biomass was reduced by 34 % for D. spicata and by 31 % for total community biomass in oil treatments. Canopy coverage measures were similar to biomass measures, with significant reductions in D. spicata with oil exposure and no difference between treatments for less abundant species. Inland marsh plants are sensitive to spilled motor oil. These results could help future studies to determine how salt marsh vegetation is impacted by spilled oil.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen pools in the coastal reclamation area, eastern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in a coastal reclamation area in eastern China were studied based on the ordinary kriging method. The 0-20 cm soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) and soil total nitrogen pool (STNP) ranged from 4.38 to 15.92 Mg/ha and from 0.24 to 2.37 Mg/ha, respectively, during the observed period. The results show there was a low level of spatial variation in both SOC and STN, which is to some extent the result of the same farmland management practiced in this region. The seasonal variation of SOC was attributed to plant growth and crop residue returning back to soil, while the spatial variation was mainly resulted from the fertilization practice. The average 0-20 cm SOCP and STNP were 10.38 +/- A 2.50 and 1.27 +/- A 0.38 Mg/ha, respectively, in the study region, both of which were much lower than in other ecosystems. Further analysis indicated that SOC was positively correlated with STN. This work revealed that the reclamation area from the tidal flat should be a potential sink for SOC and STN.

TI  - Burrowing fauna mediate alternative stable states in the redox cycling of salt marsh sediments
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Anglian salt marsh system (UK) has recently generated intriguing data with respect to sediment biogeochemistry. Neighbouring ponds in these salt marshes show two distinct regimes of redox cycling: the sediments are either iron-rich and bioturbated, or they are sulphide-rich and unbioturbated. No conclusive explanation has yet been given for this remarkable spatial co-occurrence. Here, we quantify the geochemical cycling in both pond types, using pore-water analyses and solid-phase speciation. Our results demonstrate that differences in solid-phase carbon and iron inputs are likely small between pond types, and so these cannot act as the direct driver of the observed redox dichotomy. Instead, our results suggest that the presence of bioturbation plays a key role in the transition from sulphur-dominated to iron-dominated sediments. The presence of burrowing fauna in marine sediments stimulates the mineralisation of organic matter, increases the iron cycling and limits the build-up of free sulphide. Overall, we propose that the observed dichotomy in pond geochemistry is due to alternative stable states, which result from non-linear interactions in the sedimentary iron and sulphur cycles that are amplified by bioturbation. This way, small differences in solid phase input can result in very different regimes of redox cycling due to positive feedbacks. This non-linearity in the iron and sulphur cycling could be an inherent feature of marine sediments, and hence, alternative stable states could be present in other systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Abiotic control modelling of salt marsh sediments respiratory CO2 fluxes: application to increasing temperature scenarios
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment microbial communities are responsible for several ecosystem key-processes such as decomposition. However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Haloform formation in coastal wetlands along a salinity gradient at South Carolina, United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil haloform emissions are sources of reactive halogens that catalytically deplete ozone in the stratosphere but there are still unknown or underestimated haloform sources. The > 200 000 ha of low-lying tidal freshwater swamps (forests and marshes) in the south-eastern United States could be haloform (CHX3, X = Cl or Br) sources because sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion bring halides inland where they mix with terrestrial humic substances. To evaluate the spatial variation along the common forest-marsh salinity gradient (freshwater wetland, oligohaline wetland and mesohaline saltmarsh), we measured chloroform emissions from in situ chambers and from laboratory incubations of soil and water samples collected from Winyah Bay, South Carolina. The in situ and soil-core haloform emissions were both highest in the oligohaline wetland, whereas the aqueous production was highest in mesohaline saltmarsh. The predominant source shifted from sediment emission to water emission from freshwater wetland to mesohaline saltmarsh. Spreading out soil samples increased soil haloform emission, suggesting that soil pores can trap high amounts of CHCl3. Soil sterilisation did not suppress CHCl3 emission, indicating the important contribution of abiotic soil CHCl3 formation. Surface wetland water samples from eight locations along a salinity gradient with different management practices (natural v. managed) were subjected to radical-based halogenation by Fenton-like reagents. Halide availability, organic matter source, temperature and light irradiation were all found to affect the radical-based abiotic haloform formation from surface water. This study clearly indicates that soil and water from the studied coastal wetlands are both haloform sources, which however appear to have different formation mechanisms.

TI  - POLYSACCHARIDE ADDITION EFFECTS ON RHIZOSPHERE NITROGEN FIXATION RATES OF THE CALIFORNIA CORDGRASS, SPARTINA FOLIOSA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low nutrient availability in salt marsh ecosystems can potentially limit primary productivity and subsequent carbon export to coastal waters. In temperate marshes with low external nitrogen inputs, nitrogen (N(2)) fixation may enhance availability of usable nitrogen to marsh plant communities and increase their growth. The effects of sub-surface soil amendment of polysaccharides on rhizosphere N(2) fixation, and on plant growth and tissue characteristics of the California cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, were tested in microcosms in a tidal simulator. Polysaccharide was added as alginate extract, and rhizosphere N(2) fixation and plant characteristics were measured over 9 weeks. N(2) fixation rates increased 10-fold in the alginate treatment compared to controls after 1 week of exposure as a result of increased availability of a readily usable form of carbon. N(2) fixation rates in amended sediment were significantly higher than rates in control sediments at weeks 1 and 3. Although plant characteristics did not differ between treatments, trends of increased number of leaves and shoots in amended plants compared to controls appeared between weeks 7 and 9. The potential for increased plant growth following an increase in N(2) fixation rates warrants further investigation as it may have implications for recovery of N-limited disturbed and restored salt marshes.

TI  - Tidal rewetting in salt marshes triggers pulses of nitrous oxide emissions but slows carbon dioxide emission
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pulsed emission of CO2 following rainfall in terrestrial ecosystems is well characterized, but coastal wetlands show the opposite trend for CO2, and less is known about the responses of other biogenic greenhouse gases like CH4 and N2O. Tidal inundation in coastal wetlands such as salt marshes is an additional form of rewetting with the potential to cause biological pulses that may not resemble rain-induced pulses. Accurately predicting the carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marshes requires estimates of pulse responses to both rainfall and tidal inundation, in addition to baseline greenhouse gas flux rates. We measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes from salt marsh sediment cores while we simulated rewetting by rainfall and/or tidal inundation, and we measured the total and potentially-active microbial communities at the end of the experiment. Rewetting from tidal inundation and from rainfall led to a short term (begun within 1 h, concluded within similar to 1 d) pulse of N2O, a sustained drop in CO2 emission, but no change in CH4. The N2O pulse peaked on average at 20x and 10x baseline flux rates after tidal inundation and rainfall respectively. Peak N2O fluxes far exceeded the highest emission observed in field measurements at these sites. By global warming potential, the pulse of N2O only slightly offset the drop in CO2 emission, therefore rewetting had a net cooling effect on marsh radiative forcing. Microbial communities were similar in rewetted and non-rewetted cores two days after rewetting, which reflects rapid recovery and/or resilience of the community to rewetting. We estimated the contribution of pulsed vs. baseline N2O emissions to annual totals by modelling rewetting events over 65-year tide gauge and precipitation records, and found that pulsed emissions constitute the majority of salt marsh N2O emissions, and could constitute the entirety in marshes with a net-sink baseline.

TI  - Utilization of invasive tamarisk by salt marsh consumers
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasions of coastal wetlands are rapidly changing the structure and function of these systems globally. Alteration of litter dynamics represents one of the fundamental impacts of an invasive plant on salt marsh ecosystems. Tamarisk species (Tamarix spp.), which extensively invade terrestrial and riparian habitats, have been demonstrated to enter food webs in these ecosystems. However, the trophic impacts of the relatively new invasion of tamarisk into marine ecosystem have not been assessed. We evaluated the trophic consequences of invasion by tamarisk for detrital food chains in the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve salt marsh using litter dynamics techniques and stable isotope enrichment experiments. The observations of a short residence time for tamarisk combined with relatively low C:N values indicate that tamarisk is a relatively available and labile food source. With an isotopic (N-15) enrichment of tamarisk, we demonstrated that numerous macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trophic groups, both within and on the sediment, utilized N-15 derived from labeled tamarisk detritus. Infaunal invertebrate species that took up no or limited N-15 from labeled tamarisk (A. californica, enchytraeid oligochaetes, coleoptera larvae) occurred in lower abundance in the tamarisk-invaded environment. In contrast, species that utilized significant N-15 from the labeled tamarisk, such as psychodid insects, an exotic amphipod, and an oniscid isopod, either did not change or occurred in higher abundance. Our research supports the hypothesis that invasive species can alter the trophic structure of an environment through addition of detritus and can also potentially impact higher trophic levels by shifting dominance within the invertebrate community to species not widely consumed.

TI  - Effects of 10 yr of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization on carbon and nutrient cycling in a tidal freshwater marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal freshwater marshes can protect downstream ecosystems from eutrophication by intercepting excess nutrient loads, but recent studies in salt marshes suggest nutrient loading compromises their structural and functional integrity. Here, we present data on changes in plant biomass, microbial biomass and activity, and soil chemistry from plots in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (GA) fertilized for 10 yr with nitrogen (+N), phosphorus (+P), or nitrogen and phosphorus (+NP). Nitrogen alone doubled aboveground biomass and enhanced microbial activity, specifically rates of potential nitrification, denitrification, and methane production measured in laboratory incubations. Phosphorus alone increased soil P and doubled microbial biomass but did not affect microbial processes. Nitrogen or P alone decreased belowground biomass and soil carbon (C) whereas +NP increased aboveground biomass, microbial biomass and N cycling, and N, P, and C assimilation and burial more than either nutrient alone. Our findings suggest differential nutrient limitation of tidal freshwater macrophytes by N and microbes by P, similar to what has been observed in salt marshes. Macrophytes outcompete microbes for P in response to long-term N and P additions, leading to increased soil C storage through increased inputs of belowground biomass relative to N and P added singly. The susceptibility of tidal freshwater marshes to long-term nutrient enrichment and, hence their ability to mitigate eutrophication will depend on the quantity and relative proportion of N vs. P entering estuaries and tidal wetlands.

TI  - Variation in soil phosphorus, sulfur, and iron pools among south Florida wetlands
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine relationships between soil nutrient status and known gradients in primary production, we collected and analyzed soils from 17 LTER sampling sites along two transects through south Florida wetland ecosystems. Through upstream freshwater marsh, a middle reach including the oligohaline marsh/ mangrove ecotone, and downstream estuarine habitats, we observed systematic variation in soil bulk density, organic content, and pools of phosphorus (P), inorganic sulfur, and extractable iron. Consistent with observed differences in wetland productivity known to be limited by P availability, total P averaged similar to 200 mu g g dw(-1) in soils from the eastern Taylor Slough/Panhandle and was on average three times higher in soils from the western Shark River Slough. Along both transects, the largest pool of phosphorus was the inorganic, carbonate-bound fraction, comprising 35-44% of total P. Greater than 90% of the total inorganic sulfur pool in these south Florida wetland soils was extracted as pyrite. Freshwater marsh sites typically were lower in pyrite sulfur (0.2-0.8 mg g dw(-1)) relative to marsh/mangrove ecotone and downstream estuary sites (0.5-2.9 mg g dw(-1)). Extractable iron in freshwater marsh soils was significantly higher from the Taylor Slough/Panhandle transect (3.2 mg g dw(-1)) relative to the western Shark River Slough transect (1.1 mg g dw(-1)), suggesting spatial variation in sources and/or depositional environments for iron. Further, these soil characteristics represent the collective, integrated signal of ecosystem structure, so any long-term changes in factors like water flow or water quality may be reflected in changes in bulk soil properties. Since the objective of current Everglades restoration initiatives is the enhancement and re-distribution of freshwater flows through the south Florida landscape, the antecedent soil conditions reported here provide a baseline against which future, post-restoration measurements can be compared.

TI  - Carbon accumulation and vertical accretion in a restored versus historic salt marsh in southern Puget Sound, Washington, United States
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Few comparisons exist between vertical accretion (VA) and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in restored versus historic (i.e. reference) marshes. Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1). This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.

TI  - Endothiovibrio diazotrophicus gen. nov., sp nov., a novel nitrogen-fixing, sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium isolated from a salt marsh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel non-phototrophic, marine, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, strain S-1(T), was isolated from a coastal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. Cells are Gram-stain-negative vibrios motile by means of a single polar unsheathed flagellum. S-1(T) is an obligate microaerophile with limited metabolic capacity. It grows chemolithoautotrophically utilizing sulfide and thiosulfate as electron donors, converting these compounds to sulfate, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for carbon fixation. Cells of S-1(T) did not grow on any of a large number of organic carbon sources and there was no evidence for chemoorganoheterotrophic growth. Cells produced internal sulfur globules during growth on sulfide and thiosulfate. S-1(T) is strongly diazotrophic, as demonstrated by N-15(2) fixation and acetylene reduction activity by cells when a fixed nitrogen source is absent from the growth medium. The marine nature of this organism is evident from its ability to grow in 10 to 100% artificial seawater but not at lower concentrations and NaCl alone cannot substitute for sea salts. The major cellular fatty acids are C-16 : (1)omega 7c, C-16 : 0, and C-18 : 1 omega 7c. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol are the major polar lipids. Q8 is the only respiratory quinone. S-1(T) genomic DNA has a G+C content of 67.6 mol%. Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence, S-1(T) shows the closest phylogenetic relationship to non-phototrophic species within the family Thioalkalispiraceae of the class Gammaproteobacteria. The name Endothiovibrio diazotrophicus is proposed for this organism, with S-1(T) as the type strain (ATCC BAA-1439(T)=JCM 17961(T)).

TI  - Marsh-atmosphere CO2 exchange in a New England salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in a high marsh dominated salt marsh during the months of May to October in 2012-2014. Tidal inundation at the site occurred only during biweekly spring tides, during which we observed a reduction in fluxes during day and night. We estimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) using a modified PLIRTLE model, which requires photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as control variables. NDVI decreased during inundation, when the marsh canopy was submerged. Two-time series of NDVI, including and excluding effects of tidal inundation, allowed us to quantify the flux reduction during inundation. The effect of the flux reduction was small (2-4%) at our site, but is likely higher for marshes at a lower elevation. From May to October, GPP averaged -863 g C m(-2), R-eco averaged 591 g C m(-2), and NEE averaged -291 g C m(-2). In 2012, which was an exceptionally warm year, we observed an early start of net carbon uptake but higher respiration than in 2013 and 2014 due to higher-air temperature in August. This resulted in the lowest NEE during the study period (-255.96.9 g C m(-2)). The highest seasonal net uptake (-336.56.3 g C m(-2)) was observed in 2013, which was linked to higher rainfall and temperature in July. Mean sea level was very similar during all 3years which allowed us to isolate the importance of climatic factors.

TI  - A synthesis of methane emissions from shallow vegetated coastal ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs; i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) play a critical role in global carbon (C) cycling, storing 10x more C than temperate forests. Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, can form in the sediments of these ecosystems. Currently, CH4 emissions are a missing component of VCE C budgets. This review summarizes 97 studies describing CH4 fluxes from mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass ecosystems and discusses factors controlling CH4 flux in these systems. CH4 fluxes from these ecosystems were highly variable yet they all act as net methane sources (median, range; mangrove: 279.17, -67.33 to 72,867.83; salt marsh: 224.44, -92.60 to 94,129.68; seagrass: 64.80, 1.25-401.50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). Together CH4 emissions from mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass ecosystems are about 0.33-0.39 Tmol CH4-C/year-an addition that increases the current global marine CH4 budget by more than 60%. The majority (~45%) of this increase is driven by mangrove CH4 fluxes. While organic matter content and quality were commonly reported in individual studies as the most important environmental factors driving CH4 flux, they were not significant predictors of CH4 flux when data were combined across studies. Salinity was negatively correlated with CH4 emissions from salt marshes, but not seagrasses and mangroves. Thus the available data suggest that other environmental drivers are important for predicting CH4 emissions in vegetated coastal systems. Finally, we examine stressor effects on CH4 emissions from VCEs and we hypothesize that future changes in temperature and other anthropogenic activites (e.g., nitrogen loading) will likely increase CH4 emissions from these ecosystems.

TI  - Diel and seasonal patterns of soil CO2 efflux in a temperate tidal marsh
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes store large amounts of carbon; however, little is known about the patterns, magnitudes, and biophysical drivers that regulate CO2 efflux from these ecosystems. Due to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., flooding), it is difficult to measure continuous soil CO2 efflux in tidal marshes. These data are necessary to inform empirical and process-based models and to better quantify carbon budgets. We performed automated (30 min) and manual (bi-monthly) soil CO2 efflux measurements, for -20 months, at two sites in a temperate tidal marsh: tall Spartina (TS; dominated by S. cynosuroides) and short Spartina (SS; dominated by S. alterniflora). These measurements were coupled with water quality, canopy spectral reflectance, and meteorological measurements. There were no consistent diel patterns of soil CO2 efflux, suggesting a decoupling of soil CO2 efflux with diel variations in temperature and tides (i.e., water level) showing a hysteresis effect. Mean soil CO2 efflux was significantly higher at SS (2.15 +/- 1.60 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) than at TS (0.55 +/- 0.80 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), highlighting distinct biogeochemical spatial variability. At the annual scale, air temperature explained >50% of the variability in soil CO2 efflux at both sites; and water level and salinity were secondary drivers of soil CO2 efflux at SS and TS, respectively. Annual soil CO2 efflux varied from 287-876 to 153-211 g C m(-2) y(-1) at SS and TS, respectively, but manual measurements underestimated the annual flux by <67% at SS and <23% at TS. These results suggest that measuring and modeling diel soil CO2 efflux variability in tidal marshes may be more challenging than previously expected and highlight large discrepancies between manual and automated soil CO2 efflux measurements. New technical approaches are needed to implement long-term automated measurements of soil CO2 efflux across wetlands to properly estimate the carbon balance of these ecosystems.

CL  - FRANCE
AB  - The effects of drought on salt marsh sediments from Sapelo Island, Georgia, were examined in flow-through reactor experiments. Three hydrological treatments were employed: a continuously flooded anoxic control, a periodic drought treatment that experienced alternate periods of flooding and drying, and a severe drought treatment, where sediment was exposed to drought (drying) for several weeks and then flooded; the effect of both buffered and non-buffered flooding solutions were examined. In permanently anoxic sediments as well as in sediments exposed to drought, organic carbon oxidation was dominated by SO4 (2-) reduction (SR) and SR rates increased over time. The shift from anoxic to oxic conditions in drought treatments significantly altered sediment geochemistry and pathways of microbial metabolism. Drought conditions favored suboxic mineralization processes, such as Fe(III) reduction and denitrification, which was fueled by NH4 (+) oxidation promoted by O-2 delivered during drought conditions. Other major drought-induced changes included pH decrease, and altered concentrations of solid phase adsorbed metals.

TI  - Will fluctuations in salt marsh-mangrove dominance alter vulnerability of a subtropical wetland to sea-level rise?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To avoid submergence during sea-level rise, coastal wetlands build soil surfaces vertically through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter. At climatic boundaries where mangroves are expanding and replacing salt marsh, wetland capacity to respond to sea-level rise may change. To compare how well mangroves and salt marshes accommodate sea-level rise, we conducted a manipulative field experiment in a subtropical plant community in the subsiding Mississippi River Delta. Experimental plots were established in spatially equivalent positions along creek banks in monospecific stands of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) or Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and in mixed stands containing both species. To examine the effect of disturbance on elevation dynamics, vegetation in half of the plots was subjected to freezing (mangrove) or wrack burial (salt marsh), which caused shoot mortality. Vertical soil development was monitored for 6 years with the surface elevation table-marker horizon system. Comparison of land movement with relative sea-level rise showed that this plant community was experiencing an elevation deficit (i.e., sea level was rising faster than the wetland was building vertically) and was relying on elevation capital (i.e., relative position in the tidal frame) to survive. Although Avicennia plots had more elevation capital, suggesting longer survival, than Spartina or mixed plots, vegetation type had no effect on rates of accretion, vertical movement in root and sub-root zones, or net elevation change. Thus, these salt marsh and mangrove assemblages were accreting sediment and building vertically at equivalent rates. Small-scale disturbance of the plant canopy also had no effect on elevation trajectoriescontrary to work in peat-forming wetlands showing elevation responses to changes in plant productivity. The findings indicate that in this deltaic setting with strong physical influences controlling elevation (sediment accretion, subsidence), mangrove replacement of salt marsh, with or without disturbance, will not necessarily alter vulnerability to sea-level rise.

TI  - Linking bacterioplankton community structures to environmental state variables and phytoplankton assemblages in two South Carolina salt marsh estuaries
T2  - AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microorganisms are among the most important organisms to the ecology of salt marsh estuaries; however, fundamental questions regarding their distribution, environmental controls, and interactions with phytoplankton remain unanswered. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of bacterial rRNA genes and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of phytoplankton photopigments to characterize planktonic communities from the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto (ACE) Basin and North Inlet (NI) estuaries on the South Carolina coast, USA. Multivariate comparisons of the planktonic community profiles revealed that the 2 estuaries supported distinct bacterial communities. Furthermore, bacterial communities in both systems were partitioned into separate particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) components. Differences in bacterial populations were also observed along the salinity gradient within each system. Comparisons of water physicochemistry with bacterial profiles indicated significant correlation of PA bacterial community structures with temperature, salinity, organic carbon, total phosphorus, and ammonium, whereas FL communities were affected by nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus and orthophosphate. PA bacterioplankton community structures were also associated with diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes and cryptophytes, while FL assemblages corresponded to prasinophytes, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria. Comparisons between estuaries further demonstrated that ACE Basin communities were mostly associated with the same pigments as PA samples, and that NI assemblages correlated with FL-associated phytoplankton, suggesting different trophodynamics of particles in the 2 systems.

TI  - Differences in photosynthetic syndromes of four halophytic marsh grasses in Pakistan
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-tolerant grasses of warm sub-tropical ecosystems differ in their distribution patterns with respect to salinity and moisture regimes. Experiments were conducted on CO2 fixation and light harvesting processes of four halophytic C-4 grasses grown under different levels of salinity (0, 200 and 400 mM NaCl) under ambient environmental conditions. Two species were from a high saline coastal marsh (Aeluropus lagopoides and Sporobolus tremulus) and two were from a moderate saline sub-coastal draw-down tidal marsh (Paspalum paspalodes and Paspalidium geminatum). Analyses of the carbon isotope ratios of leaf biomass in plants indicated that carbon assimilation was occurring by C-4 photosynthesis in all species during growth under varying levels of salinity. In the coastal species, with increasing salinity, there was a parallel decrease in rates of CO2 fixation (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g (s)), with no effect on water use efficiency (WUE). These species were adapted for photoprotection by an increase in the Mehler reaction with an increase in activity of PSII/CO2 fixed accompanied by high levels of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase. The sub-coastal species P. paspalodes and P. geminatum had high levels of carotenoid pigments and non-photochemical quenching by the xanthophyll cycle.

TI  - Diurnal Variations of Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Vertical Fluxes in a Subtropical Estuarine Marsh on Neap and Spring Tide Days
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is fundamental to estimating their impact on global warming. We examined diurnal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) vertical fluxes in a tidal marsh ecosystem. Measurements were recorded on neap and spring tide days in April and September 2010 in the Shanyutan wetland of the Min River estuary, southeast China. Here, we define a positive flux as directing into the atmosphere. CH4 fluxes on the diurnal scale were positive throughout, and CH4 emissions into the atmosphere on neap tide days were higher than on spring tide days. CH4 releases from the marsh ecosystem on neap tide days were higher in the daytime; however, on spring tide days, daily variations of CH4 emissions were more complex. The marsh ecosystem plays a twofold role in both releasing and assimilating CO2 and N2O gases on the diurnal scale. Average CO2 fluxes were positive on the daily scale both on neap and spring days and were greater on the neap tide days than on spring tide days. Diurnal variations of N2O fluxes fluctuated more. Over the diurnal period, soil temperature markedly controlled variations of CH4 emissions compared to other soil factors, such as salinity and redox potential. Tidal water height was a key factor influencing GHGs fluxes at the water-air interface. Compared with N2O, the diurnal course of CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the marsh ecosystem appeared to be directly controlled by marsh plants. These results have implications for sampling and scaling strategies for estimating GHGs fluxes in tidal marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This "blue carbon" in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30°C) for 161 days. Q10 of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0  0.1 and 2.2  0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ  mol-1 and 58.8 kJ  mol-1 for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90  2.81 Gg C  yr-1 is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

T2  - Revista de Biologia (Lisbon)
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mondego salt marsh is located in Figueira da Foz in the centre of Portugal. As in many other european estuaries, the discharges of industrial, urban and agricultural effluents are enhancing the eutrophication of this ecosystem. Spartina maritima is an abundant halophyte in the Mondego salt marsh where it plays a key role in nutrient recycling process and organic matter renovation. In order to understand N dynamics, NH4+, NO3- and total N, were monthly measured, in water, soil and in plants of Spartina maritima. Nitrogen losses were monthly quantified in dead leaves. NO3- was preferentially accumulated in leaves. Higher concentrations were observed in young leaves, with a maximum in summer (80 mumol.g-1). On the contrary, NH4+ was mainly accumulated in senescent leaves. Values varied between 0.5 mumol.g-1 and 12.6 mumol.g-1. Similar concentrations were found in roots, rhizomes and leaves. Total N, measured in leaves, was higher in younger leaves, from February to April (2 mmol.g-1), decreasing in the summer (0.5 mmol.g-1).

TI  - Changes in soils and vegetation in a Mediterranean coastal salt marsh impacted by human activities
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports changes in vegetation distribution and species cover in relation to soil factors and hydrology in a semiarid Mediterranean salt marsh adjacent to the Mar Menor saline lagoon. Species cover, soil salinity, and the groundwater level were monitored between 1991 and 1993 and between 2002 and 2004, and total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrates, ammonium and exchangeable phosphorus were measured in the soils in both study periods. In addition, three soil profiles were described in August 1992 and August 2004. The results indicate an elevation of the water table throughout the 13-year period, which was attributable to water flowing from areas with intensive agriculture. Flooding increased and soil salinity dropped in the most saline sites and increased in the least saline ones. The morphology of the soil profiles reflected the increase in flooding periods, clue to the appearance of a greyer matrix in the deeper horizons and a more diffuse pattern of Fe mottles. Following these environmental changes, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Phragmites australis and Juncus maritimus strongly expanded at the wettest sites, which led to the disappearance of the original zonation pattern. The cover of Limonium delicatulum, in turn, decreased with the increase in moisture but increased following the increase in salinity. Changes in soil nutrients were only very evident in the sandy soils of the beach, probably due to the influence of organic debris deposited on the shoreline by the storms and due to the strong increase in the colonisation of this habitat by perennial species. According to the results obtained, control measures are needed in order to preserve habitat diversity in this and other salt marshes of this area. Monitoring of the vegetation distribution could be a useful tool to identify environmental impacts, in order to implement remedial actions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trends of soil organic matter turnover in the salt marsh of the Yangtze River estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Characteristics and tidal flat trends of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover were studied for the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, based on analyses of stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), grain sizes and contents of particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen (TN) and inorganic carbon (TIC) for three cores excavated from high tidal flat, middle tidal flat and bare flat. Results demonstrate that correlations between soil POC contents and delta C-13 values of the salt marsh cores were similar to those between soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and delta C-13 values of the upper soil layers of mountainous soil profiles with different altitudes. SOM of salt marsh was generally younger than 100 years, and originated mainly from topsoil erosions in catchments of the Yangtze River. Correlations of TN content with C/N ratio, POC content with TIC content and POC content with delta C-13 values for the cores suggest that turnover degrees of SOM from the salt marsh are overall low, and trends of SOM turnover are clear from the bare flat to the high tidal flat. Bare flat samples show characteristics of original sediments, with minor SOM turnover. Turnover processes of SOM have occurred and are discernable in the high and middle tidal flats, and the mixing degrees of SOM compartments with different turnover rates increase with evolution of the muddy tidal flat. The exclusive strata structure of alternate muddy laminae and silty laminae originated from dynamic depositional processes on muddy tidal flat was a great obstacle to vertical migration of dissolved materials, and SOM turnover was then constrained. The muddy tidal flat processes exerted direct influences on sequestration and turnover of SOM in the salt marsh, and had great constraints on the spatial and temporal characteristics of SOM turnover of the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary.

TI  - Coring and compaction: Best practice in blue carbon stock and burial estimations
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparison of gouge and hammer coring techniques in intertidal wetland soils highlights a significant effect of soil compaction of up to 28% associated with the widely applied hammer coring method employed in Blue Carbon research. Hammer coring reduces the thickness of the soil profile and increases the dry bulk density, which results in an overestimation of the soil OC stock of up to 22%. In saltmarshes with multiple different soil units, we show that hammer coring is unsuitable for the calculation of OC stocks and should be avoided in favour of Russian or gouge cores. Compaction changes both soil dry bulk density and porosity and we show that resultant radiometric chronologies are compromised, almost doubling mass accumulation rates. While we show that the OC (%) content of these sediments is largely unchanged by coring method, the implication for OC burial rates are profound because of the significant effect of hammer coring on the calculation of soil mass accumlation rates.

TI  - Evaluating Tidal Marsh Sustainability in the Face of Sea-Level Rise: A Hybrid Modeling Approach Applied to San Francisco Bay
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tidal marshes will be threatened by increasing rates of sea-level rise (SLR) over the next century. Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities.Methodology: Building upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and SLR assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios.Principal Findings: Model results indicated that under a high rate of SLR (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (-0.2 m MHHW) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on SLR and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats.Conclusions/Significance: Results suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-SLR scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas. To assist land managers, we developed a web-based decision support tool (www.prbo.org/sfbayslr).

TI  - ASSIMILATION OF HYDROPHOBIC CHLORINATED ORGANICS IN FRESH-WATER WETLANDS - SORPTION AND SEDIMENT WATER EXCHANGE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In laboratory studies, sorption of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in wetland soil and floodwater was strongly influenced by high levels of naturally-occurring dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Organic matter-dominated wetlands (e.g., marshes) containing high concentrations of DOC demonstrated no advantage over mineral-dominated wetlands (e.g., bottomland hardwood forests) for sorption of HCB due to partitioning in this DOC phase. Sorption of HCB was described adequately using a three-phase model that included the DOC phase. However, partition coefficients in the bottomland hardwood soil were time-dependent. This time-dependent phenomena was not observed in the freshwater marsh soil. Sorptive assimilation of organic compounds in wetlands appears to be dependent on the unique hydrological conditions that promote sediment-water exchange and accretion rather than any enhanced sorptive ability of wetland soils themselves.

TI  - Drought-induced variability in dissolved organic matter composition in a marsh-dominated estuary
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an estuary characterized by extensive salt marsh vegetation was investigated at the molecular level using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and stable carbon isotope analyses. Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.

TI  - Recovery of Salt Marsh Invertebrates Following Habitat Restoration: Implications for Marsh Restoration in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recovery following salt marsh restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico is investigated using meta-analysis for two salt marsh indicator invertebrates, the periwinkle snail (Littoraria irrorata) and amphipod crustaceans (Amphipoda). These invertebrates serve key marsh ecosystem functions including facilitating nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger ecologically and economically important species. Recovery of periwinkles in restored marshes compared to reference sites is quantified by progression in population density and, because the species is long-lived (~ 10 years), in terms of biomass added per unit area each year following restoration. Amphipods are shorter-lived with high annual turnover; thus, recovery through time is estimated by the density of individuals rather than by biomass. The results of the analyses indicate progressive periwinkle recovery to equivalence with reference systems by year 4 in terms of density and year 6 with respect to annual biomass addition, while amphipod densities do not fully recover in the first 20 years following restoration. Although periwinkle recovery in terms of annual biomass addition reaches equivalence by year 6, the development of an age class structure characteristic of reference marshes would likely take longer because of the relatively long lifespan for this species. In addition to providing insight into the benefits of salt marsh restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the approach described can be applied more generally to restoration scaling in a natural resource damage assessment context.

TI  - The role of two Spartina species in phytostabilization and bioaccumulation of Co, Cr, and Ni in the Tinto-Odiel estuary (SW Spain)
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vascular plants in salt marshes strongly influence processes of heavy metal accumulation. Many studies have focused on this issue; however, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of plants on the distribution of certain poorly studied metals, such as Co, Cr, and Ni. The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the capability of Spartina densiflora Brongn. and Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald, to accumulate Co, Cr, and Ni and influence the sediment composition around their roots, investigating whether the observed behavior can change with different levels of sediment pollution. Concentrations of Co, Cr, and Ni were determined in tissues of S. densiflora and S. maritima and in sediments and rhizosediments from the Odiel and Tinto marshes (SW Spain), one of the estuaries most polluted by heavy metals in the world. Concentrations of Co, Cr, and Ni in the belowground tissues of both Spartina species were higher than those in aboveground tissues in all sites sampled. Both species showed potential for phytostabilization of Co, possibly by promoting the formation of high amounts of Fe-oxides in the rhizosphere, which can act to retain the metal within the sediment around the roots. In addition, both Spartina species were found to accumulate Co in their roots, thereby avoiding the translocation of this metal to photosynthetic tissues. At the Tinto marsh, there were no differences recorded in metal levels between sediments and rhizosediments of both species, a fact that could be explained by the extremely high background levels of metals at this site, which may impair the ability of the plant to alter the chemistry of the sediment in contact with the roots. The potential for the immobilization of a large amount of Co in the soil, exhibited by S. densiflora and S. maritima, indicates that both species could be highly useful in the phytostabilization of Co contaminated environments.

TI  - Microclimate and substrate quality controls on nitrogen mineralization in a New England high salt marsh
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - New England high salt marsh primary productivity is limited by N, but variation in plant N availability across salt marsh vegetation zones has not been quantified. To investigate this, we measured in situ net N mineralization rates throughout the growing season in three zones of a Maine high salt marsh, Juncus gerardii, Spartina patens, and mixed perennial forb. We also measured microclimate factors ( soil temperatures and moistures) and substrate quality parameters ( soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil C: N ratio) to see if either related to differences in net N mineralization. To determine the relative importance of substrate quality and microclimate, we measured N mineralization of the different soil types in the laboratory, holding microclimate parameters constant. We also investigated the relative importance of microclimate and substrate statistically, with principal components analysis and multiple regression. In situ net N mineralization rates were significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but graminoid zone N mineralization rates did not vary significantly from each other. Soil temperatures, moistures, carbon, and nitrogen were all significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but C: N ratio did not vary significantly across zones. Principal components analysis and multiple regression revealed that microclimate was a more significant predictor of total N mineralized over the course of the growing season than was substrate quality. In contrast, when microclimate conditions were held constant, forb zone N mineralization was still significantly higher than that of graminoid zones, suggesting that substrate quality does exert some control on this process. Thus, both microclimate and substrate quality appear to influence N mineralization rates across vegetation zones of this Maine salt marsh.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses to salinity of the salt-marsh shrub Atriplex portulacoides
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims Atriplex (Halimione) portulacoides is a halophytic, C-3 shrub. It is virtually confined to coastal salt marshes, where it often dominates the vegetation. The aim of this study was to investigate its growth responses to salinity and the extent to which these could be explained by photosynthetic physiology.Methods The responses of young plants to salinity in the range 0-700 mol m(-3) NaCl were investigated in a glasshouse experiment. The performance of plants was examined using classical growth analysis, measurements of gas exchange (infrared gas analysis), determination of chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics (modulated fluorimeter) and photosynthetic pigment concentrations; total ash, sodium, potassium and nitrogen concentrations, and relative water content were also determined.Key Results Plants accumulated Na+ approximately in proportion to external salinity. Salt stimulated growth up to an external concentration of 200 mol m(-3) NaCl and some growth was maintained at higher salinities. The main determinant of growth response to salinity was unit leaf rate. This was itself reflected in rates Of CO2 assimilation, which were not affected by 200 mol m-3 but were reduced at higher salinities. Reductions in net photosynthetic rate could be accounted for largely by lower stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration. Apart from possible effects of osmotic shock at the beginning of the experiment, salinity did not have any adverse effect on photosystem II (PSII). Neither the quantum efficiency of PSII (Phi(PSU)) nor the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-m) were reduced by salinity, and lower mid-day values recovered by dawn. Mid-day F-v/F-m, was in fact depressed more at low external sodium concentration, by the end of the experiment.Conclusions The growth responses of the hygro-halophyte A. portulacoides to salinity appear largely to depend on changes in its rate of photosynthetic gas exchange. Photosynthesis appears to be limited mainly through stomatal conductance and hence intercellular CO2 concentration, rather than by effects on PSII; moderate salinity might stimulate carboxylation capacity. This is in contrast to more extreme halophytes, for which an ability to maintain leaf area can partially offset declining rates of carbon assimilation at high salinity.

TI  - Rapid colonization of degraded mangrove habitat by succulent salt marsh
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term closure of the Kobonqaba Estuary mouth to the sea resulted in high water levels, inundation of pneumatophores and die-back of the mangroves specifically, Avicennia marina. The recovery of the mangroves was measured by assessing changes in vegetation cover and sediment characteristics along transects and all mangroves present in the estuary were described in terms of height, diameter at breast height and phenology. Measurements were made in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. Surviving adult trees were producing propagules and showed that the forest would be able to regenerate if the seedlings established and were able to survive the environmental conditions. However there may be competition from salt marsh plants which increased in average cover from 0% in 2011 to 18.9% (2013) and 50% in 2015. Sediment characteristics changed over the study period with more oxic conditions in 2013 and 2015 (57.6 and 62.3 mV) compared to 2011 and 2012 (-189 to -148 mV) and organic matter decreased from 18.4% in 2011 to 9.8% in 2015. High initial porewater nutrient concentrations in 2013 promoted salt marsh growth. A particular sequence of events was recorded for the establishment of salt marsh in this previous mangrove habitat where stabilization of sediment by microphytobenthos and macroalgae was the key to further colonization by emergent macrophytes.

TI  - Salt Marshes Buffer El Nino Effects on Benthic Secondary Production
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences climate and hydrology on the planet and may drive the structure and functioning of estuarine communities. However, the effects of the ENSO on coastal areas are dependent on the spatial scale and the intrinsic characteristics of the estuary. Over six years (2013 to 2018), we investigated the variability in macrobenthic secondary production of Spartina alterniflora marshes and adjacent unvegetated areas in a subtropical coastal lagoon in Southern Brazil. We tested whether the ENSO events affect the benthic secondary production of these two habitats. Most environmental variables (air temperature, northward surface stress and northward wind component) did not differ significantly between ENSO phases, except for precipitation. Monthly precipitation totals during El Nino months were 70% higher than neutral and La Nina conditions. A total of 25,862 organisms (8,191 in salt marshes and 17,671 in unvegetated areas) belonging to 39 taxa (25 in marshes and 34 unvegetated areas) were collected throughout the study. The tanaid Monokalliapseudes schubarti, and Nereididae polychaeta Laeonereis acuta were largely the most abundant species in both vegetated and unvegetated areas, with higher biomass and productivity. The secondary production in unvegetated areas increased 216%, from a mean of 107.5 g C/m(2)/y to 336.4 g C/m(2)/y during El Nino. However, the salt marshes responded differently than the unvegetated areas, with secondary production more stable over the time, with highest value of 164.2 g C/m(2)/y-(1). There is also a distinction in the effects on different species, L. acuta showed an increase only in biomass (from 0.024 to 0.042 g DW/0.03m(2)), whereas M. schubarti increased both in biomass (more than 4000%) and density (more than 5000%). In contrast, no significant differences in density, biomass and secondary production for both species were detected over time in the salt marshes. Our findings indicate that large scale climatic variations, such as ENSO, can strongly affect estuarine density, biomass and secondary production, but salt marshes buffer El Nino effects on benthic associations.

TI  - Microbial activities and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization in the rhizosphere of the salt marsh plant Inula crithmoides L. along a spatial salinity gradient
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in a Mediterranean salt marsh in semiarid Southeast Spain to assess whether a spatial salinity gradient can affect the microbiological and biochemical properties (labile C fractions, biomass C, oxidoreductases, and hydrolases) of the rhizosphere soil of Inula crithmoides and the extent of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization in its roots. There were no significant differences in the soluble C fractions (water-soluble C and water-soluble carbohydrates) or the microbial biomass C values of the rhizosphere soil of L crithmoides among the different zones of the salt marsh. Dehydrogenase activity, hydrolases (urease, protease, phosphatase, and beta-glucosidase) and the extent of AM colonization in I. crithmoides roots were greater in the higher salt marsh zones, corresponding to those of lower rhizosphere soil salinity. This study shows that soil salinity is inversely associated with some parameters related to soil microbial activity, such as dehydrogenase activity and some hydrolases, as well as the extent of colonization by AM fungi, which can improve plant performance. However, bioactive organic matter fractions that determine soil productivity are not related to soil salinity.

TI  - Shallow Salt Marsh Tidal Ponds An Environment With Extreme Oxygen Dynamics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In marshes, tidal ponds are increasing in number and areal coverage. Getting a better understanding of their unique biogeochemistry is a prerequisite for foreseeing their future role in salt marsh ecosystems. Using in situ microprofiling, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of O-2, pH, and CO2 in shallow salt marsh tidal ponds in the summer time. High benthic photosynthetic activity, fueled by CO2 from the sediment, resulted in steep vertical O-2 gradients at the sediment-water interface, increasing from anoxia to extremely supersaturated peak concentrations up to 886 +/- 139 mu mol L-1 (391% atmospheric O-2 saturation) over a short distance of 6 mm. These characteristic peaks developed even at low light conditions down to 150 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The oxygen gradients were restricted to the layer of benthic microalgae on the sediment surface and did not extend into the water column, which was well-mixed throughout the day showing no vertical variation. The benthic photosynthesis and respiration controlled the oxygen concentration in the water column, creating net supersaturated conditions during the day and hypoxic conditions at night. The tidal ponds were generally well-buffered showing only attenuated pH fluctuations ranging from 6.2 to 7.3, and no persistent gradients built up, despite the high photosynthetic activity at the sediment water interface. CO2 accumulated in the sediment and was present in the water column during the morning hours, but depleted in the afternoon due to the high photosynthetic uptake. Tidal ponds also experienced event-driven changes in their biogeochemistry. Sea foam developed on the water surface during the day and accumulated on one side of the pond blocking light penetration and lowering oxygen concentrations under the foam. Inundation at high tide caused a short-lived temporal variation in O-2 and pH, which was restricted to the time of the flood. As the flooding water receded, the preceding O-2 and pH conditions were immediately restored. Altogether shallow tidal ponds comprise a marsh habitat with distinctive spatiotemporal oxygen dynamics driven by benthic photosynthesis and respiration, which differ from the surrounding vegetated marsh, and could drive changes in salt marsh biogeochemistry in response to increased pond coverage.

TI  - Clonal integration and the expansion of Phragmites australis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent expansion of the reed Phragmites australis in western Atlantic salt marshes has become a conservation concern. Historically, Phragmites was restricted to the terrestrial border of marshes, but now it aggressively invades lower elevations. To explore factors influencing this expansion, we examined (1) the effects of physical factors and competitive interactions on the performance of Phragmites and (2) the role of clonal integration on the ability of Phragmites to invade low marsh habitats.We transplanted Phragmites into vegetation along an elevation gradient, with and without neighboring plants. Phragmites died when transplanted to the lowest marsh zone but survived and expanded in higher marsh zones. This suggests that the low oxygen availability characteristic of waterlogged soils limits Phragmites growth in the low marsh. Neighboring vegetation reduced Phragmites growth in all zones, and severing Phragmites rhizomes invading the low marsh reduced the survivorship and photosynthetic rate of ramets.These results suggest that Phragmites may invade low marsh habitats by initially establishing itself in the high marsh and then expanding into lower, less favorable habitats using clonal integration. This has important implications for understanding the changing dynamics of New England salt marsh plant communities and developing management strategies for the control of Phragmites.

TI  - Influence of tidal regime, diurnal phase, habitat and season on feeding of an intertidal crab
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between diet and feeding activity of intertidal crabs, and environmental cycles (tidal, daily and seasonal), habitat and level of the intertidal zone (high/low) was studied using Neohelice granulata (Brachyura, Varunidae) as a model. This is a semi-terrestrial burrowing crab occupying different habitats in the Southwestern Atlantic coasts and estuaries from bare low intertidal mudflats to high intertidal salt marshes, and from fine, organic matter rich sediment to very coarse sediment with low content of organic matter. The study was carried out in two contrasting habitats of three sites with diverse sets of physical and biological conditions. Diet and feeding of adult N. granulata were indirectly studied through the proportion of food items and the presence/absence of food in crab stomachs, respectively. This species has a dual mode of feeding: predominantly herbivorous (live plants or plant litter in salt marshes) or deposit feeder (superficial sediment and detritus in mudflats), but the quantity and quality of ingested food varies among habitats and sites. A trend to omnivory (including algae and conspecifics) was detected in relation to low quality of resources. Feeding activity modulated by a complex interaction of factors varied according to spatial and/or temporal changes in some natural cycles. Males and non-ovigerous females fed preferably after dark and during submersion periods, but also after emersion periods if mudflat sediment remained wet; salt marsh crab feeding is somewhat independent of light and tidal cycles. Ovigerous females almost never fed. Both diet and feeding activity of this crab seem to be flexible traits adapted to different combinations of physical and biological factors.

TI  - On the wisdom of calculating annual material budgets in tidal wetlands
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, measurements of the tidal exchange of inorganic and organic materials, and their extrapolation for the calculation of annual budgets, have played an important role in assessing the ecological functioning and sedimentary status of coastal wetlands. Flux measurements, and their application to longer sequences of tidal flooding, for an enclosed back-barrier salt marsh in Norfolk, England, show how net import/export characteristics for a range of materials (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon), and thus the interpretation of wetland function, are strongly dependent upon the method of budgetary calculation. Annual budgets should be evaluated in a broader context which explores differing combinations of flooding regime, sediment supply and surface accretion, and vegetation production and decay.

TI  - Recent environmental evolution of regenerated salt marshes in the southern Bay of Biscay: Anthropogenic evidences in their sedimentary record
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Short sediment cores (up to 44 cm long) taken from salt marshes regenerated during the last 60 years in the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve have been interpreted on the basis of microfaunal and geochemical determinations and historical data. Agricultural soils in the middle and upper estuary reaches were abandoned during the 1950s and entrance of estuarine water provoked a rapid natural environmental transformation of these anthropogenic areas. Increasing amounts of sand and benthic foraminifera were deposited at a very high sedimentation rate (average 16 mm yr(-1)) during the 1950s and 1960s allowing well developed regenerated salt marshes to be rapidly established in these formerly occupied areas. During recent decades much lower sedimentation rates (average 2.5 mm yr(-1)), abundant agglutinated foraminiferal assemblages and enrichment of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cr) due to industrialization are characteristic of these already regenerated environments. This rapid regeneration process (less than 10 years) is of great interest for environmental management of modern coastal zones where extensive reclaimed land could be easily restored to tidal wetlands under the current scenario of accelerating sea-level rise.

TI  - Marsh Processes and Their Response to Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 47
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In addition to their being vital components of mid-to high-latitude coastal ecosystems, salt marshes contain 0.1% of global sequestered terrestrial carbon. Their sustainability is now threatened by accelerating sea-level rise (SLR) that has reached a rate that is many times greater than the rate at which they formed and evolved. Modeling studies have been instrumental in predicting how marsh systems will respond to greater frequencies and durations of tidal inundation and in quantifying thresholds when marshes will succumb and begin to disintegrate due to accelerating SLR. Over the short term, some researchers believe that biogeomorphic feedbacks will improve marsh survival through greater biomass productivity enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Increased sedimentation rates are less likely due to lower-than-expected suspended sediment concentrations. The majority of marsh loss today is through wave-induced edge erosion that beneficially adds sediment to the system. Edge erosion is partly offset by upland marsh migration during SLR.Despite positive biogeomorphic feedbacks, many salt marshes will succumb to accelerating sea-level rise due to insufficient mineral sediment.The latest multivariate marsh modeling is producing predictions of marsh evolution under various sea-level rise scenarios.The least well-known variables in projecting changes to salt marshes are suspended sediment concentrations and net sediment influx to the marsh.We are in the infancy of understanding the importance and processes of marsh edge erosion and the overall dynamicism of marshes.This review defines the latest breakthroughs in understanding the response of salt marshes to accelerating sea-level rise and decreasing sediment supply.Climate change is accelerating sea-level rise, warming temperatures, and increasing carbon dioxide, all of which are impacting marsh vegetation and vertical accretion.

TI  - A stem-boring moth drives detritus production in SW Atlantic marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Boundary habitats are frequently hot spots for the production and flow of organic matter (OM) and exert strong effects on ecological processes in the habitats which they link. Salt marshes, which are boundary habitats occurring between the land and the sea, are important sources of OM for coastal habitats. Primary productivity and tides are among the main causes of OM production and export from salt marshes. By field sampling and experiments we found that the stem-boring moth Haimbachia sp. nov. substantially increases the production of detritus in salt marshes along the SW Atlantic coastline. The larvae of this moth enhance the natural mortality of Spartina alterniflora and S. densiflora by feeding inside the basal and middle portions of the stem tissue. The attacks of the moth larvae produce dead and debilitated stems that are more easily broken and transported by the tides than non-attacked stems. Because the moth-attack frequencies will vary geographically in response to variation in the physical environment, the amount of OM flow between habitats will also vary, resulting in a positive relationship between moth-attack frequencies and OM production on a regional scale. Our field and experimental results show that herbivory by this moth and tidal transport could be the main determinants of the production of Spartina macrodetritus in these marshes. A key finding based on this previously undescribed interaction is that biological interactions (i.e. the effects of herbivores) can change the permeability of boundary habitats by altering the OM flow between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Indirect Human Impacts Reverse Centuries of Carbon Sequestration and Salt Marsh Accretion
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

TI  - High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Neponset River Estuary, Boston Harbor, MA
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Neponset River Estuary is a small, tidally dominated urban system that is fringed with Spartina spp. salt marsh and drains the second largest river into Boston Harbor, MA, High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were taken with a towed instrument package, the MiniShuttle, to explore tidal and seasonal variations in the sources and distributions of CDOM in the estuary. A mid-estuary source of CDOM was apparent on all surveys representing 10-50% of the freshwater CDOM source to the system. Presumably this source results from the degradation of salt marsh derived organic matter within the estuary. The strength of this source peaked in late summer, an observation that is consistent with this interpretation. Two-dimensional (tow-yo) data shows that the constricting Granite Avenue Bridge displays a major influence on circulation in the estuary. Further, large-scale tidal mixing and variations in the freshwater endmember on the time scale of hours make interpretations difficult. High-resolution measurements show that a fluctuating freshwater endmember and a constant CDOM source from the fringing salt marsh during August, 2002 are consistent with observations.

TI  - Effects of drying and wetting cycles induced by tides on net ecosystem exchange of CO2 over a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - As a unique hydrological characteristic , the tidal action can strongly affect carbon balance in a salt marsh despite their short duration. Using the eddy covariance technique, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange ( NEE) and its environmental factors and tidal change over a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta. It aimed to investigate the effect of tidal process and drying and wetting cycles induced by tides on NEE. The results showed that the tidal process promoted the daytime CO2 uptake, but it didn't clearly affect the nighttime CO2 release. Tidal inundation was a major factor influencing daytime NEE. The diurnal change of NEE showed a distinct U-shaped curve on both drought and wet stages, but not with substantial variation in its amplitude during the drought stage. The drying and wetting cycles enhanced the absorption of daytime CO2 . Under drought stage , the mean of the maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max) ) , apparent quantum yield (alpha) and ecosystem respiration (R-cco) were higher than those in wet stage. In addition, the drying and wetting cycles suppressed the nighttime CO2 release from the salt marsh but increased its temperature sensitivity.

TI  - Is bacterioplankton production in the Ria de Aveiro influenced by salt marshes and bed sediment?
T2  - Aquatic Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of potential export of materials from bottom sediments and salt marshes into the water column of a shallow estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro to the observed high bacterial productivity in the mid section of this estuary was evaluated. Vertical profiles of physical, chemical and bacterial variables were studied in the marine and brackish water zones, and of transversal profiles in the brackish zone only. Although the concentrations of seston (17-241 mg l-1), particulate organic carbon (3-15.5 mg l-1) and chlorophyll (1.2-7.0 mug l-1) varied widely, the vertical and transversal profiles were without much variation. Total bacterial number (0.2-8.5X109 cells l-1) and the number of particle-attached bacteria (0.02-2.50X109 cells l-1) along vertical and transversal profiles did not differ much, but the rate of bacterial production (0.05-14.2 mug C l-1 h-1) and dissolved organic carbon concentration (6.0-69.2 mg l-1) were frequently higher near the salt marsh margin at the brackish water transect. The increase in productivity could not be associated with runoff of particulate matter but coincided with the inputs of dissolved organic carbon. The results of vertical and transversal profiles point to a minor role of particulate matter additions from the salt marsh area or from bed sediments.

TI  - Tracing mercury seawater vs. atmospheric inputs in a pristine SE USA salt marsh system: Mercury isotope evidence
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes can be a significant source of MeHg in coastal marine organisms, however the sources and cycling of Hg in salt marsh sediments, and in coastal environments in general, remain unclear. We analyzed surface and cored sediments from a salt marsh and adjacent upland sand dune in Cabretta Island, Georgia, USA, for total mercury (Hg-T), Hg isotopes and trace metal concentrations to better constrain the sources of Hg in this coastal environment. Hg-T concentrations are lower in the upland sands (1-6 ng/g) than in the marsh sediments (6-16 ng/g). Hg-T shows a positive correlation with total organic content (TOC) and increasing proportion of fines in the sediments. Trace metal concentrations also show a positive correlation with Hg-T in the marsh sediments regardless of chemical affinity (i.e. chalcophile, siderophile or lithophile). All these data are consistent with surface adsorption (either directly on to sediments or on to organic matter) as a dominant mechanism of Hg and metals accumulation in the marsh sediments. The surface sediments show significant mass independent fractionation (MIF) of odd Hg isotopes: the upland dune sands have zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199 (-0.07 parts per thousand to -0.14 parts per thousand) and the marsh surface sediments have positive Delta Hg-199 (0.48 parts per thousand to 0.79 parts per thousand). As in the surface samples, well-sorted sand layers in the cored sediments have low Hg concentrations and zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199, whereas fine particle-rich layers have higher Hg concentrations and positive Delta Hg-199 values. In the absence of any evidence for MIF of Hg isotopes by bacteria mediated methylation-demethylation reactions, the observed Hg isotope differences between marsh and upland sands can be explained by different sources of Hg. We suggest that local atmospheric Hg deposition dominates the Hg budget in the ombrotrophic upland sand, while the positive MIF in the marsh sediments are consistent with Hg dominantly of seawater origin. While in situ processes, like photoreduction and evasion can overprint the Hg depositional isotope signature, their effect on the sediments is currently unconstrained. Nevertheless, our data show that Hg isotopes can delineate different sources of Hg in a pristine coastal environment and at small spatial scales. Thus natural background isotope variability should be assessed as a baseline when Hg isotopes are used as tracers of Hg in anthropogenically-influenced sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Short-term responses to salinity of an invasive cordgrass
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity is one of the main chemical factors in salt marshes. Studies focused on the analysis of salinity tolerance of salt marsh plants are very important, since they may help to relate their physiological tolerances with distribution limits in the field. Spartina densiflora is a South America cordgrass, which has started its invasion of the European coastline from the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. In this work, short-term responses in adult tussocks of S. densiflora from southwestern Spain are studied over a wide range of salinity in a greenhouse experiment. Our results point out that S. densiflora has a high tolerance to salinity, showing high growth and net photosynthesis rates from 0.5 to 20 ppt. S. dens flora showed at the lowest salinity (0.5 ppt) high levels of photoinhibition, compensated by higher levels of energy transmission between photosystems. Adaptative mechanisms, as those described previously, would allow it to live in fresh water environments. At the highest salinity (40 ppt), S. densiflora showed a high stress level, reflected in significant decreases in growth, net photosynthesis rate and photochemical efficiency of Photosystem II. These responses support S. dens flora invasion patterns in European estuaries, with low expansion rates along the coastline and faster colonization of brackish marshes and river banks.

TI  - Microbial strategies in non-target invasive Spartina densiflora for heavy metal clean up in polluted saltmarshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rhizoremediation is the use of microorganisms from the rhizosphere to assist plant phytoremediation. Optimistic results have been obtained these years for this biotool, but its effects in non-target cohabiting species has never been studied. This concern, in principle pointless, gains importance when the non-target species is an invasive plant. It is the case of highly polluted saltmarshes in SW Spain, where the native cordgrass Spartina maritima, proposed for heavy metal rhizoremediation, cohabitates with the invasive Spartina densiflora. In this work, we designed a greenhouse experiment where S. densiflora was placed in pots with natural metal polluted soil from Tinto marsh and inoculated with a bacterial consortium designed for rhizoremediation purposes with S. maritima. After 30 days of treatment, our data revealed that inoculated S. densiflora showed better fitness and metal accumulation capacity than non-inoculated control plants. This enhancement was demonstrated by increased S. densiflora biomass (58% for belowground tissues), amelioration of photosynthetic parameters (i.e., 48% for net photosynthetic rate (A(N)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) and 17% for intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE)), and finally by an increase of inoculated S. densiflora root metal uptake, reaching around 40% in case of cadmium and lead. Within this scenario, the rhizoremediation strategy proposed using S. maritima should be managed cautiously, and if would be entitled to determine to which extent its practical implementation may boost invasive capability of S. densiflora.

T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenolic oxidation products of lignin and neutral monosaccharides and amino acids released by acid hydrolysis were determined for samples of living and dead Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.), surficial marsh sediment, and the fulvic and humic acids isolated from these source materials, which were collected in a Georgia salt marsh estuary. Humic acids from all sources showed marked similarities in all of the parameters measured and closely resembled the source materials. Fulvic acid, while similar as a group, differed significantly from both the humic acids and the source material. Fungal decomposition of the plants, which is dominant to bacterial decomposition while the plants remain standing in the marsh, selectively degrades polysaccharides rather than indiscriminantly decomposing both lignin and polysaccharide biopolymers. The measured phenols, monosaccharides and amino acids accounted for 50-70% of the total carbon in the fulvic acids and 19-37% of the carbon in humic acids. Amino acids were estimated to account for 35-60% of fulvic acid nitrogen and 15-35% of humic acid nitrogen. There was no evidence that physiological state of the plants altered the intrinsic organic structure of either the fulvic or humic acids.

TI  - Effect of cadmium on reductive dechlorination of trichloroaniline
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of a transition metal, cadmium (Cd), on reductive dechlorination of a model chlorinated organic, 2,3,4-trichloroaniline (2,3,4-TCA), was determined in the laboratory in three anaerobic, hooded soils with varying properties. Dechlorination of 2,3,4-TCA was inhibited over a continuum of pore-water-soluble Cd concentrations (10-200 mu g/L) in mineral-dominated rice paddy and bottomland hardwood soils. In organic-dominated marsh soil, however, a critical inhibitory level of pore-water-soluble Cd (200 mu g/L) was observed. Lower-chlorinated aniline metabolites differed with soluble Cd concentration. Different metabolites (2,3-dichloroaniline and 2-chloroaniline) were observed in some soils as Cd neared the completely inhibitory concentration. Speciation of soluble Cd was necessary to predict whether inhibition would occur, particularly in the presence of high concentrations of organic ligands such as humic acids. Selective extractions and measurement of acid-volatile sulfides provided additional information but did not adequately predict inhibition of dechlorination. These results demonstrate the importance of quantification and speciation of pore-water metal concentrations in predicting potential inhibition of anaerobic biodegradation reactions such as reductive dechlorination.

TI  - Quantifying the trophic base for benthic secondary production in the Nakdong River estuary of Korea using stable C and N isotopes
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall dependence of benthic secondary production on the main primary producers at three different habitats in the Nakdong River estuarine system, Korea, was estimated. Inventories of macrobenthic invertebrate biomass were combined with multiple-isotope-mixing models to evaluate the trophic base, comparing Scirpus triqueter-dominated and Phragmites australis-dominated marshes and bare intertidal flat. The feasible contributions of four main food sources, marsh macrophytes, the microphytobenthos, and riverine and marine suspended particulate organic matter (RPOM and MPOM), to the consumer biomasses were calculated using the isotopic mixing model. After weighting the feasible contributions of food sources to each taxon by the consumer biomass, the resultant values were summed for all the consumers at each habitat to quantify the trophic base of the benthic invertebrate community. Dual-isotope-mixing model calculations verified the varying dependence on those potential food sources among the functional feeding groups. In addition, the dependence on each source of the same functional group varied between bare intertidal and salt-marsh habitats, shifting from a dominance of benthic and pelagic microalgal sources on the former habitat to a mixed food source at the latter habitat. The biomasses of the species comprising each functional group differed among habitats and sampling dates, so that each functional group made a different contribution to the whole benthic community and its basal food source. Given the calculation of the overall dependence of macrozoobenthic community on each food source, our results indicate that the microphytobenthic source dominates (nearly half) the trophic base in all the intertidal habitats of different vegetational compositions. Marsh-macrophyte-derived organic matter and RPOM served as considerable subsidies only to salt-marsh food webs, reflecting the use of the mixed food source by salt-marsh-bed consumers. Conversely, the dominance of MPOM in the total food base was equal to that of the microphytobenthos in the bare intertidal ecosystem but increased during spring-summer in the salt-marsh systems. Our results also suggest that the river discharge concentrated during the summer monsoon does not lead to any shift in trophic base for estuarine secondary production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Life history strategies of Estuarine Nekton: The role of marsh macrophytes, benthic microalgae, and phytoplankton in the trophic spectrum
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The stable isotope signatures of marine transient and resident nekton were used to investigate trophic linkages between primary producers, marsh macrophytes, phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, and consumers within the Delaware Bay. A whole estuary approach was used to compare the flux of nutrients from primary producers to juvenile weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), and white perch (Morone americana) in open waters of the lower and upper Bay and adjacent salt marshes dominated by either Spartina alterniflora or Phragmites australis. Our results suggest that trophic linkages vary significantly along the salinity gradient, reflecting the transition from Spartina to Phragmites-dominated marshes, and secondarily, in a marsh to open water (offshore) direction at a given salinity. Superimposed on this pattern was a gradient in the proximate use of organic matter that depended on life history traits of each species ranging from pelagic to benthic in the order bay anchovy > weakfish > white perch.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes reflect plant zonation and belowground biomass in a coastal marsh
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are major global carbon sinks; however, they are heterogeneous and dynamic ecosystems. To characterize spatial and temporal variability in a New England salt marsh, greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes were compared among major plant-defined zones during growing seasons. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were compared in two mensurative experiments during summer months (2012-2014) that included low marsh (Spartina alterniflora), high marsh (Distichlis spicata and Juncus gerardii-dominated), invasive Phragmites australis zones, and unvegetated ponds. Day-and nighttime fluxes were also contrasted in the native marsh zones. N2O fluxes were measured in parallel with CO2 and CH4 fluxes, but were not found to be significant. To test the relationships of CO2 and CH4 fluxes with several native plant metrics, a multivariate nonlinear model was used. Invasive P. australis zones (-7 to -15 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) and S. alterniflora low marsh zones (up to -14 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) displayed highest average CO2 -uptake rates, while those in the native high marsh zone (less than -2 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) were much lower. Unvegetated ponds were typically small sources of CO2 to the atmosphere (< 0.5 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)). Night-time emissions of CO2 averaged only 35% of daytime uptake in the low marsh zone, but they exceeded daytime CO2 uptake by up to threefold in the native high marsh zone. Based on modeling, belowground biomass was the plant metric most strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes in native marsh zones, while none of the plant variables correlated significantly with CH4 fluxes. Methane fluxes did not vary between day and night and did not significantly offset CO2 uptake in any vegetated marsh zones based on sustained global warming potential calculations. These findings suggest that attention to spatial zonation as well as expanded measurements and modeling of GHG emissions across greater temporal scales will help to improve accuracy of carbon accounting in coastal marshes.

TI  - Seasonal Export of Dissolved Organic Matter from a New England Salt Marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) export from a New England salt marsh was investigated using multiple estuary transects along with laboratory plant leaching experiments. From 2001 through 2013, 35 transects of the Neponset Estuary in Boston, Massachusetts, were conducted to measure high-resolution in situ chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, along with other standard oceanographic parameters, via sensors incorporated into an undulating depressor wing known as the mini-shuttle. Water samples were collected during each cruise for discrete dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM fluorescence analyses. Seasonal salt marsh DOC export rates ranged from 1.1 x 10(7) to 15 x 10(7) mol C season(-1) (10-140 mol C m(-2) season(-1)). The total export was found to be 23 +/- 17 x 10(7) mol C y(-1) (210 mol C m(-2) y(-1)) with river discharge, temperature, and day length significantly affecting this rate. Results from seasonal salt marsh vegetation (Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, and Phragmites australis) incubation experiments showed that the leaching of DOC and CDOM from plant biomass was a rapid process occurring over several days. Sunlight exposure, biomass type (above-versus belowground biomass), and microbial activity had significant effects on DOC leaching rates from plant matter. These incubations, in conjunction with the cruise data, support the fall dump hypothesis, in which a pulse of DOC leaches from plants during the fall as marsh plants begin to senesce for winter. The long-term trend in salt marsh DOM contributions to the estuary suggested a decrease in the in situ inputs from the marsh to the estuary during the length of this study.

TI  - Coastal eutrophication as a driver of salt marsh loss
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades(1). Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems(2-4), can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks(5-7). Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.

TI  - Diversity in leaf anatomy, and stomatal distribution and conductance, between salt marsh and freshwater species in the C-4 genus Spartina (Poaceae)
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf anatomy, stomatal density, and leaf conductance were studied in 10 species of Spartina (Poaceae) from low versus high salt marsh, and freshwater habitats.Internal structure, external morphology, cuticle structure, and stomatal densities were studied with light and electron microscopy. Functional significance of leaf structure was examined by measures of CO2 uptake and stomatal distributions.All species have Kranz anatomy and C-4 delta C-13 values. Freshwater species have thin leaves with small ridges on adaxial sides and stomata on both adaxial and abaxial sides. By contrast, salt marsh species have thick leaves with very pronounced ridges on the adaxial side and stomata located almost exclusively on adaxial leaf surfaces. Salt marsh species also have a thicker cuticle on the abaxial than on the adaxial side of leaves, and CO2 uptake during photosynthesis is restricted to the adaxial leaf surface.Salt marsh species are adapted to controlling water loss by having stomata in leaf furrows on the adaxial side, which increases the boundary layer, and by having large leaf ridges that fit together as the leaf rolls during water stress. Differences in structural functional features of photosynthesis in Spartina species are suggested to be related to adaptations to saline environments.

TI  - Compensatory effects stabilize the functioning of Baltic brackish and salt marsh plant communities
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation in plant species abundances and in community composition appears to be a basic ecological trigger that determines changes in community functionality and resilience. Particularly, fluctuations in abundance of dominant species might indicate major changes in resource use and ecosystem functioning. Here we use quantitative surveys of Baltic brackish and salt marsh plant communities to infer how variability in species abundances and environmental conditions influence plant assimilation rates and whether compensatory effects in abundance mask variability in functionality. The variability in species richness and assimilation rates was negatively correlated with average soil organic matter content and moisture and positively correlated with soil pH. It was independent of the variability in soil conditions. The abundances of rare species and species of intermediate abundances increased with increasing community wide assimilation rates. Our findings indicate that the strength of compensatory mechanisms that stabilise assimilation rates in salt marsh environments heavily depend on soil conditions. In the present study sites benign soil conditions stabilized assimilation rates while more stressful conditions caused synchronous fluctuations in total abundance and assimilation.

TI  - Historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion in the Gulf of Mexico: Linking climate change with carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been considerable interest in a recently recognized and important sink in the global carbon pool, commonly referred to as "blue carbon". The major goal of this study was to determine the historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) into salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) and its effects on carbon sequestration and soil chemistry in wetland soils of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used bulk stable isotopic, chemical biomarker analyses, and aerial imagery analysis to identify changes in OC wetland sources, and radiotracers (Cs-137 and Pb-210) for chronology. Soil cores were collected at two sites at Port Aransas, Texas (USA), Harbor Island and Mud Island.Stable isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of all soil samples ranged from -26.8 to -15.6 parts per thousand and 1.8-10.4 parts per thousand and showed a significant trend of increasing depletion for each isotope from bottom to surface soils. The most depleted delta C-13 values were in surface soils at the Mud Island (Mangrove 2) location. Carbon sequestration rates were greater in mangroves and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 sites ranged from 253 to 270 and 101-125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Lignin storage rates were also greater for mangrove sites and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 ranged from 19.5 to 20.1 and 16.5 to 12.8 g lignin m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The Delta(8) and Delta(6) values for all cores ranged from 0.5 to 21.5 and 0.4 to 16.5, respectively, and showed a significant increase from bottom to surface sediments. If regional changes in the Gulf of Mexico are to persist and much of the marsh vegetation was to be replaced by mangroves, there could be significant increases on the overall storage and sequestration of carbon in the coastal zone.

TI  - Using time-series Sentinel-1 data for soil prediction on invaded coastal wetlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal soils are particularly sensitive to nonnative species invasion. In this context, spatially explicit soil information is essential for improving the knowledge of the role of soil in changing environments, supporting coastal sustainable management. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive opportunity to monitor soil because the acquisition of images is independent of weather and daylight. However, SAR has not been commonly used for soil prediction. In this study, we firstly investigated the temporal variation of vegetation canopy and the soil-vegetation relationship using Sentinel-1 data in an invaded coastal wetland. And then we built 3D models to predict soil properties at multiple depths. A total of 16 Sentinel-1 images were acquired in a growing season. A series of soil physicochemical properties were examined including soil bulk density, texture, organic/inorganic carbon, pH, salinity, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio, relating to three depth layers in the top 1-m depth. Our results showed that time-series Sentinel-1 data can capture temporal characteristics of vegetation, and VH/VV was more sensitive to the vegetation growth than VH and VV. The soil-vegetation relationship captured by time-series SAR data was beneficial to predict soil properties, especially for soil chemical properties. The models provided permissible prediction accuracy, with an average RPD of 0.99. We concluded that the prior understanding of the temporal variation of SAR data is essential for developing practical soil prediction strategy. Our results highlight that SAR has the potential to predict a diverse set of soil properties in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation cover.

M3  - Article
AB  - Food sources for the deposit-feeding gastropods Assiminea japonica and Angustassiminea castanea (Gastropoda: Assimineidae) were estimated using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. We collected animals and potential food materials in reed marshes of the Nanakita River estuary, the eastern part of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Feeding experiments were also conducted to confirm whether snails assimilate 4 types of diets. The stable carbon isotope ratios of both assimineid species (mean +/- 1 SD: A. japonica, -20.7 +/- 0.3parts per thousand; A. castanea, -19.8 +/- 0.5parts per thousand) were closer to that of deposited organic matter from lagoon water (-20.7 +/- 0.3parts per thousand) than to those of reed litter (-25.4 +/- 0.1parts per thousand) and the surface soil of the reed marsh (-26.3 +/- 0.1parts per thousand). The snails that were fed deposited organic matter showed delta(13)C values similar to the control animals before feeding experiments for both species. The delta(13)C values of the snails fed litter or soil diet, however, revealed that these snails were able to assimilate organic matter from reed detritus under laboratory conditions. These findings suggest that the salt marsh snails utilized mainly deposited organic matter from lagoon water in the field. Microalgae such as phytoplankton and benthic diatoms in deposited matter are considered to be important food sources for 2 species of assimineids inhabiting salt marshes of the Nanakita River estuary.

TI  - Secondary productivity of macrobenthos in intertidal flat of Luoyuan Bay, Fujian Province of East China.
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the survey data of macrobenthos in the intertidal flat of Luoyuan Bay in 2009, and by using Brey's empirical formula, this paper estimated the macrobenthos secondary productivity, production/biomass (P/B) ratio, and their spatiotemporal distribution patterns in the flat. The annual secondary productivity and P/B ratio of the macrobenthos in the flat were estimated as 18.58 g AFDM (ash free dry mass) . m-2 . a-1 and 0.97, respectively, and the secondary productivity in the Spartina alterniflora marshes of the upper intertidal flat (8.97g AFDM . m-2 . a-1) was much lower than that in the bare flat of the lower intertidal zone (28.19 g AFDM . m-2 . a-1), Since the introduction of S. alterniflora by the end of the 1980s, the secondary productivity of the macrobenthos in the flat had increased about 4 folds. Musculus senhousei, which inhabited in the lower bare flat, contributed 66.4% of the total macrobenthos secondary productivity in the entire intertidal flat. If the contribution from M. senhousei was not taken into account, the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the salt marshes would be significantly higher than that in the bare flat, and the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the intertidal flat would have less change. The successful colonization of M. senhousei was partly attributed to the changes of sediment composition enhanced by S. alterniflora due to its capability in trapping fine-grained materials; this species' feeding activities result in a remarkable increase of sediment chlorophyll a content. There was a significant positive correlation between the secondary productivity of macrobenthos and the sediment chlorophyll a and/or organic matter contents. These findings suggested that salt marshes had effects on the coastal wetland ecosystem via a number of physical and biological mechanisms.

T2  - VEGETATIO
M3  - Article
AB  - New data of aboveground biomass and production of four angiosperms over a 12 month period for the Cantabrian Sea salt marshes (Bay of Biscay, N. Spain) are presented. Based on harvest methods, maximum aboveground total biomass values for Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald, Spartina alterniflora Loisel, Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods and Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen were 628, 1109, 480 and 1267 gm-2, respectively. We conclude that although a slight latitudinal gradient in biomass is revealed in the data compiled with reference to some of the species studied, more work is necessary in order to assess the potential productivity of these ecosystems on the coasts of Europe and/or to make comparisons with salt marshes of the American coasts. Annual net aerial primary production estimates using Smalley's method were: 296, 1160, 486 and 952 gm-2 yr-1, for Spartina maritima, Spartina alterniflora, Salicornia ramosissima and Halimione portulacoides, respectively. These results together with turnover rate estimates point to the lack of vigour of the native S. maritima, while the exotic S. alterniflora, which seems to be spreading along the Cantabrian estuaries, behaves like a veritable pioneer throughout the low marshes in this region.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Plankton Symposium
CL  - PORTUGAL
AB  - Bacterioplankton abundance and activity were studied in the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) to test if tidal resuspension of sediments and transport of particles from the salt marshes may act as factors of variability of bacterial communities. The total and attached cell abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose, as well as seston, chlorophyll alpha and particulate organic carbon (POC) were monitored during four 10-h periods along the tidal cycle at four sampling sites across a transect. The variation of particulate materials (seston, POC and chlorophyll alpha) along the transect was not significantly correlated with either distance to the margin or distance to the sediment surface. Nevertheless, proximity to the salt marsh or to the bottom sediment surface favoured glucose incorporation and aminopeptidase activity. A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis using temperature, salinity, seston, POC, chlorophyll a, distance to sediment surface and distance to the margin as independent variables explained 66.5% of the variability of the fraction of particle-attached bacteria and only a very small proportion (12-43%) of the observed variability of total bacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and glucose utilization. The spatial patterns of variation of the concentration of particulate material (seston, POC and chlorophyll alpha) do not clearly indicate the occurrence of sediment resuspension and runoff from the margins. This, together with the poor contribution of these parameters to the transversal and tidal variability of bacterial activity, dismisses the importance of inputs of suspended material across the sediment/water interface and from neighbouring salt marshes in the control of bacterial density and activity.

T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined geographic variation in the structure and function of salt marsh communities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Focusing on the arthropod community in the dominant salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora, we tested two hypotheses: first, that marsh community structure varies geographically, and second, that two aspects of marsh function (response to eutrophication and addition of dead plant material) also vary geographically. We worked at eleven sites on the Gulf Coast and eleven sites on the Atlantic Coast, dividing each coast up into two geographic areas. Abiotic conditions (tidal range, soil organic content, and water content, but not soil salinity), plant variables (Spartina nitrogen content, height, cover of dead plant material, but not live Spartina percent cover or light interception), and arthropod variables (proportional abundances of predators, sucking herbivores, stem-boring herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, but not total arthropod numbers) varied among the four geographic regions. Latitude and mean tidal range explained much of this geographic variation. Nutrient enrichment increased all arthropod functional groups in the community, consistent with previous experimental results, and had similar effects in all geographic regions, contrary to our hypothesis, suggesting widespread consistency in this aspect of ecosystem function. The addition of dead plant material had surprisingly little effect on the arthropod community. Our results caution against the uncritical extrapolation of work done in one geographic region to another, but indicate that some aspects of marsh function may operate in similar ways in different geographic regions, despite spatial variation in community structure.

TI  - The issue of outwelling in the Guadiana River estuary (Portugal): some findings and research suggestions in the context of recent evidence
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 36th ECSA Conference 2004
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - The "Outwelling Theory" states that salt marshes play a major role in exporting production to adjacent estuarine and coastal ecosystems. However, it has been found that some marshes act as net importers instead of net exporters of organic matter and nutrients. Once we include mangroves and refine the analysis to comprehend bacterioplankton, organic and stable isotope tracers, the picture became, more complex, making room for a revival of the outwelling idea. The exchanges between the Castro Marim salt marsh and the main estuary were tentatively established determining periodically, in a selected cross-section, the concentrations of TSS, FSS, VSS, NH4, NO2, NO3, N-Kjeldhal, SiO4, PO4, TDP, Chlorophyll a and Pheopigments, measuring their fluxes along tidal cycles and computing the corresponding budgets. Apparently, the sedimentary behaviour of the marsh will be close to equilibrium during the period of study. However, it will import mainly inert matter and export mainly organic matter in the same period. Moreover, extrapolating these results to the entire Guadiana salt marshes, the exchanges of sediment do not seem to be significant. Particularly, the marshes will not trap a significantly amount sediment transported by the main river (0.5%). It also seems to follow, that in a general way, the Guadiana salt marshes might have a more significant role than was anticipated in the system economy of OM and nutrients and their outwelling to coastal waters, assuring outputs that could amount to something like 6% of the river load of N, 1.2% of the river load of P, and 20-57% of the river load of TOC, for an average year, and 42% of the river load of N and 35% of the river load of P in a dry year. These findings suggest that a more detailed investigation, over an extended period of time, is certainly worthwhile.

TI  - Shift in soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools in different reclaimed lands following intensive coastal reclamation on the coasts of eastern China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of coastal reclamation on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sinks of coastal wetlands remain unclearly understood. This study was conducted to investigate the alterations of soil organic C and N (SOC and SON) pools following conversion of Phragmites australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields and town construction land through reclamation along Jiangsu coast in eastern China. Coastal reclamation significantly increased stocks of soil total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N (SLOC, SLON, SROC, and SRON), and concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C and N (SMBC and SMBN), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields. However, coastal reclamation reduced SOC, SLOC, SROC, SRON, WSOC, SMBC, SMBN, and MINC following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into town construction land. Our results suggest that coastal reclamation affects C and N sinks of coastal wetlands by changing SOC and SON pools size, stability and dynamics changes following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into other land use types. This finding were primarily attributed to alterations in quantity and quality of exogenous materials returning the soil, and soil physiochemical properties as affected by coastal reclamation.

TI  - Plants mediate soil organic matter decomposition in response to sea level rise
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes have a large capacity for producing and storing organic matter, making their role in the global carbon budget disproportionate to land area. Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.

TI  - Development and N-2-fixing activity of the benthic microbial community in transplanted Spartina alterniflora marshes in North Carolina
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth and maturation of transplanted salt marshes is often limited by the availability of nitrogen (N). We examined the role of N-2-fixing benthic microbial assemblages (microalgae and associated bacteria) in two restored marshes (l-year-old and 6-year-old marsh) and a natural salt marsh in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. Benthic N, fixation (nitrogenase activity NA), chlorophyll a (Chl a concentration, Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) stem counts, and sediment organic matter content were determined in the three marshes. Significant differences were observed between sites for both Chi a and NA. The 1-year-old marsh always exhibited the highest levels of NA and Chi a. Sediment organic matter content was lowest in the 1-year-old marsh (similar to 2%), intermediate in the 6-year-old marsh (similar to 5%), and highest in the natural marsh (similar to 10%). Carbon and nitrogen analyses were also performed on the 1-year-old marsh sediments, which were depleted in N. a positive correlation was observed between surface sediment N and Chi a. Remineralized, microbially derived N may provide growth-limiting inorganic N to Spartina transplants. N-2-fixing microbial assemblages in the 1-year-old marsh may also be an important food source for marsh infauna. Benthic N-2-fixing microbial assemblages play a key role in the N economy of restored salt marshes.

TI  - A high-resolution record of carbon accumulation rates during boreal peatland initiation
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal peatlands are a major global C sink, thus having important feedbacks to climate. A decreased concentration in atmospheric CO2 7000-10 000 yr ago has been linked to variations in peatland C accumulation rates attributed to a warm climate and increased productivity. Yet, this period also corresponds to early stages of peatland development (as peatland was expanding) following retreat of ice sheets and increases in C storage could be associated with wetland evolution via lake filling or following marine shoreline emergence. Unravelling past links amongst peatland dynamics, C storage, and climate will help us assess potential feedbacks from future changes in these systems, but most studies are hampered by low temporal resolution. Here we provide a decadal scale C accumulation record for a fen that has begun transformation from salt marsh within the last 70 yr on the isostatically rebounding coast of James Bay, Qu,bec. We determined time frames for wetland stages using palynological analyses to reconstruct ecological change and Pb-210 and Cs-137 to date the deposit. The average short-term C accumulation rates during the low and high tidal marsh and incipient fen stage (42, 87 and 182 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) were as much as six times higher than the global long-term (millennial) average for northern peatlands. We suggest that the atmospheric CO2 flux during the early Holocene could be attributed, in part, to wetland evolution associated with isostatic rebound, which makes land for new wetland formation. Future climate warming will increase eustatic sea level, decrease rates of land emergence and formation of new coastal wetlands, ultimately decreasing rates of C storage of wetlands on rebounding coastlines.

T2  - Boletin de la Sociedad de Biologia de Concepcion
M3  - Article
AB  - Red discoloured water is a seasonal phenomena, occuring in a salt marsh highly polluted with organic industrial wastes. The organic pollutants derived mainly y from nine fishmeal plant, which waste are discharged directly into the Rocuant salt-marsh. Temperature, BOD, COD, POC, pH, DO, Organic Matter, Total Greases and Nutrients of waste and salt-marsh water were monitoring during a year. Bacterial cocci and rods were extremely abundant in the red coloured waters with biomass estimated in 1.3 .times. 1012 bacterias 1-1 (i.e., 26.0 mg C 1-1). Values estimated for bacterial secondary production (BSP) were 2.51 .times. 1011 cel. 1-1 d-1 (5.02 mg C 1-1 d-1) and four turnover rate were 0.193 d-1. The red pigment was extracted with acetone and showed a main absorption peak at 490 nm and a secondary peak at 800 nm. The isolation and identification of dominant bacterial indicated that belongs to Pseudomonas Genera. The sesonal cycle of marsh coloration was related to the industrial activity, availability of raw industrial materials, industrial processes efficiency and the amount of fresh water flux to the marsh.

TI  - Sources and preservation of organic matter in Plum Island salt marsh sediments (MA, USA): long-chain n-alkanes and stable carbon isotope compositions
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon isotopic (delta(13)C) compositions and n-alkane (nC(16-38)) concentrations were measured for Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 marsh grass, Typha latifolia, a C-3 marsh grass, and three sediment cores collected from middle and upper estuarine sites from the Plum Island salt marshes. Our results indicated that the organic matter preserved in the sediments was highly affected by the marsh plants that dominated the sampling sites. delta(13)C values of organic matter preserved in the upper fresh water site sediment were more negative (-23.0+/-0.3) as affected by the C-3 plants than the values of organic matter preserved in the sediments of middle (-18.9+/-0.8) and mud flat sites (-19.4+/-0.1) as influenced mainly by the C4 marsh plants. The distribution of n-alkanes measured in all sediments showed similar patterns as those determined in the marsh grasses S. alterniflora and T. latifolia, and nC(21) to nC(33) long-chain n-alkanes were the major compounds determined in all sediment samples. The strong odd-to-even carbon numbered n-alkane predominance was found in all three sediments and nC(29) was the most abundant homologue in all samples measured. Both delta(13)C compositions of organic matter and n-alkane distributions in these sediments indicate that the marsh plants could contribute significant amount of organic matter preserved in Plum Island salt marsh sediments. This suggests that salt marshes play an important role in the cycling of nutrients and organic carbon in the estuary and adjacent coastal waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tidal creek and salt marsh sediments in South Carolina coastal estuaries: I. Distribution of trace metals
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-eight tidal creeks were sampled along the South Carolina coast in the summer of 1995 to determine the levels of sediment trace metal contamination associated with different types and varying levels of human development in their watersheds. The particle size and total organic carbon (TOC) content of creek sediments in developed watersheds (i.e., industrial, urban, and suburban) were similar to that in watersheds with little or no development (i.e., forested or reference). Those trace metals commonly associated with urban and industrial sources, including Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg, were in significantly higher concentrations in tidal creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds compared to the suburban and forested watersheds. Sediment trace metal concentrations were similar for creeks located in suburban and forested watersheds and 2 to 10 times lower than the creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds. Concentrations of trace metals primarily associated with the natural weathering of basement rock, including Al, Fe, As, Ni, and Mn, were not significantly different among watershed types. Four of the tidal creek-salt marsh systems were extensively sampled from the creek channel to the marsh-upland interface to characterize sediment trace metal spatial distributions within creek-marsh systems. Sediment particle size, TOC, and trace metal concentrations varied spatially within each creek-marsh system depending on the type of development in the watershed and the probable source of metals. The creek-marsh system selected to represent the industrial development had significantly higher "anthropogenic" trace metal concentrations compared to the other creek-marsh systems. This system also had trace metal distributional patterns that appeared to be associated with several localized sources of metals on the marsh surface. Both the "anthropogenic" and "natural" trace metal concentrations and spatial distributions were similar among and within the forested and suburban creek-marsh systems.

TI  - Utilization of Spartina- and Phragmites-derived dissolved organic matter by bacteria and ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) from Delaware Bay salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis has been invading Spartina-alterniflora-dominated salt marshes throughout the mid-Atlantic. Although, Phragmites has high rates of primary production, it is not known whether this species supports lower trophic levels of a marsh food web in the same manner as Spartina. Using several related photochemical and biological assays, we compared patterns of organic matter flow of plant primary production through a key salt marsh metazoan, the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), using a bacterial intermediate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was derived from plants collected from a Delaware Bay salt marsh and grown in the laboratory with C-14-CO2. Bacterial utilization of plant-derived DOM measured as carbon mineralization revealed that both species provided bioavailable DOM to native salt marsh bacteria. Total carbon mineralization after 19 days was higher for Spartina treatments (36% (CO2)-C-14 +/- 3 SE) compared with Phragmites treatments (29% +/- 2 SE; Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis rank sums test, P < 0.01). Pre-exposing DOM to natural sunlight only enhanced or decreased bioavailability of the DOM to the bacterioplankton during initial measurements (e.g., 7 days or less) but these differences were not significant over the course of the incubations. Mixtures of C-14-labeled bacterioplankton (and possibly organic flocs) from C-14-DOM treatments were cleared by G. demissa at similar rates between Spartina and Phragmites treatments. Moreover, C-14 assimilation efficiencies for material ingested by mussels were high for both plant sources ranging from 74% to 90% and not significantly different between plant sources. Sunlight exposure did not affect the nutritional value of the bacterioplankton DOM assemblage for mussels. There are many possible trophic and habitat differences between Spartina- and Phragmites-dominated marshes that could affect G. demissa but the fate of vascular plant dissolved organic carbon in the DOM to bacterioplankton to mussel trophic pathway appears comparable between these marsh types.

TI  - Legal barriers and enablers for reintroducing tides: An Australian case study in reconverting ponded pasture for climate change mitigation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the globe, areas of the floodplain have been converted to agricultural use - often at the expense of natural ecosystems. In Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to 'ponded pasture' for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands, increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds. Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be considered.This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation, using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota.

Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.

TI  - Vegetable oil spills on salt marsh sediments; comparison between sunflower and linseed oils
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of a simulated spill of sunflower oil in salt marsh sediments were compared with an experiment with linseed oil. Sunflower and linseed oil penetrated the sediments at the same rates but different adsorption of the oils onto sediment particles resulted in the establishment of anaerobic conditions at shallower depths in sediments contaminated with linseed oil than with sunflower oil. The total lipid content of sunflower oil contaminated sediments remained almost stable for 6 months, whilst only 40% of linseed oil remained in the sediment after 2 months. Numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and aerobic oil degrading bacteria in muddy sediment increased rapidly in response to the presence of the oils but bacterial numbers in sandy sediments increased more slowly for sunflower oil. Changes in fatty acid composition indicate similar degradation pathways for both oils but sunflower oil degraded more slowly than linseed oil and thus has the potential for longer lasting effects in marine environments.

TI  - Perennial Pepperweed (Lepidiurn latifolium): Properties of Invaded Tidal Marshes
T2  - INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) is recognized as a threat to wetland habitats throughout much of the western United States, but its role in tidal marshes has not been explored. Over three seasons in three regions of San Francisco Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo, and South San Francisco bays), we characterized locations in tidal marshes where monotypic stands of L. latifolium are replacing the native Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed). Soils within L. latifolium stands had significantly lower moisture, salinity, organic matter, and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) and higher pH than in adjacent S. pacifica stands at similar elevation and distance from channels. In addition, L. latifolium canopies were 2 to 3 times taller, thus increasing light reaching soils, and tended to support different insect/spider assemblages (sampled only at the Suisun site). Patterns were generally consistent across the three sites, although less pronounced for some measures at the South Bay site. Overall, these data suggest that L. latifolium invasion of tidal marshes is leading to modification of both structural and functional properties, several of which might further facilitate spread of the invader; however, additional study is needed to determine cause vs. effect for several soil characteristics.

TI  - Ecological structure and function in a restored versus natural salt marsh
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat reconstruction is commonly employed to restore degraded estuarine habitats and lost ecological functions. In this study, we use a combination of stable isotope analyses and macrofauna community analysis to compare the ecological structure and function between a recently constructed Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and a natural reference habitat over a 2-year period. The restored marsh was successful in providing habitat for economically and ecologically important macrofauna taxa; supporting similar or greater density, biomass, and species richness to the natural reference during all but one sampling period. Stable isotope analyses revealed that communities from the natural and the restored marshes relied on a similar diversity of food resources and that decapods had similar trophic levels. However, some generalist consumers (Palaemonetes spp. and Penaeus aztecus) were more C-13-enriched in the natural marsh, indicating a greater use of macrophyte derived organic matter relative to restored marsh counterparts. This difference was attributed to the higher quantities of macrophyte detritus and organic carbon in natural marsh sediments. Reduced marsh flooding frequency was associated with a reduction in macrofaunal biomass and decapod trophic levels. The restored marsh edge occurred at lower elevations than natural marsh edge, apparently due to reduced fetch and wind-wave exposure provided by the protective berm structures. The lower elevation of the restored marsh edge mitigated negative impacts in sampling periods with low tidal elevations that affected the natural marsh. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering sediment characteristics and elevation in salt marsh constructions.

TI  - The Role of Salt Marsh Structure in the Distribution of Surface Sedimentary Organic Matter
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines spatial variability in sedimentary organic matter (OM). A total of 25 surface sediment samples were analyzed from two transects across a 0.5-km(2) salt marsh island; one transect traverses relatively old marsh and the other a mix of old and new marsh. We use elevation and distance to creek head as geomorphic proxies and associate them with the abundance (carbon, nitrogen) and the isotopic/molecular composition of organic constituents (i.e., lignin). Statistically significant linear correlations were observed between elevation and distance from the creek head with OM content, suggesting a likely geomorphic influence. However, the trend was positive for the older marsh and negative for the new marsh. Hence, sediment sampling at or near levees can give rise to a factor of 5-8 difference in OM content. Also, opposing trends were observed in OM provenance with old marsh having greater contributions of marine algae or allochthonous OM and new marsh having a predominantly autochthonous OM signature. Further, these data reveal two scales of variability in OM content and composition, one at similar to 10(1) m and the other at similar to 10(3) m. We ascribe the 10(1)-m scale variability to the effect of salt marsh geomorphic structure, while the 10(3)-m scale variability is likely related to the differences in local nutrient input and OM preservation and due to sediment source and accumulation rates and processes between sites.

TI  - Hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations
T2  - BIODEGRADATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are often considered sinks for contaminants and the cleanup of salt marshes, sensitive ecosystems with a major ecological role, should be carried out by means of least intrusive approaches, such as bioremediation. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants. This effect, combined with the plant capability to retain hydrocarbons around the roots, points out that salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations may actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation in estuarine environments.

TI  - Nitrous oxide fluxes in estuarine environments: response to global change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nitrous oxide is a powerful, long-lived greenhouse gas, but we know little about the role of estuarine areas in the global N2O budget. This review summarizes 56 studies of N2O fluxes and associated biogeochemical controlling factors in estuarine open waters, salt marshes, mangroves, and intertidal sediments. The majority of in situ N2O production occurs as a result of sediment denitrification, although the water column contributes N2O through nitrification in suspended particles. The most important factors controlling N2O fluxes seem to be dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and oxygen availability, which in turn are affected by tidal cycles, groundwater inputs, and macrophyte density. The heterogeneity of coastal environments leads to a high variability in observations, but on average estuarine open water, intertidal and vegetated environments are sites of a small positive N2O flux to the atmosphere (range 0.15-0.91; median 0.31; Tg N2O-N yr(-1)). Global changes in macrophyte distribution and anthropogenic nitrogen loading are expected to increase N2O emissions from estuaries. We estimate that a doubling of current median NO3- concentrations would increase the global estuary water-air N2O flux by about 0.45 Tg N2O-N yr(-1) or about 190%. A loss of 50% of mangrove habitat, being converted to unvegetated intertidal area, would result in a net decrease in N2O emissions of 0.002 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). In contrast, conversion of 50% of salt marsh to unvegetated area would result in a net increase of 0.001 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). Decreased oxygen concentrations may inhibit production of N2O by nitrification; however, sediment denitrification and the associated ratio of N2O:N-2 is expected to increase.

TI  - Stable isotopes infer the value of Australia's coastal vegetated ecosystems from fisheries
T2  - FISH AND FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild capture fisheries provide substantial input to the global economy through employment and revenue. The coastal zone is especially productive, accounting for just 7% of the total area of the ocean, but supporting an estimated 50% of the world's fisheries. Vegetated coastal ecosystems-seagrass meadows, tidal marshes and mangrove forests-are widely cited as providing nutritional input that underpin coastal fisheries production; however, quantitative evidence of this relationship is scarce. Using Australia as a case study, we synthesized fisheries stable isotope data to estimate nutritional input derived from coastal vegetated ecosystems and combined these "proportional contribution" estimates with total annual catch data from commercial fisheries to determine species-specific dollar values for coastal vegetated ecosystems. Based on the data from 96 commercially important fish species across Australian states (total landings 14 x 10(6) tonnes pa), we provide a conservative estimate that Australia's coastal vegetated ecosystems contribute at least 78 million AUD per year to the fisheries economy. Two thirds of this contribution came from tidal marshes and seagrasses that were both equally valued at 31.5 million AUD per year (39.4%) followed by mangroves at 14.9 million AUD per year (18.6%). The highest dollar values of coastal ecosystems originated from eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) and giant mud crab (Scylla serrata). This study demonstrates the substantial economic value supported by Australia's coastal vegetated ecosystems through commercial fisheries harvest. These estimates create further impetus to conserve and restore coastal wetlands and maintain their support of coastal fisheries into the future.

TI  - Changes to spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) habitat selection in response to a salt marsh restoration
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of coastal New England has led to the replacement of up to 37% of salt marshes with degraded freshwater wetlands, primarily through tidal restrictions. Removing these restrictions to restore salt marsh ecology would improve water quality, increase flood and storm protection, nutrient filtration, erosion control, and carbon sequestration. However, such restorations replace functional freshwater wetlands and could potentially impact freshwater species. Freshwater-dependent wildlife species such as the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), may be especially vulnerable to rapid changes in habitat resulting from tidal reintroduction due to their high site fidelity and limited ability to disperse quickly. Conservation of genetically and physically isolated spotted turtle populations as well as the restoration of salt marshes to mitigate climate change impacts are both high priorities on Nantucket Island. These two priorities conflicted in a project to restore tidal hydrology to an impounded freshwater marsh known to host a robust spotted turtle population. We evaluated changes to spotted turtle home range size and location and habitat use in response to salt marsh restoration over eight years. Home range size did not change but the location of home ranges shifted into bordering wetlands landward of the tidal salt water influence. Spotted turtles selected remaining freshwater marshes and shrub swamps while avoiding developed land and areas of establishing salt marsh within areas that had previously been high quality habitat. This study suggests prioritizing conservation of wetlands adjacent to planned salt marsh restoration to provide habitat for freshwater species to migrate.

TI  - Five years of Deepwater Horizon oil spill effects on marsh periwinkles Littoraria irrorata
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon spill (2010) was the largest marine oil spill in US waters to date and one of the largest worldwide. To examine effects of the oil spill on an important salt marsh species over time, we conducted a meta-analysis on marsh periwinkles Littoraria irrorata using published and unpublished sources spanning more than 5 yr (2010-2015), including newly available Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA) and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) data sets. We tested the hypotheses that the spill decreased mean periwinkle density, reduced mean snail shell length, and changed periwinkle size distribution. Averaged across multiple studies, sites, marsh zones (edge versus interior), and years, our synthesis revealed a negative effect of heavy oiling on periwinkles. Snail densities were reduced by 73% in heavily oiled sites across all study-zone-by-year combinations, including adverse effects for both the oiled marsh edge and oiled marsh interior, with impacts observed over more than 5 yr. Mean periwinkle shell length was somewhat reduced at the oiled marsh edge in a few cases; however, periwinkle size distributions displayed greater relative proportions of smaller adults and sub-adults, and fewer large adults, across all years. Given the spatial and temporal extent of data analyzed, this synthesis provides evidence that the Deepwater Horizon spill suppressed populations of marsh periwinkles in heavily oiled marshes for over 5 yr, and that impacts were ongoing and recovery was incomplete, likely affecting other ecosystem components, including marsh productivity, organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food webs, and associated predators.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on submerged and emergent wetland plants
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged and emergent wetland plant communities are evaluated for their response to global climate change (GCC), focusing on seagrasses, submerged freshwater plants, tidal marsh plants, freshwater marsh plants and mangroves. Similarities and differences are assessed in plant community responses to temperature increase, CO2 increase, greater UV-B exposure, sea level rise and other expected environmental alterations associated with GCC. Responses to most climate change variables are more similar within submerged plant communities, marine or freshwater, than between submerged vs. emergent plant communities. The submerged plants are most affected by temperature increases and indirect impacts on water clarity. Emergent plant communities (marshes and mangroves) respond most directly to climate change related hydrological alterations. Wetland plant communities overall appear to be adversely impacted by all climate change variables, with the exception of increased CO2 in the atmosphere and the oceans, which in most cases increases photosynthesis. Effects of GCC on all these communities have already been seen with many others predicted, including: shifts in species composition, shifts in range and distribution, and declines in plant species richness. Other effects are associated with specific community types, e.g., salt marsh habitat lost to mangrove incursion, and decreases in submerged macrophyte coverage in lakes and estuaries, exacerbated by eutrophication. Sea level rise poses threats to all aquatic plant community types in the vicinity of the oceans, and changes in weather patterns and salinity will affect many. Overall, losses are likely in all these wetland plant communities yet their species can adapt to GCC to some degree if well managed and protected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Oxygen and Triple Oxygen Isotope Measurements Provide Different Insights into Gross Oxygen Production in a Shallow Salt Marsh Pond
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The metabolism of estuarine environments is often estimated by measuring changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. A central assumption of common oxygen-based approaches is that oxygen consumption rates (primarily respiration) are similar under light and dark conditions. Evaluating this assumption is critical, especially in benthic-dominated systems, because differences between daytime and nighttime respiration could result in underestimation or overestimation of ecosystem productivity. We evaluated rates of gross oxygen production over hourly to seasonal time scales in a shallow, temperate salt marsh pond. To assess whether a dissolved oxygen diel mass balance underestimated gross oxygen productivity, we compared rates using this traditional approach and using the triple oxygen isotope tracer of photosynthesis. This is a powerful combination because the triple oxygen isotope approach is theoretically insensitive to respiration. The methods agreed well over daily to seasonal time scales. However, during midday periods of peak light and productivity, the triple oxygen isotope approach resulted in higher hourly scale gross oxygen production rates. The timing and magnitude of this short-term difference is consistent with light-dependent oxygen uptake fluxes including photoreduction and/or light-stimulated community respiration. Finally, aquatic vegetation was associated with variability in productivity across the pond. Such small-scale environmental heterogeneity is evidence that this shallow pond was not laterally well mixed, and likely contributes to the dynamism of these common estuarine environments.

TI  - Nitrate reduction capacity is limited by belowground plant recovery in a 32-year-old created salt marsh
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have decreased global salt marsh surface area with a subsequent loss in the ecosystem functions they provide. The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.

AB  - A field study was conducted in 1996 and 1997 that examined effects of temporal and spatial variability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), macro-epifaunal abundance, and dissolved inorganic nutrients on the abundance and composition of microphytobenthos in salt marsh sediments in Pass Fourchon, LA (U.S.A.). Plans pigment biomarkers were used to monitor seasonal patterns in benthic microalgal abundance and composition across a PAH contamination gradient created by past produced-wafer pumping. The microphytobenthic community at Pass Fourchon was primarily composed of diatoms and cyanobacteria, as indicated by the carotenoid biomarkers fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. Microphytobenthic abundance showed no consistent pattern of variation across stations or seasons; chlorophyll a concentrations generally ranged from 0.2 to 15.9 mu g g dry sediment(-1). Significantly higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were observed in porewaters at the highly contaminated (high PAHs) station; ammonium had the highest range (160 to 8500 mu M at Station la). Higher DIN concentrations were likely due to rapid remineralization of microphytobenthic detritus at the highly contaminated station. Microphytobenthic response to enhanced DIN availability was likely hindered by PAH toxicity and/or macro- and meiobenthic grazing effects. In September of each study year, significant seasonal increases in total PAH concentration in surface sediments were observed at the contaminated sire (Station 1a). Examination of PAH isomer ratios indicates this seasonal pattern was likely due to physical mixing events (i.e. storms) and not to changes in PAH inputs or preferential remineralization of certain PAHs.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF BIODEPOSITION BY FILTER-FEEDING BIVALVES ON SALT-MARSH MEIOBENTHIC COMMUNITIES
T2  - CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of biodeposition by filter-feeding bivalves (Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis) on the evolution of salt-marsh meiobenthic communities of the French atlantic coast was studied over a 15-months period.  Quantitative variations of meiofauna were analyzed monthly and, during some phases of the year cycle, at two or three-days intervals.  The reasons for the recorded faunal variations were searched by principal component analysis among the main physico-chemical factors of the environment and more especially those related to the particulate organic matter of sediments.  Over the concerned period, it seemed difficult to point out the subtle effects of biodeposition on meiofauna as the seasonal factor, basically thermal, was found responsible for the largest quantitative variations observed in the communities.  Nematodes and harpacticoid copepods inversely reacted to the massive input of biodeposits.  Finally, the most striking effect of these was a lowering of populations very likely due to the strong reduction of the substrate (negative Eh) and a rather high content of ammonium in interstitial waters.

TI  - C3/C4 variations in salt-marsh sediments: An application of compound specific isotopic analysis of lipid biomarkers to late Holocene paleoenvironmental research
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In salt-marshes, bulk carbon isotope values reflect organic matter contributions not only from salt-marsh plants, but also from algal and bacterial inputs, as well as allochthonous terrestrial organic matter. In the present study, compound specific isotope analysis was applied to a core and modern plant samples collected from a Machiasport, Maine salt-marsh. We sampled 10 plant species common to the marsh including Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, Juncus gerardi, Solidago sempervirens, Salicornia europa, Potentilla anserina, Atriplex patula, Plantago maritima, Suaeda maritima and Limonium nashii. Isolation of two n-alkanes (C-27 and C-29) present in marsh plant samples allowed for the reconstruction of past plant communities present in the cored deposits. For the C-27 and C-29 homologues there is a 3-10 parts per thousand separation in carbon isotopic composition between C3 and C4 species. Carbon isotopic values down core show a transition from a C4 dominated plant community to a C3 dominated community, attributable to the migration of lower marsh zones onto brackish/freshwater marsh zones during a late Holocene relative sea-level rise. The two homologues used have the potential to provide paleoenvironmental information in future core work, where the sea-level variable will be controlled. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonal variation in the quality of dissolved and particulate organic matter exchanged between a salt marsh and its adjacent estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence was used to examine the quality of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) exchanging between a tidal creek in a created salt marsh and its adjacent estuary in eastern North Carolina, USA. Samples from the creek were collected hourly over four tidal cycles in May, July, August, and October 2011. Absorbance and fluorescence of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and of base-extracted POM (BEPOM) served as the tracers for organic matter quality while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and base-extracted particulate organic carbon (BEPOC) were used to compute fluxes. Fluorescence was modeled using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principle components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC results. Of nine PARAFAC components (C) modeled, C3 represented recalcitrant DOM and C4 represented fresher soil-derived source DOM. Component 1 represented detrital POM, and C6 represented planktonic POM. Based on mass balance, recalcitrant DOC export was 86gCm(-2)yr(-1) and labile DOC export was 49gCm(-2)yr(-1); no planktonic DOC was exported. The marsh also exported 41gCm(-2)yr(-1) of detrital terrestrial POC, which likely originated from lands adjacent to the North River estuary. Planktonic POC export from the marsh was 6gCm(-2)yr(-1). Assuming the exported organic matter was oxidized to CO2 and scaled up to global salt marsh area, respiration of salt marsh DOC and POC transported to estuaries could amount to a global CO2 flux of 11TgCyr(-1), roughly 4% of the recently estimated CO2 release for marshes and estuaries globally.

AB  - A factor analysis was carried out to interpret the variability observed in the data obtained for a salt-marsh area to the south of the Bay of Cadiz in the southwest of Spain. a case involving the quantitation of 15 variables in 273 water samples of the Sancti Petri Channel has been selected for examination, Bn overall synthesis of all the information obtained from the factor analysis establishes five processes that determine the hydrochemistry of the zone: mineralisation, influence of urban effluents, seasonality, degree of agitation and action of the tides, Of all the processes, the mineralisation of the organic matter stands out as the main process determining the hydrochemistry of the zone.

TI  - Patterns in size and species diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in Mediterranean salt marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean salt marsh macroinvertebrate assemblages are abiotically filtered due to harsh environmental conditions. We hypothesized that in these environmentally fluctuating systems, biotic interactions would have more relevance than abiotic ones and that size-based interactions would dominate. The manuscript focuses on the response to biotic and abiotic factors of 2 diversity metrics: (1) one that relies on species identity (Shannon-Wiener diversity), and (2) another based on the shape of biomass size spectra (size diversity). Benthic macroinvertebrates (organisms >1 mm) were the target group of this study and were sampled monthly in 6 basins during 2 flooding cycles (from October 1997 to July 1999). The high inter-annual variability characteristic of Mediterranean systems revealed the robustness of the observed patterns. Abiotic and biotic interactions appeared to be significant for both diversity metrics, with species diversity more abiotically controlled than size diversity. The relationships between size diversity and environmental variables were more interannually stable than those for species diversity. Only water total organic carbon had a robust relationship with species diversity, but dissolved inorganic nitrogen and predatory pressure had a robust relationship with size diversity. Additionally, size diversity had a significant succession pattern related to days after flooding (time), whereas species diversity did not. Our results suggest that in abiotically filtered environments, macroinvertebrate size-based interactions become especially relevant.

TI  - Accumulation and biological cycling of heavy metal in four salt marsh species, from Tagus estuary (Portugal)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pools of Zn, Cu, Cd and Co in leaf, stem and root tissues of Sarcocornia fruticosa, Sarcocornia perennis, Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima were analyzed on a bimonthly basis, in a Tagus estuary salt marsh. All the major concentrations were found in the root tissues, being the concentrations in the aboveground organs neglectable for sediment budget proposes, as seen by the low root-aboveground translocation. Metal annual accumulation, root turnovers and cycling coefficients were also assessed. S. maritima showed the higher root turnovers and cycling coefficients for most of the analyzed metals, making this a phytostabilizer specie. By contrast the low root turnover, cycling coefficient and low root necromass generation makes S. perennis the most suitable specie for phytoremediation processes. Although the high amounts of metal return to the sediments, due to root senescence, salt marshes can still be considered sinks of heavy metals, cycling heavy metals mostly between sediment and root.

TI  - Below- and aboveground Spartina alterniflora production in a Louisiana salt marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monthly variations of below- and aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora were documented for a south Louisiana salt marsh from March 2004 to March 2005, and in March 2006 and 2007. The annual production rate above- and belowground was 1821 and 11,676 g m(-2), respectively (Smalley method), and the annual production rate per biomass belowground was 10.7 g dry weight(-1), which are highs along the latitudinal distributions of the plant's range. The average root + rhizome/shoot ratio (R&R/S) was 2.6:1, which is lower than the R&R/S ratios of 4 to 5.1 reported for Spartina sp. marshes in the northeastern US. The belowground biomass increased from July to September and fluctuated between October and November, after which it declined until February when the growing season began. The belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which declined precipitously in spring and then rose to a seasonal high in the month before declining again as the late summer rise in inflorescence began. Over half of the root biomass in a 30-cm soil profile was in the upper 10 cm, and in the 10- to 20-cm profile for rhizomes. The maximum March biomass above- and belowground was four to five times that of the minimum biomass over the four sampling years. The net standing stock (NSS) of N and P in live biomass aboveground compared to that in the belowground biomass was about 1.7 times higher and equal, respectively, but the NSS of N and P for the live + dead biomass was about six times higher belowground. The average nitrogen/phosphorous molar ratios of 16:1 aboveground is in agreement with the often tested N limitation of biomass accumulation aboveground, whereas the 37:1 belowground ratio suggests that there is an influence of P on R&R foraging for P belowground. Some implications for management and restoration are, in part, that salt marshes should be evaluated and examined using information on the plant's physiology and production both below- and aboveground.

TI  - The effect of oil spills on the bacterial diversity and catabolic function in coastal sediments: a case study on the Prestige oil spill
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accident of the Prestige oil tanker in 2002 contaminated approximately 900 km of the coastline along the northern Spanish shore, as well as parts of Portugal and France coast, with a mixture of heavy crude oil consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, asphaltenes and resins. The capacity of the autochthonous bacterial communities to respond to the oil spill was assessed indirectly by determining the hydrocarbon profiles of weathered oil samples collected along the shore, as well as through isotope ratios of seawater-dissolved CO2, and directly by analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints and 16S rRNA gene libraries. Overall, the results evidenced biodegradation of crude oil components mediated by natural bacterial communities, with a bias towards lighter and less substituted compounds. The changes observed in the Proteobacteria, the most abundant phylum in marine sediments, were related to the metabolic profiles of the sediment. The presence of crude oil in the supratidal and intertidal zones increased the abundance of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, dominated by the groups Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Chromatiales, whilst Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria were more relevant in subtidal zones. The phylum Actinobacteria, and particularly the genus Rhodococcus, was a key player in the microbial response to the spill, especially in the degradation of the alkane fraction. The addition of inorganic fertilizers enhanced total biodegradation rates, suggesting that, in these environments, nutrients were insufficient to support significant growth after the huge increase in carbon sources, as evidenced in other spills. The presence of bacterial communities able to respond to a massive oil input in this area was consistent with the important history of pollution of the region by crude oil.

TI  - Methyl Chloride and Methyl Bromide Production and Consumption in Coastal Antarctic Tundra Soils Subject to Sea Animal Activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl chloride (CH3CI) and methyl bromide (CH3Br) are the predominant carriers of natural chlorine and bromine from the troposphere to the stratosphere, which can catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Here, penguin colony soils (PCS) and the adjacent tundra soils (i.e., penguin-lacking colony soils, PLS), seal colony soils (SCS), tundra marsh soils (TMS), and normal upland tundra soils (UTS) in coastal Antarctica were collected and incubated for the first time to confirm that these soils were CH3Cl and CH3Br sources or sinks. Overall, tundra soil acted as a net sink for CH3Cl and CH3Br with potential flux ranges from -18.1 to -2.8 pmol g(-1) d(-1) and -1.32 to -0.24 pmol g(-1) d(-1), respectively. The deposition of penguin guano or seal excrement into tundra soils facilitated the simultaneous production of CH3Cl and CH3Br and resulted in a smaller sink in PCS, SCS, and PLS. Laboratory-based thermal treatments and anaerobic incubation experiments suggested that the consumption of CH3Cl and CH3Br was predominantly mediated by microbes while the production was abiotic and O-2 independent. Temperature gradient incubations revealed that increasing soil temperature promoted the consumption of CH3Cl and CH3Br in UTS, suggesting that the regional sink may increase with Antarctic warming, depending on changes in soil moisture and abiotic production rates.

TI  - Pyrite accumulation and sulfate depletion as affected by root distribution in a Juncus (needle rush) salt marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate patterns of pyrite accumulation found in a Juncus roemerianus tidal marsh of north Florida. We speculate that the pattern of pyrite accumulation was caused mainly by the distribution of roots. Sediment cores from living stands (LS), dead stands (DS), and recently killed stands (RKS) were collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOG), sulfate, chloride, Cr(II)-reducible sulfide, and biomass of roots and rhizomes. Living roots were distributed mainly in the upper 16 cm and concentrated at 4-10 an below the sediment surface. Pyrite accumulations were significantly different among the three types of sediment cores in the upper 16 an sediment and follow the descending order of DS (615 mu mol cm(-3)) > RKS (547 mu mol cm(-3)) > LS (368 mu mol cm(-3)). Between 20 cm and 30 an, pyrite contents approached values of 40 mu mol cm(-3) and 55 mu mol cm(-3) in all sediment cores. The degree of pyritization approaches 92-94% between 14 an and 20 an where pyrite accumulation was probably limited by available iron. Root distribution also affected the redistribution of iron through iron sulfide formation. Sulfate depletion in the upper 16 cm was higher in RKS (79.3 mu mol cm(-3)) than DS (49.1 mu mol cm(-3)). No significant sulfate depletion was found in LS. Sulfate reduction under DS was likely limited by the readily available substrates. Root distribution had a major influence on pyrite accumulation and sulfate reduction of the marsh, and its effects need to be addressed in studies of wetland sulfur dynamics.

TI  - Soil Carbon Characteristics in Two Mississippi River Deltaic Marshland Profiles
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current understanding of the soil organic matter (SOM) transformation pathways and mechanisms in coastal wetland ecosystems is limited. This study was carried out to characterize and compare chemical composition of below-ground SOM from a freshwater marsh and a saline marsh in coastal Louisiana. Composite samples at three depths (0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 cm) from each site were collected and characterized by solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The C-13 NMR spectral composition of three soil depths of the freshwater marsh was similar and dominated by contribution from polysaccharide carbon (C), followed by equal contributions from aliphatic C and total aromatic C. A steady and more pronounced drop in polysaccharide C with depth, accompanied by the demethoxylation of lignin moieties, was observed in the profiles of the saline marsh. The delta C-13 signature of these marsh soils suggested that much of the C in the saline profile was likely derived from the mixed debris of previous freshwater and saline marsh vegetation rather than from the current salt-tolerant Spartina species alone. It was concluded that the chemical composition of SOM was determined more by the difference between the freshwater and the saline soil environment than by the C source in the coastal wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Tidal creek and salt marsh sediments in South Carolina coastal estuaries: II. Distribution of organic contaminants
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-eight tidal creeks along the South Carolina coast were sampled during the summer of 1995 to determine the levels of sediment contamination including organic chemicals (i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and DDT and its metabolites) associated with different types and varying levels of watershed development (i.e., industrial/urban, suburban, forested, and salt marsh). Organic analysis utilized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) for PAHs, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) for pesticides and PCBs. Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks. The spatial distribution of organic contaminants was evaluated in four of these tidal creek-salt marsh systems representing urban/industrial, suburban, and forested watersheds, from, the creek channel. to the adjacent uplands. The distribution of organic contaminants within each representative creek was not concordant with the total organic carbon or the clay content of the sediment. The representative industrial/urban creek-marsh system, Diesel Creek, had the highest concentration of PAHs in the creek channel and the highest concentration of PCBs and DDT on the marsh surface, primarily in the upper portion of the system, The representative suburban creek-marsh system, Shem Creek, had elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs throughout the entire system. This system also had one site with a total PAH concentration of 324,000 ppb and a total DDT concentration that was 20-100 times higher than the other sites. One of the representative forested creek-marsh systems, Rathall Creek, had low levels of the three organic contaminants except for one sampling site that had PAH concentrations a factor of 10 higher than the other sites. The other representative forested creek-marsh system, Long Creek, bad low levels of PAHs and PCBs, but elevated levels of DDT were observed, particularly in the upper portion on the marsh surface. The results of this study suggest that (1) anthropogenic alteration of the land cover in the watersheds of tidal creek-salt marsh systems may increase the organic contaminant loadings in the sediment, and (2) tidal creek-salt marsh sediments, particularly in the creek channel, are repositories and potentially conduits of organic contaminants from the upland environment to the deeper estuarine areas.

AB  - The use of dredge material is a well-known technique for creating or restoring salt marshes that is expected to become more common along the Gulf of Mexico coast in the future. However, the effectiveness of this restoration method is still questioned. Wetland structural characteristics were compared between four created and three natural salt marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA. The created marshes, formed by the pumping of dredge material into formerly open water areas, represent a chronosequence, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years. Vegetation and soil structural factors were compared to determine whether the created marshes become more similar over time to the natural salt marshes. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2002 using the line-intercept technique.,Site elevations were measured in 2000. Organic matter (OM) was measured in 1996 and 2002, while bulk density and soil particle-size distribution were determined in 2002 only. The natural marshes were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, as were the oldest created marshes; these marshes had the lowest mean site elevations (< 30 cm NGVD). The six-year-old created marsh (formed in 1996) was higher in elevation (> 35 cm NGVD) and became dominated by high marsh (S. patens, Distichlis spicata) and shrub (Baccharis halimifolia, Iva frutescens) species. The higher elevation marsh seems to be following a different plant successional trajectory than the other marshes, indicating a relationship between marsh elevation and species composition. The soils in both the created and natural marshes contain high levels of clays (30-65 %), with sand comprising < 1 % of the soil distribution. OM was significantly greater and bulk density significantly lower in two of the natural marshes when compared to the created marshes. The oldest created marsh had significantly greater OM than the younger created marshes, but it may still take several decades before equivalency is reached with the natural marshes. Vegetation structural characteristics in the created marshes take only a few years to become similar to those in the natural marshes, just so long as the marshes are formed at a proper elevation. This agrees with other studies from North Carolina and Texas. However, it will take several decades for the soil characteristics to reach equivalency with the natural marshes, if they ever will.

TI  - Tidal Marsh Record of Nutrient Loadings in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment and nutrient burial in tidal marshes of Barnegat Bay was investigated using age-dated sediment cores collected along a north-to-south transect. Measurements of radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137) and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) were accompanied by nutrient and organic matter concentrations. Sediment accumulation rates, measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology, ranged from 48 to 81 mg cm(2) y(-1), whereas corresponding accretion rates ranged from 0.16 to 0.30 cm y(-1). Sediment nitrogen (N) accumulation rates increased twofold at an upper bay site, starting in the mid-1950s, whereas at other locations, only small to no increases were seen with time. Phosphorus (P) accumulation was minimal with time. N and P accumulation rates were higher between the 1940s to 1950s at stations BB-1 and BB-3, while higher accumulation rate in the down-bay (BB-4) was identified in the early 1990s. Results indicate that bay marshes can sequester approximately 79 +/- 11% of N and 54 +/- 34% of P entering the Bay from upland sources; thus, these marshes perform an important ecosystem service in the form of nutrient sequestration. Marsh accretion rates at the coring sites fall at, to just below, rates of relative sea-level rise recorded by nearby tide gauges. These relatively low rates of accretion render the marsh vulnerable to inundation should the rate of sea-level rise accelerate in the future.

TI  - INCREASED BURROWING BY FIDDLER-CRABS UCA-RAPAX (SMITH) (DECAPODA, OCYPODIDAE) IN RESPONSE TO LOW FOOD-SUPPLY
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fiddler crab Uca rapax (Smith) feeds on microbes that colonize decaying cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the salt marsh. Crab-burrowing activity brings organic matter to the sediment surface. This fosters microbial growth on the organic matter and stimulates cordgrass growth. Food supply to the crabs is thereby directly and indirectly enhanced. Fiddler crabs may dig more burrows than they require for their protective and physiological needs. There may be a selective advantage in digging burrows in excess of one burrow per crab, because of the benefit of enhancing food supply and decreasing the competition for food. Fiddler crabs may dig burrows "in excess- even when empty burrows are available and they may adjust their burrowing in response to food supply. This hypothesis was examined by (a) comparing burrow and crab density in a salt marsh, then (b) manipulating burrow density and (c) food availability in the laboratory. Furthermore, females were hypothesized to be more sensitive to food availability than males, and small crabs more sensitive than large crabs. Results showed that (a) there were more burrows than fiddler crabs, (b) smaller crabs of both sexes dug new burrows despite the presence of unoccupied burrows and (c) burrowing activity of smaller crabs of both sexes varied with food availability. When food availability was lower, they excavated as much sediment and dug more burrows and burrow branches, while allocating less time to burrowing. They did so by burrowing faster and to lesser depths. Small crabs may be more sensitive to food availability and may be better capable of adjusting their burrowing to food supply.

TI  - Carbon dioxide degassing and inorganic carbon export from a marsh-dominated estuary (the Duplin River): A marsh CO2 pump
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the seasonal changes and the interactions of the CO2 system in a marsh-dominated estuary, the Duplin River, on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Surface water pCO(2), total alkalinity (TA), and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) showed a pronounced seasonal progression in this system. The estuary released 256-306 g C m(-2) (of water) yr(-1) of CO2 to the atmosphere and exported log g C m(-2) (of water) yr(-1) of DIC to adjacent coastal waters. There was a clear seasonal pattern in both fluxes with spring minima, and late summer and fall maxima. Release of inorganic carbon as a respiratory product from surrounding salt marshes is the primary process supporting these two carbon export terms. Concurrently, TA was exported from the Duplin River mainly in summer and fall as a result of anaerobic respiration in marshes. Based on data from the upper Duplin River, export of inorganic carbon from salt marshes was 156 g C m(-1) (of marsh) yr(-1). Extrapolation of this value to all southeastern U.S. salt marshes indicates that they cumulatively export 0.7 x 10(12) g inorganic carbon annually to coastal waters. This export rivals that of riverine inorganic carbon flux. We propose that the CO2 fixation of marsh grasses and the subsequent export of inorganic and organic carbon is one major mechanism that causes the marsh-influenced nearshore and offshore waters in the southeastern U.S. to be annual net sources of atmospheric CO2. We also suggest that this process provides an efficient and unique means for ocean carbon sequestration of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Road Density and Physical Watershed Features in Determining Coastal Marsh Water Quality in Georgian Bay
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a GIS-based approach to examine the influence of road density and physical watershed features (watershed size, wetland cover, and bedrock type) on water quality in coastal marshes of Georgian Bay, Ontario. We created a GIS that included landscape information and water-quality data from a 9-year synoptic survey of 105 coastal marshes covering 28 quaternary watersheds. Multiple regressions and partial correlations were used to discern confounding effects of human-induced (road density) versus natural physical watershed determinants of water quality. Road density was the dominant factor influencing many water quality variables, showing positive correlations with specific conductivity (COND), total suspended solids (TSS), and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) and a negative correlation with overall Water Quality Index scores. Road density also showed positive correlations with total nitrate nitrogen (TNN) and total phosphorus (TP). By comparison, larger watershed area was the main factor leading to elevated TP concentrations. The proportion of the watershed occupied by wetlands explained the largest amount of variation in TNN concentrations (negative correlation) and was also negatively correlated with COND and positively correlated with TSS and ISS when we controlled for road density. Bedrock type did not have a significant effect in any of the models. Our findings suggest that road density is currently the overriding factor governing water quality of coastal marshes in Georgian Bay during the summer low-flow period. We recommend that natural variation in physical watershed characteristics be considered when developing water quality standards and management practices for freshwater coastal areas.

TI  - Elevated CO2 causes a change in microbial communities of rhizosphere and bulk soil of salt marsh system
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using TRFLP and real-time qPCR, this study aimed to investigate the way elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) affects bacteria, fungi, archaea, and sulfate-reducing bacteria in salt marsh systems containing halophyte Suaeda japonica. Moreover, it also aimed to evaluate the effects of eCO(2) in terms of plant interaction by analyzing the rhizosphere and bulk soil separately. We observed that the gene abundance and community structures were affected by eCO(2), and the rhizosphere and bulk soil communities showed a different response. The rhizospheric microbes responded to eCO(2) more strongly than the bulk soil microbes. The results also showed that the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) community was more sensitive to eCO(2) than the general bacterial community. In addition, the findings suggested that bacteria and archaea competed severely when exposed to eCO(2), which caused a dominance of bacteria over archaea or the co-presence of bacteria and archaea with a different micro-niche. Overall, eCO(2) caused a strong change in the microbial community in salt marsh with halophytes, but the overall functional activity of the microbial community was unchanged and balanced by the different response patterns of the bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in our system.

TI  - Nutrient enhanced biodegradation of crude oil in tropical salt marshes
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical salt marshes in Louisiana are at risks of accidental oil spills and remediation of these ecosystems is mainly limited to natural biodegradation due to physical sensitivity of the ecosystems. This study investigated both intrinsic and nutrient enhanced rates of crude oil degradation in core studies. In addition, loading rates of nitrogen and optimal porewater nitrogen concentrations were determined. Nitrogen additions increased biodegradation rates of some alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Addition of NH4+-N increased zero-order mineralization constants of labeled hexadecane and phenanthrene up to 15.4-19.2% (Fourchon marsh) and 56.2% (Ugly Shack Bayou marsh) and rates of total carbon dioxide production up to 14.0-33.1% (Fourchon marsh) and 3.0% (Ugly Shack Bayou marsh), respectively. Efficient biodegradation of crude oil was achieved when NH4+ was applied at the loading rate of 28.3-56.6 g N m(-2) producing porewater concentration at the level of 80-450 mg NH4+-N L-1. No significant lag time was observed indicating that nitrogen application directly stimulates biodegradation of crude oil in tropical salt marshes in Louisiana.

TI  - Monitoring food web changes in tide-restored salt marshes: A carbon stable isotope approach
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary producer (angiosperms, macroalgae, submerged aquatic vegetation), suspended particulate matter, and Fundulus heteroclitus isotope values (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34) were examined to assess their use as indicators for changes in food web support functions in tidally-restored salt marshes. Study sites, located throughout the southern New England region (USA), ranged from Spartina atterniflora-dominated reference marshes, marshes under various regimes and histories of tide restoration, and a severely tide-restricted Phragmites australis marsh. Fundulus delta C-13 values were greater for fish from reference Spartina marshes than for fish from adjacent tide-restricted or tide-restored marshes where higher percent cover of C-3 plants, lower water column salinities, and more negative dissolved inorganic delta C-13 values were observed. The difference in Fundulus delta C-15 values between a tide-restricted Phragmites marsh and an adjacent reference Spartina marsh was great compared to the difference between marshes at various stages of tide restoration and their respective reference marshes, suggesting that food web support functions are restored as the degree of tidal restriction is lessened. While a multiple isotopic approach can provide valuable information for determining specific food sources to consumers, this study demonstrates that monitoring Fundulus delta C-13 values alone may be useful to evaluate the trajectory of ecological change for marshes undergoing tidal restoration.

TI  - Variability of soil organic carbon reservation capability between coastal salt marsh and riverside freshwater wetland in Chongming Dongtan and its microbial mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.

TI  - Contributions of primary organic matter sources to macroinvertebrate production in an intertidal salt marsh (Scirpus triqueter) ecosystem
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic importance of different primary organic matter sources to macroinvertebrates was studied in the intertidal salt marsh (Scirpus triqueter) habitat of the Nakdong River estuary (Korea) using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of primary producers and dominant invertebrates, along with their biomass or abundance, were monitored monthly from December 2004 to November 2005. S. triqueter flourished from spring to summer and vanished in late fall to winter. Biomass of microphytobenthos peaked in late spring to summer. Of 25 taxa of macrozoobenthos collected, 7 were found throughout the year. Despite a dramatic seasonal fluctuation in the marsh club-rush S. triqueter biomass, the expected seasonal change in the isotopic signatures of the 7 dominant macroinvertebrates was not found. A large gap (3.5 to 12.3%o) in the delta C-13 signature between S. triqueter (-27.9 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand) and the marsh-dwelling macroinvertebrates (means from -24.4 to - 15.6 parts per thousand) indicates little utilization of this marsh-derived organic matter by the animals. Surf ace grazers and deposit f eeders (e. g. Hediste japonica, Heteromastus filiformis, Angustassiminea castanea, flyoplax pusilla and Paranthura sp.) had delta C-13 similar to VN and about 4 %. higher than those (- 16.5 +/- 2.1 and 8.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively) of microphytobenthos, revealing that mainly microphytobenthos-derived carbon contributed to their diets. Two suspension-feeding bivalves (e.g. Laternula marilina and Corbicula sp.) showed a similar delta C-13 to that of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in the channel (-23.0 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) and the Nakdong River (-24.5 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand). However, their delta N-15 values are about 4 %. higher than that of channel POM (5.7 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand), but lower compared to that of river POM (-11.6 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand), suggesting that organic matter derived from coastal phytoplankton, not river discharge, is a major nutritional source for these bivalves. Overall, our isotopic data suggest that the S. triqueter-marsh invertebrates are generally more dependent on organic matter derived from algal sources than on S. triqueter or terrestrial sources.

TI  - The Spatial Variability of Organic Matter and Decomposition Processes at the Marsh Scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accretion rate in salt marshes is governed by inorganic soil deposition and soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized. Our findings point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column.

TI  - Effects of increasing salinity on photosynthesis and plant water potential in Kansas salt marsh species
T2  - Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased salinity affects plants by toxic ion effects and by lowering soil water potential, which makes it difficult for plants to take up water. Salt marshes in Kansas are characterized by highly saline soils, but interspecific variation of photosynthesis and water potential in inland salt marsh species has been largely unexplored. Comparisons between species can help give a better understanding of how saline environments are tolerated by different plants. It was hypothesized that non-native Tamarix ramosissima has a greater tolerance to high salinity by maintaining lower water potential compared to the native species Spartina pectinata and Distichlis spicata. In this study, all three species were grown under controlled salinity treatments in a greenhouse experiment to determine if photosynthesis or water potential differ between species. Individuals of 7: ramosissima, S. pectinata, and D. spicata were grown in 0, 15, or 30 g L-1 salinity under greenhouse conditions for two weeks. Photosynthesis was reduced in all species under high salinity and stomates were particularly sensitive to increasing salinity in T ramosissima. Individuals of non-native T. ramosissima were able to lower water potential to a greater extent than native D. spicata and S. pectinata. There is physiological tolerance to high salinity in all species, helping them to survive in conditions of Kansas salt marshes.

TI  - Multivariate analysis of stable-isotope ratios to infer movements and utilization of estuarine organic matter by juvenile weakfish (Cynoscion regalis)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Canonical discriminant analysis of the natural carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes in tissues of young weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) captured in Delaware Bay was used to infer movements of juveniles and to estimate the utilization of estuarine organic matter in this marine transient species. Two gradients emerged in the data. The first was associated with contributions from tidal salt marsh macrophytes, Spartina alterniflora in the polyhaline lower Bay and Phragmites australis in the brackish upper Bay. The second was associated with the expected change in phytoplankton carbon-isotope values along the salinity gradient in addition to the availability of macrophyte-derived organic matter within the Bay. The separation of the gradients reflected differences in the relative contribution of phytoplankton to weakfish secondary production in open waters versus marsh habitats. As they grew, discrepancies between the anticipated isotopic signatures of juvenile weakfish collected in a specific habitat and their actual signatures were interpreted as down-bay movements based on known life-history patterns. The size-specific differences in the isotopic signatures of weakfish suggested that stable-isotope data can be used to gauge the relative magnitude of marsh-derived organic matter exported from Delaware Bay via movements of juveniles out of the estuary.

TI  - Epibenthic invertebrates of natural and constructed marshes of San Diego Bay
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To aid in assessing the functioning of a constructed salt marsh and the adjacent natural marsh, we conducted a one-year study of epibenthic invertebrates using a new sampling method. Invertebrates were trapped in litter bags (5-mm mesh) filled with Spartina foliosa; these were compared with bags containing other substrates (plastic grass, Typha, and Scirpus, all of which trapped fewer individuals than Sparrina-filled bags. A total of 168 Spartina-filled bags trapped 43,531 individuals over 8 sampling dates. Invertebrate abundances differed by season, elevation, cover of Spartina, and marsh type. There were more invertebrates trapped in fall than in winter; there were more in the lower than higher elevation, and in the natural marsh, there were twice as many invertebrates in areas with greater than or equal to 80% cover of Spartina than with less than or equal to 20% cover. The strongest pattern was with marsh type. Natural, fully vegetated marsh had 2-3 times as many individuals as the sparsely-vegetated, 4-year-old constructed marsh. Overall, the most abundant species was a larval dipteran, Pericoma sp., which was up to 9 times more abundant in the natural marsh. An anemone, Diadumene franciscana, was virtually restricted to the natural marsh. However, the more open constructed marsh had significantly more Hemigrapsus oregonensis crabs and more exotic mussels (Musculista senhousia). The invertebrate assemblage in the 4-year-old marsh was not equivalent to that of the natural marsh. Both marshes had 37 species, but species lists were 46% similar for all sites and dates combined, and relative abundances were 67% similar. Coarser sediment, lower organic matter, and sparse vegetative cover were potential causes of significantly lower abundances in the constructed marsh.

TI  - Wetland restoration and methanogenesis: the activity of microbial populations and competition for substrates at different temperatures
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ljubljana marsh in Slovenia is a 16 000 ha area of partly drained fen, intended to be flooded to restore its ecological functions. The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (similar to 30 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization (CO2 and CH4 production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding (> 5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period of 84 d at 15 degrees C and a minimum of 7 d at 37 degrees C, the optimum temperature for methanogenesis. This lag was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H-2 and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14-38 degrees C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91%) mcrA (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found. Our results suggest that methane emission can remain transient and low if water-table fluctuations allow re-oxidation of ferrous iron, sustaining iron reduction as the most important process in terminal carbon mineralization.

TI  - Natural isotopic composition of heterotrophic bacteria to determine the origin of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE III-SCIENCES DE LA VIE-LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies of salt marsh systems have attempted to quantify the flow of organic matter between the land and coastal waters. However, the techniques used could not identify sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) rapidly assimilated by heterothrophic bacteria. Recently, the assay of carbon isotopy ratios has allowed characterization of the different sources of organic matter in salt marshes. In this study, we wanted to find out if the natural isotopic composition assayed in heterotrophic bacteria distinguished the origin of bioavailable DOC. We determined th delta(13)C values for 1) three bacterial strains and their nucleic acids cultured on glucose and tryptose substrates, respectively, and 2) naturally occurring bacteria recovered from seawater in which salt marsh vegetation had been immersed. First, we showed that the isotopic fractionation was the same for the three bacterial stains cultured on the same synthetic substrate, but could vary depending on the nature of DOC. There was no significant difference between the delta(13)C values of bacteria and their nucleic acids. Second, natural bacteria were grown in a medium enriched in DOC from halophytic plants. The delta(13)C values of this community were close to those of dissolved organic carbon from plant leachates. The comparison between the isotopic ratios of natural bacteria in Vibrio alginolyticus showed that the heterogeneity of the bacterial community averaged the isotopic fractionation from the preferential assimilation of organic compounds in the medium by each bacterial strain. The delta(13)C values rcorded for the bacgerial community in the field and their nucleic acids made it possible to identify the source of organic matter readily accessible to microorganisms in a coastal ecosystem.

TI  - Response of methanotrophic activity and community structure to plant invasion in China's coastal wetlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are critical in the global carbon budget while vulnerable to plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a typical invasive plant species, has rapidly expanded in China's coastal area since 1979, which disturbed the carbon cycle of the coastal wetland ecosystems. However, until now, the effect and underlying mechanisms of S. alterniflora invasion on methanotrophs are poorly known in coastal wetlands. Here, a largescale investigation of the activity, abundance and community structure of methanotrophs was conducted in seven wetlands under both native (dominated by Phragmites australis, Kandelia candel or Avicennia marina) and invasive plants (dominated by S. alterniflora) across the southeast coast of China. Compared with the native community, S. alterniflora invasion led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in activity and abundance of methanotrophs, which increased by 62.1% and 64.0% in average, respectively. The invasion of S. alterniflora did not greatly alter the methanotrophic community structure in most of the examined wetlands. However, the relative abundance of type I methanotrophs decreased under P. australis community, while type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis) increased after S. alterniflora invasion. In addition, the soil organic carbon content, ammonium content and salinity were identified as important environmental factors affecting the activity and community structure of methanotrophs. Overall, our results demonstrated that the activity and abundance of methanotrophs responded positively to S. alterniflora invasion, suggesting the important role of methanotrophs in reducing methane emissions from China's coastal wetlands.

TI  - Effects of estuarine organic matter biogeochemistry on the bioaccumulation of PAHs by two epibenthic species
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) were quantified in sediments from two sites in southeastern Louisiana in a 14 d microcosm study using Palaemonetes pugio and Rangia cuneata and two radiolabeled PAHs, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p). For both PAHs studied, mean BSAFs were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in both organisms in sediments from Bayou Trepagnier (BSAF = 0.628 g OC g TLE-1), a brackish swamp, compared to Pass Fourchon (0.065 g OC g TLE-1), a coastal salt marsh. In order to explain observed patterns in BSAFs, organic carbon-normalized PAH distribution coefficients between the sediment and freely dissolved phases (K-OC)(OBS) were determined as well as the various geochemical variables of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM, respectively). These included analyses of particle surface area, total organic carbon (TOC), carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Bayou Trepagnier was higher in surface area, TOC, C:N, as well as DOC suggesting that the difference in BSAFs may be attributed to compositional differences in POM and DOM between sites. We can not exclude the possibility that other factors (such as differences in organism behavior resulting from contrasting sediment characteristics) were responsible for BSAFs varying between the two sites. Phenanthrene BSAFs were typically higher than b[a]p BSAFs, suggesting contaminants were limited in their desorption from sediment particles as a function of PAH molecular weight. Mean BSAFs for both PAHs were higher on Day 7 than on Day 14. The reason for this decrease is unclear, but did not appear to be due to organisms becoming increasingly stressed in the microcosms. Visual observations indicated that animals remained feeding while no decreases in organism total lipid levels were detected. The trends in BSAFs between sites and over the time course of this experiment suggest that contaminant bioaccumulation in estuarine systems should not be considered to be an equilibrium process.

TI  - The effects of elevated CO2 and eutrophication on surface elevation gain in a European salt marsh
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes can play a vital role in mitigating the effects of global environmental change by dissipating incident storm wave energy and, through accretion, tracking increasing water depths consequent upon sea level rise. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nutrient availability are two key variables that can affect the biological processes that contribute to marsh surface elevation gain. We measured the effects of CO2 concentrations and nutrient availability on surface elevation change in intact mixed-species blocks of UK salt marsh using six open-top chambers receiving CO2-enriched (800ppm) or ambient (400ppm) air. We found more rapid surface elevation gain in elevated CO2 conditions: an average increase of 3.4mm over the growing season relative to ambient CO2. Boosted regression analysis to determine the relative influence of different parameters on elevation change identified that a 10% reduction in microbial activity in elevated CO2-grown blocks had a positive influence on elevation. The biomass of Puccinellia maritima also had a positive influence on elevation, while other salt marsh species (e.g. Suaeda maritima) had no influence or a negative impact on elevation. Reduced rates of water use by the vegetation in the high CO2 treatment could be contributing to elevation gain, either directly through reduced soil shrinkage or indirectly by decreasing microbial respiration rates due to lower redox levels in the soil. Eutrophication did not influence elevation change in either CO2 treatment despite doubling aboveground biomass. The role of belowground processes (transpiration, root growth and decomposition) in the vertical adjustment of European salt marshes, which are primarily minerogenic in composition, could increase as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and should be considered in future wetland models for the region. Elevated CO2 conditions could enhance resilience in vulnerable systems such as those with low mineral sediment supply or where migration upwards within the tidal frame is constrained.

TI  - Human activities accelerated the degradation of saline seepweed red beaches by amplifying top-down and bottom-up forces
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes dominated by saline seepweed (Suaeda heteroptera) provide important ecosystem services such as sequestering carbon (blue carbon), maintaining healthy fisheries, and protecting shorelines. These salt marshes also constitute stunning red beach landscapes, and the resulting tourism significantly contributes to the local economy. However, land use change and degradation have led to a substantial loss of the red beach area. It remains unclear how human activities influence the top-down and bottom-up forces that regulate the distribution and succession of these salt marshes and lead to the degradation of the red beaches. We examined how bottom-up forces influenced the germination, emergence, and colonization of saline seepweed with field measurements and a laboratory experiment. We also examined whether top-down forces affected the red beach distribution by conducting a field survey for crab burrows and density, laboratory feeding trials, and waterbird investigations. The higher sediment accretion rate induced by human activities limited the establishment of new red beaches. The construction of tourism facilities and the frequent presence of tourists reduced the density of waterbirds, which in turn increased the density of crabs, intensifying the top-down forces such as predators and herbivores that drive the degradation of the coastal red beaches. Our results show that sediment accretion and plant-herbivory changes induced by human activities were likely the two primary ecological processes leading to the degradation of the red beaches. Human activities significantly shaped the abundance and distribution of the red beaches by altering both top-down and bottom-up ecological processes. Our findings can help us better understand the dynamics of salt marshes and have implications for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Not All Nitrogen Is Created Equal: Differential Effects of Nitrate and Ammonium Enrichment in Coastal Wetlands
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Excess reactive nitrogen (N) flows from agricultural, suburban, and urban systems to coasts, where it causes eutrophication. Coastal wetlands take up some of this N, thereby ameliorating the impacts on nearshore waters. Although the consequences of N on coastal wetlands have been extensively studied, the effect of the specific form of N is not often considered. Both oxidized N forms (nitrate, NO3-) and reduced forms (ammonium, NH4+) can relieve nutrient limitation and increase primary production. However, unlike NH4+, NO3- can also be used as an electron acceptor for microbial respiration. We present results demonstrating that, in salt marshes, microbes use NO3- to support organic matter decomposition and primary production is less stimulated than when enriched with reduced N. Understanding how different forms of N mediate the balance between primary production and decomposition is essential for managing coastal wetlands as N enrichment and sea level rise continue to assail our coasts.

TI  - Component greenhouse gas fluxes and radiative balance from two deltaic marshes in Louisiana: Pairing chamber techniques and eddy covariance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes take up atmospheric CO2 while emitting CO2, CH4, and N2O. This ability to sequester carbon (C) is much greater for wetlands on a per area basis than from most ecosystems, facilitating scientific, political, and economic interest in their value as greenhouse gas sinks. However, the greenhouse gas balance of Gulf of Mexico wetlands is particularly understudied. We describe the net ecosystem exchange (NEEc) of CO2 and CH4 using eddy covariance (EC) in comparison with fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O using chambers from brackish and freshwater marshes in Louisiana, USA. From EC, we found that 182gCm(-2)yr(-1) was lost through NEEc from the brackish marsh. Of this, 11g Cm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CH4 emissions and the remaining 171gCm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CO2 emissions. In contrast, -290gCm(2)yr(-1) was taken up through NEEc by the freshwater marsh, with 47gCm(-2)yr(-1) emitted as CH4 and -337gCm(-2)yr(-1) taken up as CO2. From chambers, we discovered that neither site had large fluxes of N2O. Sustained-flux greenhouse gas accounting metrics indicated that both marshes had a positive (warming) radiative balance, with the brackish marsh having a substantially greater warming effect than the freshwater marsh. That net respiratory emissions of CO2 and CH4 as estimated through chamber techniques were 2-4 times different from emissions estimated through EC requires additional understanding of the artifacts created by different spatial and temporal sampling footprints between techniques.

TI  - Sedimentation rates and heavy metals in a macrotidal salt marsh: Bay of Fundy, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrotidal salt marshes play an important role in sedimentary processes in estuaries and can act as a sink for fine sediments and contaminants. This study examines sedimentation rates and the history of heavy metal accumulation in the Allen Creek salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Pb-210 and Cs-137 measurements and accelerated mass spectrometer (AMS) dating indicate a sedimentation rate of about 1.1 cm/year, which is consistent with independent observations. Elevated normalized concentrations of As in the upper section of the deposit may reflect an increase in organic matter content while a consistent decrease in Mn toward the surface of the section may be due to a decrease in natural supply. A peak in metal concentrations in the early to mid twentieth century is attributed to inputs from local foundries.

TI  - Data from: Indirect human impacts reverse centuries of carbon sequestration and salt marsh accretion
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased      over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of      coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two      century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent      loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments      and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base      and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of      marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon      from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities      exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in      attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted      world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and      despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that      estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may      significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

TI  - Salt marsh surface survives true-to-scale simulated storm surges
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A full-scale controlled experiment was conducted on an excavated and re-assembled coastal wetland surface, typical of floristically diverse northwest European saltmarsh. The experiment was undertaken with true-to-scale water depths and waves in a large wave flume, in order to assess the impact of storm surge conditions on marsh surface soils, initially with three different plant species and then when this marsh canopy had been mowed. The data presented suggests a high bio-geomorphological resilience of salt marshes to vertical sediment removal, with less than 0.6cm average vertical lowering in response to a sequence of simulated storm surge conditions. Both organic matter content and plant species exerted an important influence on both the variability and degree of soil surface stability, with surfaces covered by a flattened canopy of the salt marsh grass Puccinellia experiencing a lower and less variable elevation loss than those characterized by Elymus or Atriplex that exhibited considerable physical damage through stem folding and breakage.

TI  - THE ROLE OF STANDING DEAD SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA AND BENTHIC MICROALGAE IN SALT-MARSH FOOD WEBS - CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON MULTIPLE STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The stable isotope compositions (C, N, and S) of live, senescent, and standing dead Spartina alterniflora were compared in order to determine the effects of aerial decomposition on the isotopic signature of aboveground S. alterniflora tissue entering the food chain. Aerial decomposition of aboveground S. alterniflora resulted in a 6 to 18 parts per thousand increase in delta(34)S and a 2 to 3 parts per thousand decrease in delta(15)N values; delta(13)C values were unchanged. We describe mechanisms whereby the activity of fungi and epiphytic microorganisms may contribute to the observed shifts in delta(34)S and delta(15)N, respectively. The delta(13)C value of salt marsh benthic and epiphytic microalgae ranged from -13.0 parts per thousand in summer to -17.6 parts per thousand in early spring. Average delta(15)N values of microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora were -0.3 and 1.7 parts per thousand, respectively, reflecting the activity of N-2-fixing microorganisms. The delta(15)N values for omnivorous and herbivorous salt marsh macrofauna ranged between 7.5 and 2.2 parts per thousand, and for predatory Fundulus spp. delta(15)N averaged 9.2 parts per thousand. Given a presumptive +3 parts per thousand trophic shift in N assimilation, these results suggest that N-2-fixing microorganisms associated with microalgal communities were an important source of N to salt marsh consumers. The delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S values of primary producers were compared to the values of the following consumers: Fundulus spp., Uca spp., Illyanassa obsoleta, and Littoraria irrorata. delta(13)C VS delta(15)N and delta(13)C vs delta(34)S dual isotope plots demonstrated that microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora are important food resources in the North Carolina (USA) marshes we sampled. In addition, a compilation of literature values suggests that this is true in salt marshes throughout the East and Gulf coasts of North America. Future isotope studies of marsh food webs should include detrital Spartina spp. material in analyses of trophic structure.

TI  - Rapid carbon accumulation following managed realignment on the Bay of Fundy
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and "reclaimed" for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada's Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m(-2) yr(-1), more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Microbiology
CL  - LAS VEGAS, NV
AB  - Past studies of microbial communities responsible for geochemical transformations have been limited by an inability to representatively cultivate, and then identify, the constituent members. Ribosomal RNA sequences, particularly 16S-like rRNAs, provide a measure of phylogenetic relationship that can now be used to examine the structure and diversity of microbial communities. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the sulfur cycle and the terminal mineralization of organic matter in estuarine and marine environments. Because the Gram-negative mesophilic SRB comprise a phylogenetically coherent assemblage, their communities are well suited to explorations through rRNA sequence-based methodologies. In this study we related molecular biological methods using rRNA probes to geochemical measurements at two different sites. At an unvegetated site in northwest Florida, rates of sulfate reduction were low and SRB rRNA comprised about 5% of the total rRNA extracted from the sediment. The other site, a salt marsh in New Hampshire, had higher rates of sulfate-reduction with SRB rRNA accounting for up to 30% of the total rRNA extracted from the sediment. SRB community structure differed dramatically between the two sites with Desulfobulbus rRNA much less abundant in the unvegetated site than in the salt marsh. The differences in these SRB communities reflect differences in the ecology of their habitats.

TI  - Warming accelerates mangrove expansion and surface elevation gain in a subtropical wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Climatic warming can change how coastal wetland plants grow, thus altering their capacity to build land and keep pace with rising seas. As freeze events decline with climate change, mangroves expand their range to higher latitudes and displace salt marsh vegetation. Warmer air temperatures will likely alter above- and below-ground plant dynamics as this dramatic coastal wetland biome shift proceeds, which in turn may result in changes in ecosystem function such as sediment building.2. We used a large scale in situ warming experiment in a subtropical wetland to increase both marsh and mangrove ecosystem air temperatures. We assessed how 2 years of continuous warming influenced above- and below-ground plant growth and surface elevation relative to sea level.3. We found that chronic warming doubled plant height and accelerated the expansion of mangrove into salt marsh vegetation, as indicated by a sixfold greater increase in mangrove cover in warmed plots compared to ambient temperature plots and a corresponding loss in salt marsh cover. Surface elevation gain, a measure of soil-building capacity, increased due to warming over a 2-year period and these changes in surface elevation were driven by increased mangrove root production in warmed plots.4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that, in some coastal wetlands, warming can facilitate plant community changes from marsh to mangrove, with corresponding increases in growth that help coastal wetlands to keep pace with sea-level rise.

TI  - Tidal Marsh Sediment and Carbon Accretion on a Geomorphologically Dynamic Coastline
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the sediment profiles, surface accretion rates, and soil carbon (C) accumulation rates of two brackish tidal marshes on Kilbella and Wannock Rivers of the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, a region where such tidal marsh studies are rare. Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.

TI  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND NUTRIENT ACCUMULATION (N AND P) IN TWO TYPICAL WETLANDS IN SANJIANG PLAIN, NORTHEAST CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating carbon sequestration and nutrient accumulation rates are important to understanding wetland's roles on regional or global carbon cycles. The objectives of this study were to estimate accretion rates of carbon and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) by Cs-137 dating technology in typical meadows (Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland) and marshes (Carex lasiocarpa wetland) in Sanjiang Plain, and to reveal the potential factors influencing carbon sequestrations in wetland. Results indicated that soil accretion rates were 4.26 mm yr(-1) in C. lasiocarpa wetland and 2.55 mm yr(-1) in D. angustifolia wetland, respectively. Consequently, carbon sequestration, N and P accumulation rates were 95.95 +/- 22.76 g C yr(-1) 8.23 +/- 2.30 g N yr(-1) m(-2), and 2.04 +/- 0.90 g P yr(-1) m(-2) inD. angustifolia wetland while these rates were 149.47 +/- 39.54 g C yr(-1) m(-2), 13.17 +/- 3.45 g N yr(-1) m(-2) and 1.96 +/- 0.20 g P yr(-1) m(-2) inC. lasiocarpa wetland, respectively. Carbon sequestration and N accumulation rates were higher in marsh than in meadow while P appeared in contradiction. High carbon and nutrient accumulation rates might due to large plant biomass variations and persistent surface water in marsh.. Correlation analysis showed a high significant positive correlation between carbon sequestration rates and ratios of N to P in soil, implying that its comparative low P contents in marsh soils might contribute to high carbon sequestration rates. It is estimated that carbon sequestration potential abilities had decreased by 2.46x10(6)similar to 3.84x10(6) t C per year in 2005 because of the large wetland areas loss.

TI  - Distribution and Geochemistry of Arsenic in Sediments of the World's Largest Choked Estuary: the Patos Lagoon, Brazil
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The arsenic (As) contents of sediment cores from the Patos Lagoon in southern Brazil were measured to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of As in the estuary. Sediment cores (ca. 60 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in As content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominated). Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores. The data demonstrate clear differences in the geochemical conditions for salt marshes and shallow open waters that can have important implications for As distribution in estuarine sediments.

TI  - Peat Formation Processes Through the Millennia in Tidal Marshes of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine peat formation processes throughout the millennia in four tidal marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Peat cores collected at each site were analyzed for bulk density, loss on ignition, and percent organic carbon. Core data and spline fit age-depth models were used to estimate inorganic sedimentation, organic accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates in the marshes. Bulk density and percent organic matter content of peat fluctuated through time at all sites, suggesting that peat formation processes are dynamic and responsive to watershed conditions. The balance between inorganic sedimentation and organic accumulation at the sites also varied through time, indicating that marshes may rely more strongly on either inorganic or organic matter for peat formation at particular times in their existence. Mean carbon sequestration rates found in this study (0.38-0.79 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) were similar to other long-term estimates for temperate peatlands.

CP  - 41st European Marine Biology Symposium
CL  - Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool, Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, IRELAND
AB  - Chemical associations of Zn, Pb, Cu, Co and Cd were determined using a sequential extraction procedure in sediments colonised by S. maritima in three salt marshes within the Tagus estuary: Rosario, Corroios and Pancas. Concentrations of these metals were also analysed in above- and belowground parts of Spartina maritima, as well as in sediments colonised by the plant. The highest metal concentrations in sediments were found in the marshes near the industrial and urban areas, whereas metal concentrations in plants were not significantly different among sites. This was thought to be a consequence of differences observed in metal bioavailability: Metals in Pancas, the least polluted location, were largely associated to easily accessible fractions for plant uptake, probably as a result of low organic matter content and high sandy fraction in sediments. S. maritima was able to induce the concentration of metals between its roots in the three salt marshes. The results obtained in this study indicate that S. maritima could be useful to induce phytostabilisation of metals in sediments, although the effectiveness to modify chemical associations is highly dependent on existing sediment parameters, and thus different results could be obtained depending on site characteristics.

TI  - Diet of the Mud-Flat Crab Helice tientsinensis in a Korean Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crabs live at high densities in intertidal zones with various halophytes in salt marshes. However, the ecological relationships between crabs and halophytes as well as the impacts of herbivorous crabs on the plant distribution are not fully understood. In this study, we identified halophytic plant species consumed by crabs and determined the relative contributions of halophytes and other food sources to the diet. A DNA analysis of stomach contents was used to determine plant food sources for crabs. We found that the dominant crab species Helice tientsinensis consumed Suaeda japonica, even though several halophytes inhabited the study site. These results indicated that H. tientsinensis is a selective feeder. Based on a stable isotope analysis, we observed a dietary shift during crab development. Immature individuals mainly ate soil organic matter, whereas mature individuals showed more diverse food sources. We observed greater plant (S. japonica) consumption by middle-sized crabs than by crabs of other sizes. Our results for the feeding relationship between crabs and plants extend our understanding of the benthic food web in salt marshes.

TI  - Methane and carbon dioxide flux from a macrotidal salt marsh, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere at 52 sites within a salt marsh were measured by a dark static chamber technique from mid July to mid September. Mean CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) to 11.0 mg m(-2) d(-1), with an overall average of 1.6 mg m(-2) d(-1). Flux of CH4 was inversely correlated (r(2) = 0.23, p = 0.001) with salinity of the upper porewater at the site, suggesting the dominant role of SO42- in inhibiting methanogenesis in salt-marsh sediments. The combination of salinity and water table position was able to explain only 29% of the variance in CH4 emission. Mean soil flux of CO2 ranged from 0.3 g m(-2) d(-1) to 3.7 g m(-2) d(-1), with an overall average of 2.5 g m(-2) d(-1); it was correlated with aboveground biomass (positive, r(2) = 0.38, p = 0.001) and position of the water table (negative, r(2) = 0.55, p = 0.001). The combination of biomass and water table position accounted for 63% of the variance in CO2 flux. There were high variations in gas flux within the six plant communities. The sequences were CH4: upland edge > panne > pool > middle marsh > low marsh > high marsh, and CO2: middle marsh > low marsh > upland edge > high marsh > panne > pool. Compared to other salt-marsh systems, this Bay of Fundy marsh emits small amounts of CH4 and CO2.

TI  - Spartina maritima (cordgrass) rhizosediment extracellular enzymatic activity and its role in organic matter decomposition processes and metal speciation
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal monitoring was carried out to investigate the influence of extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) on metal speciation and organic matter cycling in the rhizosediment of Spartina maritima. Heavy metal speciation was achieved by the Tessier scheme, and showed a similar pattern of variation of the organic-bound fraction, indicating a decomposition process in progress. Both humic acid and organic matter showed the same seasonal pattern. The basal respiration of the rhizosediments also presented a similar seasonal pattern, indicating a microbial degradation of organic matter. The high organic-bound fraction found in the summer gradually decreased towards the winter. This decrease was found to be related to the increase of activity of peroxidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and protease. Also the activity of sulphatase was found to be related to the depletion on the exchangeable fraction, probably due to sulphide formation and consequent mobilization. The results show an interaction between several microbial activities, affecting metal speciation.

TI  - Livestock grazing alters multiple ecosystem properties and services in salt marshes: a meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation.2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing.3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation.4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential.5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities.6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to partition out the predominant anaerobic respiration pathways coupled to C oxidation and to further elucidate the controls of anaerobic C respiration in three major saltmarsh habitats at Skidaway Island, GA; the short form of Spartina alterniflora (SS), the tall form of S. alterniflora (TS), and unvegetated, bioturbated creek-bank (CB). Geochemical analysis of pore water and solid phase constituents revealed that the SS site experienced highly reducing conditions with two orders of magnitude higher pore water sulfide inventories (1.884 mmol m(-2)) than TS (0.003 mmol m(-2)) and CB (0.005 mmol m(-2)), respectively. Conversely, reactive Fe(III) inventories at TS (2208 mmol m(-2)) and CB (2881 mmol m(-2)) were up to 7-9 times higher than at SS (338 mmol m(-2)). Incubations and intact core experiments indicated that SO42- reduction accounted for 95% (SS), 37%) (TS) and 66% (CB) of total anaerobic respiration. There was no detectable Fe(III) reduction at SS, while Fe(III) reduction accounted for up to 70% of C oxidation in the 3-6 cm depth interval at TS and 0-3 cm depth of CB, and on average, approximately 55% of C oxidation over two-thirds of marsh surface area. Laboratory manipulations provided further evidence for the importance of Fe(III) reduction as the accumulation rates of fermentation products were high when Fe(III) reduction was inhibited by removing the Fe(III) minerals from highly bioturbated CB sediments with higher Fe(III) mineral contents. Anaerobic C oxidation, SO42-- and Fe(III)-reduction rates appeared to be highest at the TS site during active plant growth in summer. Overall results suggest that bioturbation by macrofauna is the overriding factor in modulating the pathway of C mineralization in the saltmarsh, whereas availability of organic substrates from plants is a key factor in controlling the C oxidation rate.

TI  - Limited Influence of Urban Stormwater Runoff on Salt Marsh Platform and Marsh Creek Oxygen Dynamics in Coastal Georgia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen concentrations and oxygen utilization rates were monitored continuously for 23 months on marsh platforms and in small tidal creeks at two sites in coastal Georgia, USA, that receive urban stormwater runoff via an extensive network of drainage canals. These data were compared to nearby control sites that receive no significant surface runoff. Overall, rainfall and runoff per se were not associated with differences in the oxygen dynamics among the different locations. Because of the large tidal range and long tidal excursions in coastal Georgia, localized inputs of stormwater runoff are rapidly mixed with large volumes of ambient water. Oxygen concentrations in tidal creeks and on flooded marsh platforms were driven primarily by balances of respiration and photosynthesis in the surrounding regional network of marshes and open estuarine waters. Local respiration, while measurable, was of relatively minor importance in determining oxygen concentrations in tidal floodwaters. Water residence time on the marshes could explain differences in oxygen concentration between the runoff-influenced and control sites.

TI  - Enzymatic activity in the rhizosphere of Spartina maritima: Potential contribution for phytoremediation of metals
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) of five enzymes (peroxidase, phenol oxidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was analysed in sediments colonised by Spartina maritima in two salt marshes (Rosario and Pancas) of the Tagus estuary (Portugal) with different characteristics such as sediment parameters and metal contaminant levels. Our aim was a better understanding of the influence of the halophyte on microbial activity in the rhizosphere under different site conditions, and its potential consequences for metal cycling and phytoremediation in salt marshes. Acid phosphatase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase presented significantly higher EEA in Rosario than in Pancas, whereas the opposite occurred for peroxidase. This was mainly attributed to differences in organic matter between the two sites. A positive correlation between root biomass and EEA of hydrolases (P-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was found, indicating a possible influence of the halophyte in sediment microbial function. This would potentially affect metal cycling in the rhizosphere through microbial reactions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Total concentrations and fractionation of Cu, Zn and Pb in seven operationally defined phases (exchangeable, carbonates, manganese oxides, organic complexes, amorphous iron oxides, crystalline iron oxides and residual) were determined in sediments colonised by the halophyte species Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima in a Tagus estuary salt marsh (Portugal). We aimed to determine whether the speciation of these metals was different in areas colonised by each halophyte. Higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and, in particular Pb, were found in the rhizosphere of S. maritima than in the root sediments of H. portulacoides. Geochemical fractionation of Cu, Zn and Pb in sediments of the salt marsh depended upon the metal, and for Zn and Pb clearly varied with depth and with the colonising species. The higher redox potential observed in sediments colonised by H. portulacoides may in part explain the observed differences in the speciation of Cu, Zn and Pb. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dominance bySpartina densifloraslows salt marsh litter decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Coastal vegetated systems are known to play a fundamental role in climate change mitigation as a result of their efficiency sequestering and storing atmospheric CO2. While most of the work evaluating carbon sequestration capacity has focused on global change factors that can affect carbon release from plant litter decomposition through changes in (large-scale) environmental conditions, less is known about the possible effects of the loss (or replacement) of dominant species. We hypothesized that dominant marsh plants can influence decomposition not only through changes in litter quality but also through changes in (microscale) soil environmental conditions such as humidity, soil temperature or solar radiation. Location We performed a field manipulative experiment in a southwestern (SW) Atlantic salt marsh in Argentina. Methods We simulate a selective disturbance (i.e., removal of the dominant grass speciesSpartina densiflora) thus allowing removal plots to develop an alternative plant community. To evaluate the effect of the dominant grass species on litter decomposition, in an experiment we performed a litterbag approach three years after the establishment of the removal plots. Results Results showed that the presence ofS. densiflorasignificantly decreased litter decomposition directly by producing less labile litter, but also by effects that seem to be related to its structure as standing dominant vegetation. The experimental removal ofS. densifloraled to an alternative plant community, formed by otherwise subordinate species, which is less densely packed, allowing higher radiation incidence on the soil and elevated midday soil temperature. Conclusions Our results suggest that salt marsh litter decomposition, and thus C sequestration, is determined in part by the identity of the dominant plant, not only because of the quality of the produced litter but also as a consequence of the vegetation structure . Changes in species diversity, above all changes in the dominant species in these coastal systems, could have large impacts on the carbon turnover and mitigation capacity of these ecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying the contribution of sediment compaction to late Holocene salt-marsh sea-level reconstructions, North Carolina, USA
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-marsh sediments provide accurate and precise reconstructions of late Holocene relative sea-level changes. However, compaction of salt-marsh stratigraphies can cause post-depositional lowering (PDL) of the samples used to reconstruct sea level, creating an estimation of former sea level that is too low and a rate of rise that is too great. We estimated the contribution of compaction to late Holocene sea-level trends reconstructed at Tump Point, North Carolina, USA. We used a geotechnical model that was empirically calibrated by performing tests on surface sediments from modern depositional environments analogous to those encountered in the sediment core. The model generated depth-specific estimates of PDL, allowing samples to be returned to their depositional altitudes. After removing an estimate of land-level change, error-in-variables changepoint analysis of the decompacted and original sea-level reconstructions identified three trends. Compaction did not generate artificial sea-level trends and cannot be invoked as a causal mechanism for the features in the Tump Point record. The maximum relative contribution of compaction to reconstructed sea-level change was 12%. The decompacted sea-level record shows 1.71 mm yr(-1) of rise since AD 1845.

TI  - Global blue carbon accumulation in tidal wetlands increases with climate change
T2  - NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr(-1), which is similar to 30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.

TI  - Will fluctuations in salt marsh - mangrove dominance alter vulnerability of a subtropical wetland to sea-level rise?
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - To avoid submergence during sea-level rise, coastal wetlands build soil surfaces vertically through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter. At climatic boundaries where mangroves are expanding and replacing salt marsh, wetland capacity to respond to sea-level rise may change. To compare how well mangroves and salt marshes accommodate sea-level rise, we conducted a manipulative field experiment in a subtropical plant community in the rapidly subsiding Mississippi River Delta. Experimental plots were established in spatially equivalent positions along creek banks in monospecific stands of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) or Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and in mixed stands containing both species. To examine the effect of disturbance on elevation dynamics, vegetation in half of the plots was subjected to freezing (mangrove) or wrack burial (salt marsh), which caused shoot mortality. Vertical soil development was monitored for six years with the surface elevation table-marker horizon system.

TI  - Relationships among water-quality parameters from the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, South Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries integrate atmospheric, watershed, oceanic, and human influences over space and time, Therefore, spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water-column properties are useful as metrics to evaluate external factors related to internal processes. The National Estuarine Research Reserve monitoring program, including the North Inlet-Winyah Bay complex in South Carolina, provides an ideal setting to track water quality relationships. Our goal was to assess hydrography, chlorophyll a, and particulate and dissolved materials from monitoring data collected at sites from both the salt and estuarine marsh components since 1993-94. Salinity, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, suspended solids, and chlorophyll a were much greater at the estuarine site, whereas organic nitrogen dominated the total nitrogen pool at both locations. Nitrate was a significant fraction of the total nitrogen pool at the estuarine site but not within the salt marsh. Whereas dissolved organic nitrogen was positively correlated to water temperature, nitrate concentrations were the lowest in the summer, Principal components analysis identified seasonal patterns within the salt marsh for temperature, chlorophyll a, ammonium, suspended solids, and particulate nitrogen. These parameters, grouped together as a primary component, were positively correlated to Spartina alterniflora biomass. In contrast, the estuarine site was more characterized by salinity, pH, and dissolved organic carbon. Although the water-column properties of the salt marsh site reflected a high degree of internal production and remineralization in the summer, patterns at the estuarine site were more likely influenced by seasonal changes in circulation and biogeochemical processing common to coastal plain estuaries.

TI  - Leaching and microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter from salt marsh plants and seagrasses
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is outwelled from highly productive salt marshes, but its sources and fates are unclear. To examine common salt marsh plants as sources of coastal DOM, two dominant salt marsh vascular plants Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemarianus, and two major coastal seagrasses Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii, were collected from a Florida salt marsh and studied using laboratory incubation experiments. We investigated the leaching dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from these plants, in conjunction with our field investigations of the sources and outwelling of DOM from Florida salt marshes. The leaching of DOM and CDOM from the plants was a rapid process, and leaching rates were 65-288 A mu M/g dry weight/day for DOC and 3.8-16 A mu M/g dry weight/day for TDN from different plants in the bacteria-inhibited incubations. DOC was proportional to TDN in the leachates, but the quantity of C and N leached was dependent on the species and growth stage of the plants. At the end of the 25-day experiments, 5.4-23 % and 10-45 % of solid phase C and N were released into DOC and TDN pools, respectively. Bacteria played an important role during the leaching process. The majority of DOC and TDN leached from marsh plants and seagrasses was labile and highly biodegradable with 56-90 % of the leached DOC and 44-72 % of the leached TDN being decomposed at the end of the experiments. The fluorescence measurements of CDOM indicate that organic matter leached from marsh plants and seagrasses contained mainly protein-like DOM which was degraded rapidly by bacteria. Our study suggests that leaching of DOM from salt marsh plants and seagrasses provide not only major sources of DOC, TDN, and CDOM that affect many biogeochemical processes, but also as important food sources to microbial communities in the marsh and adjacent coastal waters.

TI  - Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Intertidal Zone of the Yellow River Estuary in Autumn and Winter During 2011-2012
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much uncertainty exists in spatial and temporal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from coastal marshes in temperate regions. To investigate the spatial and temporal variations of N2O fluxes and determine the environmental factors influencing N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary, China, in situ measurements were conducted in high marsh (HM), middle marsh (MM), low marsh (LM), and mudflat (MF) in autumn and winter during 2011-2012. Results showed that mean N2O fluxes and cumulative N2O emission indicated intertidal zone of the examined marshes as N2O sources over all sampling seasons with range of 0.0051 to 0.0152 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1) and 7.58 to 22.02 mg N2O m(-2), respectively. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O fluxes from the intertidal zone ranged from -0.0004 to 0.0644 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1). The freeze/thaw cycles in sediments during early winter (frequent short-term cycle) and midwinter (long-term cycle) were one of main factors affecting the temporal variations of N2O emission. The spatial variations of N2O fluxes in autumn were mainly dependent on tidal fluctuation and plant composition. The ammonia-nitrogen (NH4 (+)-N) in sediments of MF significantly affected N2O emissions (p < 0.05), and the high concentrations of Fe in sediments might affect the spatial variation of N2O fluxes. This study highlighted the large spatial variation of N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh (coefficient of variation (CV) = 127.86 %) and the temporal variation of N2O fluxes during 2011-2012 (CV = 137.29 %). Presently, the exogenous C and N loadings of the Yellow River estuary are increasing due to human activities; thus, the potential effects of exogenous C and N loadings on N2O emissions during early winter should be paid more attention as the N2O inventory is assessed precisely.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in a coastal barrier salt marsh: the implications for vegetation succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 A factorial fertilizer experiment was conducted in a 15-year-old coastal barrier salt marsh with a low soil nitrogen content, and in an older 100-year-old marsh with a higher nitrogen content. Plots were fertilized at high and low marsh elevations in both marshes. Nitrogen and phosphorus were applied at low and high concentrations both separately and in combination in each of 3 successive years.2 Nitrogen limited above-ground plant growth in both young and old salt marshes in all years. Phosphorus limitation of plant growth was apparent in the first year in the young marsh and in the last year in both marshes. In young marshes with low soil organic matter, phosphorus limitation may occur. In addition, phosphorus limitation occurs at both successional stages when a marsh is saturated with nitrogen.3 Plant species that are typical of nitrogen-rich habitats and late successional stages significantly increased in biomass after fertilization. Limonium vulgare, a low stature species of early and intermediate successional stages, decreased in biomass, whereas the taller Elymus pycnanthus and Artemisia maritima increased. After 3 years of fertilization, plant species composition in a young marsh was similar to the species composition in an unfertilized older marsh. Fertilization of a 100-year-old marsh, however, still resulted in a change in plant species composition, suggesting that succession was still occurring and that, overall, plants in marshes of different age are similar in their response to fertilization.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This "blue carbon" in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30°C) for 161 days. Q10 of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0  0.1 and 2.2  0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ  mol-1 and 58.8 kJ  mol-1 for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90  2.81 Gg C  yr-1 is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Tidal fluxes of dissolved oxygen at the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Advective, dispersive and total dissolved oxygen (DO) fluxes from 1297 complete tidal cycles were analyzed to test the '' outwelling '' hypothesis as it pertains to DO. A 910 day time series of meteorological and water quality data (approximately 35,000 half-hourly observations) was used to assess DO fluxes and dynamics at Crab Haul Creek, a small (1.1 km(2)) tidal salt marsh basin at North Inlet, South Carolina, within the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.A basin storage curve, derived from water velocity measurements made across a permanent transect in the tidal creek every half hour for eight semidiurnal tidal cycles, enabled water discharges to be estimated from tide height readings in the 910 day time series. The discharges along with DO concentration measurements were used to calculate DO fluxes for each tidal cycle in the series.The long-term mean dispersive and advective DO fluxes were -0.281 g O-2 s(-1) and -0.375 g O-2 s(-1), respectively. Based on '' t '' tests both means are significantly less than zero (p < 0.02), indicating exports. Furthermore a significant correlation was found between the dispersive DO export and the tidal mean solar radiation, indicating that photosynthesis is the principal process driving the dispersive export of DO. On the other hand no significant correlations were found between the advective export of DO and solar radiation or between the dispersive fluxes of DO and salt. The absence of such correlations indicates that the advective export of DO is simply an artifact of a slight ebb sampling bias in our computation of the tidal mean discharge. On a unit area basis the average annual dispersive export of DO is 8.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) or 0.28 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1). This is a small fraction of the oxygen produced in the basin by phytoplankton (18 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1)) and its contribution to the DO resources of the receiving waters is far exceeded by the oxygen demand associated with the concurrent export of dissolved organic carbon (200-300 g m(-2) yr(-1)).

TI  - Estimating blue carbon sequestration under coastal management scenarios
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring and protecting "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or re-storing ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of removal of alien Spartina densiflora and restoration of native S. maritima on succession and zonation in European salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ecological zonation and succession are critical concepts to ecology and environmental management, little is known about their development in previously invaded ecosystems after ecological restoration. This present study analyzed plant zonation and succession and the maturation of the abiotic environment of restored Spartina maritima marshes compared to unrestored marshes invaded by Spartina densiflora during a period of 126 months in the Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). These restored marshes hosted seven native halophyte species, which were growing in three distinct bands parallel to the tidal line with contrasting abiotic and biotic development during their rapid maturation: a S. maritima non-successional monospecific band, a lower successional band characterized by increasing abundance of Sarcocornia perennis and an upper successional band characterized by rising abundance of the hybrid Sarcocornia perennis x fruticosa and Atriplex portulacoides. The restoration of these European marshes using S. maritima modified their sedimentary conditions, and the establishment of the native ecological zonation and the development of the ecological succession was successfully achieved. In contrast to this, in unrestored marshes, invaded by S. densiflora, only four native halophytes could be found, and their maturation was very slow. Most of the halophytes occupied a narrower range along the intertidal gradient in unrestored marshes than in the restored marshes. The invasion by S. densiflora altered the native zonation pattern, but this invasion seemed to have been limited by healthy growth areas of S. maritima at low elevations, and also by healthy growth areas of native Amaranthaceae species, at middle elevations.

TI  - Ecosystem type drives tea litter decomposition and associated prokaryotic microbiome communities in freshwater and coastal wetlands at a continental scale
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7-16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Growth and photosynthesis responses of two co-occurring marsh grasses to inundation and varied nutrients
T2  - BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - For tidal marshes of the US Northeast, the late twentieth century decline of Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl. has been attributed to increased flooding associated with accelerated sea level rise and nitrogen over-enrichment from cultural eutrophication. The objective of this study was to examine the impacts of inundation and nutrient availability on growth, photosynthesis, and interactions of S. patens and Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, which co-occur and are common marsh species. Plants were grown in a factorial greenhouse experiment, where flow-through seawater was used to simulate semidiurnal tides. Field surveys were additionally conducted to relate plant distributions to environmental conditions. For S. patens grown in monoculture, nutrient additions did not enhance growth for the high inundation treatment. In addition, the combination of high nutrient availability and high inundation adversely affected S. patens tiller density, photosynthetic efficiency, and leaf CO2 uptake. For D. spicata, nutrient additions enhanced growth for both inundation treatments with respect to aboveground biomass and tiller density. For species pairings, S. patens expanded relative to D. spicata under low inundation, low nutrient availability conditions, but declined relative to D. spicata under daily inundation in combination with nutrient amendments. These findings were additionally supported by field data, which indicated that D. spicata was more common than S. patens where nutrient availability was high. These results suggest that S. patens persistence is favored by low nutrient inputs and well-drained conditions, and supports the interpretation that this species is vulnerable to loss where high nutrient loads coincide with accelerated sea level rise.

TI  - Evaluation of 1-octen-3-ol, carbon dioxide, and light as attractants for mosquitoes associated with two distinct habitats in North Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Field studies were conducted in North Carolina to determine the responses of mosquitoes found in salt marsh and inland creek flood plain areas to 1-octen-3-ol (octenol), carbon dioxide (CO2), and light in various combinations with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps. Over 56,000 adult mosquito specimens of 12 species in 4 genera were collected in the salt marsh. They exhibited a general response pattern of octenol + CO2 + light > CO2 + light = octenol + CO2 > octenol + light > octenol alone. Significantly, more Aedes sollicitans, Ae. taeniorhynchus, Anopheles bradleyi, and Culex salinarius were attracted to octenol + CO2 + light than to CO2 + light. Over 19,000 specimens of 24 species in 7 genera were collected in the inland creek flood plain. Although the response patterns to the attractants were similar to those in the salt marsh area, there was no significant difference between octenol + CO2 + light and CO2 + light. Aedes vexans, An. crucians, and An. punctipennis were attracted nearly equally to these two attractant combinations. These studies demonstrate that responses to combinations of these attractants are species specific. However, different combinations of attractants can significantly increase the collection of targeted species important in arbovirus transmission. The use of these combinations would be very beneficial in mosquito-borne virus surveillance studies. The use of octenol by itself or in conjunction with light was found the least useful for collecting mosquitoes in both habitats.

TI  - Organochlorine contamination of UK Essex coast salt marsh sediments
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsequent to an initial survey of sediments from five salt marshes along the UK Essex coast, samples were taken from a further two sites in Essex and one in North Norfolk. Sites were selected to assess the impact of sediment sources, particle size distribution and organic carbon content upon organochlorine contamination. The determination of average and median concentrations of insecticides and PCB in sediment from cores to a depth of 35 cm identified a degree of contamination that may be considered background in this area. Two sites, at Two Tree Island (in the Thames estuary) and at Bridgewick on the Dengie peninsula, were found to exhibit enhanced degrees of contamination.There was no evidence to link elevated sediment organochlorine concentrations with higher organic carbon content or particle size distribution of the sediments. Distribution of contaminants within sediment particle size fractions, was however, related to the proportion of organic carbon in the < 64 mu m fraction. The most significant factor influencing the degree of contamination with OCL and PCB is likely to be the source of sediments deposited on the salt marsh. Results imply that distance from the Thames estuary, associated sewage sludge dumping areas in the Barrow Deep and the effects of the mass movement of water into the southern North Sea via the English Channel may determine the relative enhancement of organochlorines in sediments of the Essex salt marshes.

AB  - A net material flux study in an estuarine mudflat along the French Atlantic coast, confirmed the general hypothesis already shown in European salt marshes. Despite its small area, the system was not as homogeneous as first thought. The upper part of thr hay imported both dissolved and particulate matter, whereas the lower part exported dissolved and imported particulate matter. Tidal dynamics and water residence time were suspected of enhancing these differences. Particulate mineral import represented more than 70% of the total suspended sediment, with export of silicate, dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll a. It is assumed that phytoplankton and microphytobenthos were exported from the bay in a degraded form. A wide synthesis was conducted integrating the tidal physical dynamics, with the geomorphology of the system, to explain material flux differences between the two sampling sites. Differences of particulate material transport between European and North American systems were verified. New hypotheses relative to the functional role of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos in coastal food chains in European salt marshes were also investigated. In contrast to American systems, mineral particulate import was prevalent in European ecosystems, enhancing growth of small-celled phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. These latter, were sorbed onto sedimenting mineral particles, thus limiting losses from estuaries and explaining the major particulate retention in these systems. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI  - Coastal regime shifts: rapid responses of coastal wetlands to changes in mangrove cover
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global changes are causing broad-scale shifts in vegetation communities worldwide, including coastal habitats where the borders between mangroves and salt marsh are in flux. Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the "optimum" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.

TI  - Physiological responses of the halophyte Sesuvium portulacastrum to salt stress and their relevance for saline soil bio-reclamation
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sesuvium portulacastrum is a facultative halophyte growing in coastal salt marshes. The aim of this study was to determine growth, physiological and biochemical traits of Sesuvium portulacastrum when subjecting pot-grown plants to different concentrations of NaCl supplemented with half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution to get the desired soil electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.3 (control), 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 dS m(-1). Enhancing salinity levels to 12 dS m(-1) resulted in concomitant increase in plant height, number of shoots per plant, number of leaves per plant and leaf area. Plants grown up to EC of 12 dS m(-1) exhibited higher net CO2 assimilation rate (P-N), transpiration rate (E), and water use efficiency (WUE). Significant increases in electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation were observed in plants grown at EC 16 and 20 dS m(-1). Chlorophyll a and carotenoid pigment contents were significantly increased under high salt treatment (up to EC 16 dS m(-1)) and chl a content was higher than chl b. Osmolyte accumulation as a function of osmotic adjustment and antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, GR, SOD, APX and GPX) were maintained under salinity whereas significant Na+ sequestration and Na+/K+ ratio were evident with increase in salinity stress. A preliminary field experiment was conducted by using plants of S. portulacastrum grown for 90 days in control and saline soil of a field plot. The results showed that the desalination potential of the target species was reflected in the reduction of the soil electric conductivity in the salinized plots in addition to significant increases in the Na+ contents in the leaves of the salinity treated plants. To summarize, our results suggest that S. portulacastrum adapts to high salinity with better growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant defense and can be used in the desalination of saline lands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal "blue carbon," (carbon sequestered in salt marsh, mangroves, and seagrasses) is a newly recognized benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)). Protecting coastal carbon leads to co-benefits including resilience to storms and erosion, and fishery benefits, thus blue carbon is a "triple win" for climate mitigation, adaptation, and conservation.

TI  - Reconstructing the development of eutrophication in Louisiana salt marshes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We collected sediment cores from three salt marsh ponds in coastal Louisiana to test the usefulness of proxies of eutrophication. One-centimeter increments of Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated sediment were analyzed for diatoms, pigments (phaeophytin and chlorophyll a), biogenic silica, percentage organic matter, percentage carbon, and percentage nitrogen. Both sediment chlorophyll a and a diatom-based trophic index (TI) were significantly and positively correlated with riverine or local nutrient indices. Two diatom species, Amphora copulata Giffen and Navicula yarrensis Grunow, were significantly and negatively correlated with riverine and local nutrient indices. These results suggest that these variables can be used as potential indicators of trophic status. Results from a complete-linkage cluster analysis on the diatom assemblage data demonstrated that the sediment cores could be split into three time periods: early 1900s (pre-1930s/1940s), mid-1900s (1930s/40s to 1960s/1970s), and late 1900s (1960snos to 1990s). Examination of the sediment chlorophyll a and TI data over these time periods, coupled with an analysis of variance of nutrient inputs between the time periods, suggests that nutrient loading increased dramatically from the mid1960s to the mid-1970s. This study demonstrates that (1) a retrospective analysis of sediment cores can be conducted in highly variable salt marsh ponds and (2) these salt marsh environments are already affected by the higher nutrient loads from both riverine and local processes occurring over the last 50 years. Additional nutrient loading, e.g., from river diversion projects for the lower Mississippi River, may exacerbate eutrophication already evident in the marsh environment.

TI  - Grazing rates of organic matter and living fungal biomass of decaying Spartina alterniflora by three species of salt-marsh invertebrates
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pathway for the flow of salt-marsh grass production into marsh food-webs is still not well defined. We compared the abilities of three marsh macroinvertebrates [salt marsh periwinkles, Littoraria irrorata (Say) (=Littorina irrorata), salt-marsh coffee-bean snails, Melampus bidentatus (Say); and a talitrid amphipod, Uhlorchestia spartinophila Bounsfield and Heard] to access standing-dead leaves of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel). The invertebrates were incubated with naturally-decaying leaves, and the rates of removal of organic matter and living fungal biomass (ergosterol) were measured. The impact of invertebrate activity upon fungal growth rates was measured as rates of fungal-membrane synthesis (incorporation of radioacetate into ergosterol). The removal rates of organic leaf biomass per mg individual biomass were highest for amphipods (700 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)) and lowest for periwinkles (90 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)), but the relatively large biomass of the snails made their removal rates per individual greater than those of amphipods. Net removal of ergosterol by all three invertebrates was >50% for yellow-brown (early-decay) leaf blades. For fully-brown (advanced-decay) blades, >50% removal of ergosterol was found only for periwinkles; exposure to coffee-bean snails and amphipods resulted in a net ergosterol reduction of less than or equal to 20%. The lower net reduction of living fungal biomass by coffee-bean snails and amphipods may have been due to fungal-growth stimulation (2.3-fold stimulation in coffee-bean snails and 1.5-fold stimulation in amphipods). Grazing by periwinkles did not stimulate fungal growth, possibly because of its high intensity. Grazing by these three salt-marsh shredders may affect marsh-grass shoot-decay in different ways. Periwinkles may abbreviate the period of fungal production, and incorporate the decaying material relatively quickly into snail biomass and fecal-pellet rain to the sediments. Coffee-bean snails and amphipods may enhance and prolong fungal production, along with the formation of fecal-pellet rain. All three invertebrates fed preferentially on leaf blades rather than leaf sheaths, and feeding rates of gastropods were higher during the night than during the day.

TI  - Response of a hypersaline salt marsh to a large flood and rainfall event along the west coast of southern Africa
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orange Estuary lost 27% (276 ha) of its wetland area near the mouth as a result of bad management practices during the 1980s. The salt marsh has been unable to recover over the last 20 years because of the persistently high soil and groundwater salinity. In 2006, a 1 in 5 year flood occurred that completely covered the desertified salt marsh and floodplain with freshwater. The flood was followed by an above average (>45 mm) winter rainfall. Soil and groundwater sampled in April and August 2004 were compared with 2006 data to quantify the impact of the flood and rainfall event. It was hypothesised that the two freshwater events would significantly reduce the soil and groundwater salinity. However, the results showed no significant difference in sediment electrical conductivity throughout the soil profile over the four sampling periods. Soil moisture and organic content however increased significantly after these events in the surface soil layer. The flood deposited silt and scoured sand from the surface layers in significant quantities. The depth to groundwater in the desertified marsh retained a similar pattern after the flood despite 15 cm changes in depth in places. In 2004 a clear groundwater electrical conductivity gradient was present extending from the less saline north part of the marsh (0-15 mS cm(-1)) to the central part (120-135 mS cm(-1)) and decreasing again towards the south (60-75 mS cm(-1)). The flood served to even out the groundwater salinity across the desertified marsh (60-90 mS cm(-1)). The flood and high rainfall had a limited impact on the soil and groundwater characteristics. The few significant changes that were recorded were mostly restricted to the surface soil layers and on a small spatial scale. The rainfall did however create numerous pools of low salinity (<60 mS cm(-1)) water on the marsh surface that provided a brief opportunity for salt marsh seeds to germinate. A further benefit of the flood was the increased tidal reach into the desertified marsh importing freshwater from the river mouth and exporting salt. Despite these responses it is unlikely that the hypersaline salt marsh will revegetate naturally. Human intervention is needed to ensure the rehabilitation of this important Ramsar site.

AB  - Predominantly anthropogenic Cu, Zn, and Pb present in an approximately 100 yr old mud flat and salt marsh deposit at a high intertidal, oxic site are bound chiefly in the Fe-Mn oxide-hydroxide, organic and residual phases. The amount of each metal in the organic phase is significant and declines with increase in the age of the buried sediment, in harmony with the total amount of organic matter remaining. Application of a quantitative geochemical model provides evidence that those metals remobilized by the progressive oxic degradation of the organic matter do not swell the oxide phase also present in the deposit, but are free to be flushed back into the estuary.

AB  - Structure of the invertebrate community of the salt marshes of the Bay of Somme (eastern English Channel). Biocoenotics and comparative studies, between grazed and not grazed salt marshes (schorre), have been carried out in the Bay of Somme. Four sampling technics have been used (vacuum, berlese extraction, core sampling and reaping) and have shown a biodiversity of 96 species. They are mostly composed of continental species (91 species). Arthropods (92 species) show dominant densities for Acarina (41,1 %) and Collembola (29,7 %). The specific richness and densities of 21 taxonomic groups remain weak by comparison with those observed in the same ecosystems in North sea, English Channel or Atlantic. However we found a lot of typical species of salt marshes: Amphipoda Talitridae, Coleoptera Carabidae and Trechidae, Araneida Lycosidae. The distribution of species, studied by a multivariate analysis (AFC) may be explained by the influence of the gradient "Sea - Continent" associated to the hydric statement and the substrate which differentiate several types of habitat. The large numbers of sea walls which have been built successively since the last century and the perturbations they induced in the environment, have contributed to slow down and disturb the installation of the fauna.The grazing of ovine or bovine herds seems to favor globally a greatest specific and numeric richness, as well as the diversity of components of the food web in the occupied areas, probably by the important enrichment in organic matter (faeces). Comparative and statistical analyses of these structural parameters showed significant differences between the populations of the two sites, not grazed and grazed, and confirmed also the stability of the last zone.

TI  - Methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes from a temperate salt marsh: Grazing management does not alter Global Warming Potential
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions from cattle grazed and un-grazed temperate upper salt marsh were measured using dark static chambers, monthly for one year. Below-ground gas sampling tubes were also used to measure soil methane (CH4) concentrations. CH4 efflux from grazed and un-grazed salt marsh did not differ significantly although grazing did lead to 'hotspots' of underground CH4 (up to 6% of total air volume) and CH4 efflux (peak of 9 mg m(-2) h(-1)) significantly linked to high soil moisture content, low soil temperatures and the presence of Juncus gerardii. Carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux was greater from the ungrazed marsh (mean of 420 mg m(-2) h(-1)) than the grazed marsh (mean of 333 mg m(-2) h(-1)) throughout most of the year and was positively correlated with the deeper water table and greater soil temperatures. Grazing was not a significant predictor of nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions. Global Warming Potential (GWP; over 100 years), calculated from mean yearly chamber fluxes for CH4 and CO2, did not differ significantly with grazing treatment Seasonal variation in the key drivers of soil greenhouse gas efflux; soil temperature, moisture and water table, plus the presence or absence of aerenchymatous plants such as J. gerardii were more important to the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions than grazing management per se.

AB  - The above-ground biomass of three dominant salt-marsh vascular plants (Juncus kraussii, Sarcocornia quinqueflora and Sporobolus virginicus) was measured to assess both spatial and temporal Variation and to provide baseline data. Additionally, the culm dynamics of the rush J. kraussii were measured so that aboveground productivity could be estimated.No distinct seasonal patterns were detected in above-ground biomass in J. kraussii. Averaged over all sites and times, the above-ground biomass of J. kraussii was 1116 g dry weight m(-2). Culms are replaced annually, hence standing crop approximated annual above-ground productivity. Much of the dead aboveground biomass appears to accumulate in the upper marsh, as evidenced by the elevated nutrient and organic carbon content of the soil there relative to the sediment in the mangrove zone. Above-ground biomass of the decumbent perennial grass Sporobolus virginicus and the procumbent perennial chenopod Sarcocornia quinqueflora showed no consistent spatial or temporal trends. The above-ground standing crops of these species were about one-third that of J. kraussii.

T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NO., the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient. cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).

TI  - Application of stable carbon isotopes for reconstructing salt-marsh floral zones and relative sea level, New Jersey, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated use of delta C-13 in bulk organic sediment to define the botanical origin of samples preserved in coastal sediment as a means to reconstruct relative sea level in New Jersey, USA. Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

AB  - Carr vegetation was once extensive in New Zealand.  It can be divided into Cordyline australis / Carex secta carr, comprising an open wood with scattered large herbs and an abundance of Carex species, and podocarp carr, dominated by tall conifers.  Both have been almost eliminated by agricultural development.  We studied a remnant of Cordyline australis / Carex secta carr in South Island, which graded at one end into salt marsh.  Eight communities were recognized, including one pure salt marsh and two more with saline influence.  Near the stream that provided moisture and alluvium for the area were herbaceous communities.  In the poorly-drained area away from the stream were communities dominated by shrubs and small trees.  The soil environment is similar to that of many European carrs, though generally less organic.  A number of the exotic species are also found in European carrs.

M3  - Data set
AB  - The accretion history of fringing salt marshes located on the south shore of Cape Cod is reconstructed from sediment cores collected in low and high marsh vegetation zones. These marshes are micro-tidal, with a mean tidal range of 0.442 m. Their location within protected embayments and the absence of large rivers results in minimal sediment supply and a dominance of organic matter contributions to sediment peat. Age models based on 210-lead and 137-cesium are constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed over the past century. The continuous rate of supply age model was used to age date 11 cores (10 low marsh and 1 high marsh) across four salt marshes. Both vertical accretion rates and carbon burial increase from 1900 to 2013/14, the years of collection. Elevation of the marsh surface was measured with RTK-GPS to evaluate where the marsh falls within the current tidal frame. The historic marsh surface elevation was then reconstructed using the calculated age of each depth interval and its elevation, assuming that elevations within this shallow zone (less than 30 cm) have been preserved for the past century.

TI  - Effects of soil moisture on carbon mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units, and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on SOC mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies. Soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanent floodplain F0, 1-year floodplain F1, 5-year floodplain F5, 10-year flood plain F10, and 100-year floodplain F100) in the downstream of the Huolin River basin of China. A 30-day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments (i.e., 30%, 60%, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)) was used to identify SOC mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands. Our results showed that the topsoils (0-10 cm) contained significantly higher SOC contents than the subsurface soils (10-20 cm). The SOC contents followed the order of F5 > F0 > F1 > F10 > F100 and the order FO > F5 > F100 > F1 > F10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils, respectively, of five floodplain wetlands. The optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization of the topsoils was 30% WHC in F100, and 60% WHC in the other four wetlands. In the case of all the subsurface soils, 30% WHC was the optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization. The mineralization processes of SOC (especially the active carbon pool) could be better fitted by first-order kinetic models (R-2 > 0.98). The topsoils basically showed a lower C-0/SOC ratio (C-0: the potentially mineralized carbon) than the subsurface soils, except in the case of 60% and 100% WHC in F0 and F5. Under higher soil moisture conditions, the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity (p < 0.05). Under low soil moisture condition, C-0/SOC showed significant correlations with soil pH (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands.

TI  - Coastal setting determines tidal marsh sustainability with accelerating sea-level rise
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing concern over how accelerated rates of sea-level rise (SLR) will impact tidal marsh ecosystems. The present study evaluates the potential impacts of SLR on marsh sustainability using the Tidal Marsh Model (TMM) with the addition of a new vegetation algorithm within the SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) framework. This new functionality contributes to an improved understanding of how vegetation affects the mean flow velocity and turbulence, and consequently, the sedimentation processes. Using two SLR scenarios (intermediate and extreme SLR rates), we projected the changes in marsh extent over the next 50 years in two representative marsh systems within a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. Each study site has marshes associated with different physical settings and anthropogenic components: Carter Creek (developed, high topography) vs. Taskinas Creek (natural, low topography, steep banks). Carter Creek experienced a net marsh loss of 7.3% and 60% in the intermediate and extreme SLR scenario, respectively. In some places, due to the local geomorphic settings, marshes were able to migrate inland and offset part of the total loss, whereas marsh transgression was truncated near development and hardened shoreline structures. In Taskinas Creek, marshes are associated with natural lands with steep upland slopes (inhibitor for marsh transgression due to SLR). Marsh net decline was 23.1% (intermediate SLR scenario), and 89.6% (extreme SLR scenario). Marsh transgression was not substantial in this site, suggesting that marsh loss can be primarily attributed to upland bank conditions which prevented marsh migration with accelerated SLR rates. The enhanced TMM provides the highly-resolved simulations of multi-scale processes needed to inform restoration, strategic planning, and monitoring activities to support marsh sustainability in an evolving system.

However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the loss of marsh vegetation because of human-driven disturbances such as sea level rise and oil spills can potentially reduce marsh capacity for N removal. To investigate the effect of vegetation loss on ecosystem N removal, we contrasted denitrification capacity in marsh and subtidal sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using a combination of N-29(2) and N-30(2) production (isotope pairing), denitrification potential measurements (acetylene block), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of functional genes in the denitrification pathway. We found that, on average, denitrification capacity was 4 times higher in vegetated sediments because of a combination of enhanced nitrification and higher organic carbon availability. The abundance of nirS-type denitrifers indicated that marsh vegetation regulates the activity, rather than the abundance, of denitrifier communities. We estimated that marsh sediments remove an average of 3.6 t N km(-2) y(-1) compared to 0.9 t N km(-2) y(-1) in unvegetated sediments. Overall, our findings indicate that marsh loss results in a substantial loss of N removal capacity in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - A combined field and modeling study of groundwater flow in a tidal marsh
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bald mud beaches were found among the mangrove marshes in Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. To investigate the possible reasons for this phenomenon, the intertidal zones of a mangrove transect and a bald beach transect with similar topography and tidal actions were selected for comparison study. Along both transects, observed water table variations were significant in the high and low intertidal zones and negligible in the middle intertidal zones. Despite the same tidal actions and above-mentioned similarities, observed groundwater salinity was significantly smaller along the mangrove transect (average 23.0 ppt) than along the bald beach transect (average 28.5 ppt). These observations invite one hypothesis: the hydraulic structure of tidal marsh and freshwater availability may be the main hydrogeological factors critical to mangrove development. Two-dimensional numerical simulations corroborated the speculation and gave results in line with the observed water table. The two transects investigated were found to have a mud-sand two-layered structure: a surface zone of low-permeability mud and an underlying high-permeability zone that outcrops at the high and low tide lines. The freshwater recharge from inland is considerable along the mangrove transect but negligible along the bald beach transect. The high-permeability zone may provide opportunity for the plants in the mangrove marsh to uptake freshwater and oxygen through their roots extending downward into the high-permeability zone, which may help limit the buildup of salt in the root zone caused by evapotranspiration and enhance salt removal, which may further increase the production of marsh grasses and influence their spatial distribution. The bald beach is most probably due to the lack of enough freshwater for generating a brackish beach soil condition essential to mangrove growth. It is also indicated that seawater infiltrated the high-permeability zone through its outcrop near the high intertidal zone, and discharged from the tidal river bank in the vicinity of the low tide line. These processes thereby formed a tide-induced seawater-groundwater circulation, which likely provided considerable contribution to the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Finally, implications and uncertainties behind this study were summarized for future examinations.

TI  - Sediments in marsh ponds of the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain: effects of structural marsh management and salinity
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical characteristics of sediments in coastal marsh ponds (flooded zones of marsh associated with little vegetation) have important ecological consequences because they determine compositions of benthic invertebrate communities, which in turn influence compositions of waterbird communities. Sediments in marsh ponds of the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain potentially are affected by (1) structural marsh management (levees, water control structures and impoundments; SMM), and (2) variation in salinity. Based on available literature concerning effects of SMM on sediments in emergent plant zones (zones of marsh occasionally flooded and associated with dense vegetation) of coastal marshes, we predicted that SMM would increase sediment carbon content and sediment hardness, and decrease oxygen penetration (O-2 depth) and the silt-clay fraction in marsh pond sediments. Assuming that freshwater marshes are more productive than are saline marshes, we also predicted that sediments of impounded freshwater marsh ponds would contain more carbon than those of impounded oligohaline and mesohaline marsh ponds, whereas C:N ratio, sediment hardness, silt-clay fraction, and O-2 depth would be similar among pond types. Accordingly, we measured sediment variables within ponds of impounded and unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, near Grand Chenier, Louisiana. To test the above predictions, we compared sediment variables (1) between ponds of impounded (IM) and unimpounded mesohaline marshes (UM), and (2) among ponds of impounded freshwater (IF), oligohaline (10), and mesohaline (IM) marshes. An a priori multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) contrast indicated that sediments differed between IM and UM marsh ponds. As predicted, the silt-clay fraction and O-2 depth were lower and carbon content, C:N ratio, and sediment hardness were higher in IM than in UM marsh ponds. An a priori MANOVA contrast also indicated that sediments differed among IF, 10, and IM marsh ponds. As predicted, carbon content was higher in IF marsh ponds than in ponds of other impounded marsh types. In contrast to our predictions, C:N ratio and sediment hardness were lowest and silt-clay fraction and O-2 depth were highest in 10 and IM marsh ponds. Our results indicated that SMM has affected physical properties of sediments in coastal marsh ponds. Moreover, sediments in IF marsh ponds were affected more so than were those in 10 and IM marsh ponds. Our results, in conjunction with those of previous studies, indicated that sediments of marsh ponds and emergent plant zones differed greatly. We predict that changes in pond sediments due to SMM will promote greater epifaunal macroinvertebrate biomass, which in turn should attract larger populations of wintering waterbirds. However, waterbirds that filter or probe soft sediments may be negatively affected by SMM because of the expected decrease in infaunal invertebrate biomass.

TI  - Revisiting the outwelling hypothesis: Modelling salt marsh detrital metal exports under extreme climatic events
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tagus estuary is a mesotidal estuary located on the Western Portuguese coast, and is characterized by large areas of salt marshes (17.24 km(2)) and tidal flats distributed along the margins. Halophyte vegetation in this system concentrates heavy metals during the growing season and subsequently releases these metals to the environment following senescence. Although there currently there are no metal discharges to the estuary, this was not true in the past, and there are still large amounts of legacy metals within the system. The results presented here show that marshes in the Tagus estuary, can export metal contaminants at the rate of 162 Zn kg m(2) y(-1), 26 Cu kg m(2) y(-1), 28 Pb kg m(2) y(-1) and 1 Cd kg m(2) y(-1). Eddies are generated inside the estuary during frequent flood events, enhancing erosion and transport of particles. During neap tide periods plant detritus is mostly retained in the inner estuary in the vicinity of the marsh source; during spring tides, however, export to the main channel and to the ocean is significantly increased. Sea level rise (SLR) and/or expected increase in the frequency of flood events will increase detrital movement within the estuary and discharges of metal contaminated particles to the ocean shelf. This research highlights the capacity of the present estuary to moderate fluxes of legacy metals to the ocean, but also calls for efforts to reduce present contaminant inputs from the watershed to mitigate contaminant transport to the ocean in the future.

TI  - ENSO episodes modify plant/terrestrial-herbivore interactions in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hemisphere scale events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can alter rainfall regimes worldwide, with important effects on species abundance and distribution. The evidence of ENSO effects on terrestrial communities is, however, restricted to a few ecosystem types. We explored the effects of ENSO episodes on plant/terrestrial-herbivore interactions through changes in the rainfall regime in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh (Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina. 37 degrees 40'S, 57 degrees 23'W). Surveys showed a positive relationship between winter rainfall and the abundance of the wild guinea pig Cavia aperea. The highest salt marsh abundances of C. aperea were associated with rainy periods during El Nino episodes, and the lowest ones were associated with the driest La Nina episodes. Rainfall was negatively associated with marsh sediment salinity, and experiments revealed that increased salinity reduces growth and increases mortality of cordgrass (Spartina densiflora). Salt increase also causes the highest percentage of dry area in S. densiflora leaves and reduced carbon content, and more salt content and secretion in S. densiflora stems. A factorial experiment in which we manipulated C. aperea presence and salinity along the edges of S. densiflora patches showed that plants can asexually invade unvegetated areas when salinity is reduced and C. aperea is excluded. Conversely, S. densiflora edges retracted when salinity was increased or there was C. aperea herbivory. Changes in nutritional quality of S. densiflora could explain the low herbivory of (and lack of impacts from) C. aperea in plots with high salinity. Thus, plant distribution responds directly to climate oscillations through changes in salt stress, and indirectly, through changes in plant-herbivore interactions. Herbivores respond indirectly to climate oscillations through changes in plant food quality, which suggests that top-down effects increase when bottom-up stressors are relaxed. ENSO events have direct and indirect effects on marsh communities that modulate the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects and have a considerable effect on the primary productivity of S. densiflora marshes.

TI  - Effects of the Herbicide Diuron on Cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) Reflectance and Photosynthetic Parameters
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early indicators of salt marsh plant stress are needed to detect stress before it is manifested as changes in biomass and coverage. We explored a variety of leaf-level spectral reflectance and fluorescence variables as indicators of stress in response to the herbicide diuron. Diuron, a Photosystem II inhibitor, is heavily used in areas adjacent to estuaries, but its ecological effects are just beginning to be recognized. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed Spartina foliosa, the native cordgrass in California salt marshes, to two levels of diuron. After plant exposure to diuron for 28 days, all spectral reflectance indices and virtually all fluorescence parameters indicated reduced pigment and photosynthetic function, verified as reduced CO(2) assimilation. Diuron exposure was not evident, however, in plant morphometry, indicating that reflectance and fluorescence were effective indicators of sub-lethal diuron exposure. Several indices (spectral reflectance index ARI and fluorescence parameters EQY, Fo, and maximum rETR) were sensitive to diuron concentration. In field trials, most of the indices as well as biomass, % cover, and canopy height varied predictably and significantly across a pesticide gradient. In the field, ARI and Fo regressed most significantly and strongly with pesticide levels. The responses of ARI and Fo in both the laboratory and the field make these indices promising as sensitive, rapid, non-destructive indicators of responses of S. foliosa to herbicides in the field. These techniques are employed in remote sensing and could potentially provide a link between landscapes of stressed vegetation and the causative stressor(s), which is crucial for effective regulation of pollution.

TI  - The weathering of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: insights from the chemical composition of the oil from the sea surface, salt marshes and sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil released during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill may have both short-and long-time impacts on the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. An understanding of how the composition and concentration of the oil are altered by weathering, including chemical, physical and biological processes, is needed to evaluate the oil toxicity and impact on the ecosystem in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This study examined petroleum hydrocarbons in oil mousse collected from the sea surface and salt marshes, and in oil deposited in sediments adjacent to the wellhead after the DWH oil spill. Oil mousses were collected at two stations (OSS and CT, located 130 and 85 km away from the wellhead, respectively) in May 2010, and two sediment samples from stations SG and SC, within 6 km of the wellhead, in May 2011. We also collected oil mousse from salt marshes at Marsh Point (MP), Mississippi, 186 km away from the wellhead in July 2010. In these samples, n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylated PAHs, BTEX (collective name of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-, m-, and o-xylenes), C3-benzenes and trace metals were measured to examine how the oil was altered chemically. The chemical analysis indicates that the oil mousses underwent different degrees of weathering with the pattern of OSS < CT < MP. This pattern is consistent with the projected oil mousse movement from the accident site to salt marshes. Also, the contents of trace metals Al, V, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As and Pb in the oil mousse generally increased along the way to the salt marshes, indicating that these trace metals were perhaps aggregated into the oil mousse during the transport. Petroleum hydrocarbon data reveal that the oil deposited in sediments underwent only light to moderate degradation one year after the DWH oil spill, as supported by the presence of short-chained n-alkanes (C10-C15), BTEX and C3-benzenes. The weathering of oil in sediment may result from biological degradation and dissolution, evidenced by the preferential loss of mid-chained n- alkanes C16-C27, lower ratios of n-C-17/Pr and n-C-18/Ph, and preferential loss of PAHs relative to alkylated PAHs.

TI  - Combining eddy-covariance and chamber measurements to determine the methane budget from a small, heterogeneous urban floodplain wetland park
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions and carbon uptake in temperate freshwater wetlands act in opposing directions in the context of global radiative forcing. Large uncertainties exist for the rates of CH4 emissions making it difficult to determine the extent that CH4 emissions counteract the carbon sequestration of wetlands. Urban temperate wetlands are typically small and feature highly heterogeneous land cover, posing an additional challenge to determining their CH4 budget.The data analysis approach we introduce here combines two different CH4 flux measurement techniques to overcome scale and heterogeneity problems and determine the overall CH4 budget of a small, heterogeneous, urban wetland landscape. Temporally intermittent point measurements from non steady -state chambers provided information about patch-level heterogeneity of fluxes, while continuous, high temporal resolution flux measurements using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique provided information about the temporal dynamics of the fluxes. Patch-level scaling parameterization was developed from the chamber data to scale eddy covariance data to a 'fixed-frame', which corrects for variability in the spatial coverage of the eddy covariance observation footprint at any single point in time. By combining two measurement techniques at different scales, we addressed shortcomings of both techniques with respect to heterogeneous wetland sites.We determined that fluxes observed by the two methods are statistically similar in magnitude when brought to the same temporal and spatial scale. We also found that open-water and macrophyte-covered areas of the wetland followed similar phenological cycles and emitted nearly equivalent levels of CH4 for much of the year. However, vegetated wetland areas regularly exhibited a stronger late-summer emission peak, possibly due to CH4 transport through mature vegetation vascular systems. Normalizing the eddy covariance data to a fixed-frame allowed us to determine the seasonal CH4 budget of each patch and the overall site. Overall, the macrophyte areas had the largest CH4 fluxes followed by the open water areas.Uncertainties in the final CH4 budget included spatial heterogeneity of CH4 fluxes, the tower footprint, measurement in the data to be scaled, and gap-filling, Of these, the spatial placement of the chambers provided the largest source of uncertainty in CH4 estimates. This reinforces the need to utilize site-level measurements when estimating CH4 fluxes from wetlands as opposed to using only up-scaled point measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Drying effects on sorption capacity of coastal sediment: The importance of architecture and polarity of organic matter
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations on how desiccation changes sorption of organic compounds by salt marsh sediments provide insight into the physical and chemical properties of these wide-spread coastal sediments. We measured sorption of compounds with different polarities (lysine, tyrosine, naphthalene and aniline) onto natural sediments and sediments that were dried and rewetted. Sorption of lysine by marsh sediment decreased significantly when the sediment was dried using a freeze-drier, oven, or desiccator. and sorption capacity was not restored when sediments were rewetted. In contrast to lysine, the sorption capacity of more hydrophobic compounds (tyrosine, aniline and naphthalene) increased significantly after salt marsh sediment was dried. These results suggest that drying greatly increased sediment hydrophobicity. Consistently, water drop penetration time, an index of hydrophobicity, was significantly lower for combusted sediments than for those that were simply dried. Sediments treated with EDTA, or boiled in seawater, exhibited a similar or even greater reduction in lysine sorption capacity compared with sediments that were dried. Water retention capacity of salt marsh sediment decreased 50% after sediment was dried. The effects of pH and salinity on lysine sorption in wet and dry sediments suggest that carboxyl groups play a major role in lysine sorption through cation ion exchange, and drying may reduce access to carboxyl groups. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of organic matter, originating mainly from Spartina alterniflora, is an important factor controlling sorption capacity in salt marsh sediment. The drying process makes sedimentary organic matter change conformation, shrink in volume, and expose hydrophobic groups, thus becoming more hydrophobic. In environments with wet and dry cycles. the distribution of hydrophobic or hydrophilic compounds between solution and particulate phases could thus be influenced by the 3D structure and polarity of organic matter.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES

CP  - 9th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant
CL  - Guiyang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The effects of allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the growth and photosynthesis of Phaeodactylum tricornutum were investigated. P tricornutum incubated in f/2 medium was exposed to DOM additives, which were extracted from the plant and sediment samples of a salt marsh in North Branch of the Yangtze estuary, China. During 12 days incubation, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of P tricornutum were measured by a Phyto-PAM phytoplankton analyzer. Spectral properties of DOM in algae filtrates were also observed. The concentrations of chlorophyll a, active chlorophyll a, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II significantly decreased after four days of incubation, suggesting that the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of P tricornutum were inhibited. After adding sediment-DOM extract, both a(250)/a(365) (the ratio of the absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm) and S values (spectral slope coefficients) of algae filtrates declined in the first two days, which demonstrated a loss of low molecular weight DOM. Parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra of DOM in algae filtrates revealed that DOM could be classified into two humic-like and two protein-like components. The fluorescence intensity of tyrosine-like component originating from algae increased significantly during incubation. This study supports the hypothesis that allochthonous DOM derived from salt marsh plant and sediment have a strong influence on the adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Methane Emissions From the Salt Marshes of Donana Wetlands: Spatio-Temporal Variability and Controlling Factors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of methane in the atmosphere, but emissions in these ecosystems are still poorly quantified, as in situ data are limited. In this study, we present the first assessment of spatio-temporal changes in air-water CH4 fluxes in the salt marshes of the Donana wetlands (SW Spain), one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe, due to its high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The marshes are flooded by estuarine waters from the adjacent Guadalquivir River by tidal intrusion, which influences aquatic CH4 dynamics by changing salinity and water chemistry which affects sedimentary methanogenesis. During sixteen samplings, conducted between March 2016 and March 2018, surface water CH4 concentrations were measured using static-head space equilibration gas chromatography in seven sites representing salt marshes located in the land strip close to the estuary. Because of meteorological conditions and tide variations, salinity markedly changed across the salt marshes, although sites located closer to the river mouth could be categorized as polyhaline marshes whereas upstream sites formed a group of mesohaline marshes. The CH4 saturation range was 252-36,735% (average 5,170%) and 374-620,007% (average 31,541%) in polyhaline and mesohaline marshes, respectively, suggesting the inhibitory effect of sulfate on methanogenesis, although a linear trend between dissolved CH4 concentration and salinity was not observed. In contrast, water temperature and chlorophyll a were significantly and positively correlated with methane, indicating sedimentary methanogenesis control by temperature, and organic matter availability boosted by primary productivity. This does not exclude the possibility that some CH4 might also come from estuarine inputs. Air-water CH4 fluxes ranged from 2.6 to 720 mu mol m(-2)d(-1) (average 104 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) in the polyhaline marshes and from 5.6 to 12,715 mu mol m(-2)d(-1) (average 637 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) in the mesohaline marshes, with higher emissions measured during the summer months in all sites. Even though the strongest environmental drivers of dissolved CH4 accumulation seemed to be temperature and productivity, the spatio-temporal patterns observed suggest that methane dynamics in the Donana salt marshes are controlled by a mosaic of processes rather than by a single environmental force.

TI  - Carbon burial and storage in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats can be important sinks of organic carbon (C-org) and mitigate global warming by sequestering significant quantities of atmospheric CO2 and storing sedimentary Corg for long periods, although their Corg burial and storage capacity may be affected by on-going sea level rise and human intervention. Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Influence of natural rhizosediments characteristics on hydrocarbons degradation potential of microorganisms associated to Juncus maritimus roots
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of natural sediments colonized by Juncus maritimus (rhizosediments) on the microbial rhizosphere communities and their potential for hydrocarbons degradation was investigated. Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

TI  - Elucidation of the rhizosphere microbiome linked to Spartina alterniflora phenotype in a salt marsh on Skidaway Island, Georgia, USA
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, dominates salt marshes on the east coast of the United States. While the physicochemical cues affecting S. alterniflora productivity have been studied intensively, the role of plant-microbe interactions in ecosystem functioning remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study, the effects of S. alterniflora phenotype on the composition of archaeal, bacterial, diazotrophic and fungal communities were investigated. Overall, prokaryotic communities were more diverse and bacteria were more abundant in the areas colonized by the tall plant phenotype in comparison to those of short plant phenotype. Diazotrophic methanogens (Methanomicrobia) preferentially colonized the area of the short plant phenotype. Putative iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria and sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacteria were identified as indicator species in the rhizosphere of tall and short plant phenotypes, respectively. Finally, while diazotrophic populations shaped microbial interactions in the areas colonized by the tall plant phenotype, fungal populations filled this role in the areas occupied by the short plant phenotype. The results here demonstrate that S. alterniflora phenotype and proximity to the root zone are selective forces dictating microbial community assembly. Results further reveal that reduction-oxidation chemistry is a major factor driving the selection of belowground microbial populations in salt marsh habitats.

TI  - An innovative of aerobic bio-entrapped salt marsh sediment membrane reactor for the treatment of high-saline pharmaceutical wastewater
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel bio-entrapped salt marsh sediment membrane reactor (BESMSMR) was evaluated for treating high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater, and membrane fouling behaviour was also assessed. The BESMSMR was operated in parallel with a conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR), and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) as well as an entrapped biomass MBR (bio-entrapped membrane reactor, BEMR) to facilitate a meaningful comparison of performance characteristics obtained in these reactor systems. Two hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 60 and 40,h with organic loading rates (OLRs) varied from 7.0 to 11.9 kg COD/m(3) d were tested. The pharmaceutical wastewater used has an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of 17,931 1851 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 20,881 2030 mg/L. The BESMSMR demonstrated the highest removal efficiencies of TCOD (78.481.3%), due to the ability of the marine sediment microorganisms seeded from coastal shores to thrive in the hyper-saline environment and degraded recalcitrant organic matter present in the pharmaceutical wastewater. The anoxic zone presented in the inner part of bio-carriers could have triggered the denitrification reaction, and thus improved the TN removal rate by 15-20%. Membrane fouling was reduced with lower concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the entrapped biomass MBRs. Proteins rather than carbohydrates were the main component of EPS and SMP in the MBR systems. The novel BESMSMR possesses the benefits of salt marsh sediment and an entrapped biomass technique that offered effective organic removal for the high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater and reduced membrane fouling.

TI  - Assessment of the molecular composition of particulate organic matter exchanged between the Saeftinghe salt marsh (southwestern Netherlands) and the adjacent water system
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study the chemical composition of seston, transported by tidal water between an estuarine salt marsh and the adjacent water system, was assessed. The analytical techniques used are Pyrolysis in combination with Gas Chromatography and/or Mass Spectrometry. Interpretation of the Py-MS data was aided by discriminant analysis.The presented results indicate that throughout the year a dominant refractory fraction is present in the seston, but that seasonal additions can be distinguished, Apart from this seasonal pattern, differences between ebb and flood can be visualized by the use of discriminant analysis. During summertime, flood seston is enriched with lipids and recently synthesized polysaccharides, while during the rest of the year the flood tide samples contain more (remains of) lignin and polysaccharides than their ebb tide counterparts, The lignin markers comprise only fragments with extremely altered (reduced) character,These results, which highlight the molecular composition of the exchanged seston but do not offer exact quantitative budget estimations, provide no evidence for export of lignin-rich particulate halophytic material from the marsh to the water system. On the contrary, based on seston compositions, the water system seems to supply lignin-rich particles to the marsh during a considerable part of the year.

TI  - Decomposition and nutrient release in halophytes of a Mediterranean salt marsh
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study dealt with the decomposition and nutrient release from the halophytes Atriplex portulacoides, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Limoniastrum monopetalum, and Spartina densiflora, the dominant species in the Castro Marim salt marsh, Portugal. Environmental effects on decomposition were also assessed. The study was carried out for one year using the in situ litterbag technique. S. densiflora showed a lower decomposition rate (k = 0.003 day(-1)) than the other study species (k = 0.005-0.009). Study species showed similar decomposition patterns, that is, the weight loss mostly occurred during the autumn-winter period (study beginning in November). This indicates that temperature in this period did not hamper the decomposition process. The decomposition rate was positively affected by the initial N concentration (r(2) = 0.87, P < 0.05) and negatively by the C:N ratio (r(2) = 0.86, P < 0.05) in decomposing materials. At the end of the study, S. densiflora and L. monopetalum, the species with lower initial N concentrations, retained much higher proportion of initial N (89-109%) than the others (5-14%). Also, S. densiflora with the lowest P concentration retained higher proportion of initial P (48%) than the others (5-20%). Release of K and Mg were also slower from S. densiflora and was associated with their initial low concentration in this species. The lowest Mn release was observed from A. macrostachyum and also in relation to the lowest initial concentration. Our study supports the hypothesis that decomposition patterns of marsh species are mostly associated with differences regarding their morphology and chemical composition. Given the higher resistance of S. densiflora to decomposition, its progressive spreading may result in accumulation of organic detritus overtime in invaded salt marshes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Plant trait-environment relationships in salt marshes: Deviations from predictions by ecological concepts
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are exposed to high groundwater levels and salinity due to periodical inundation and are under constant influence of physical disturbance. Plants inhabiting salt marshes need to pursue different strategies to colonize this environment and hence, trait expressions should vary along the elevation gradient from pioneer zone to upper salt marsh. We verified various trait-environment concepts for their applicability to different salt marshes zones, and found some are opposite to that of other terrestrial plants.We used RLQ to analyse the joint structure between environmental conditions (R-table) and species traits (Q-table) by use of a species abundance table (L-table). RLQ analyses the inertia of scores of R- and Q-table linked by species scores of L-table. Then we clustered species according to their position along the RLQ axes to form functional groups.The 'physiological-ecological-amplitude' concept could not be confirmed from the trait perspective, as the species of the 'stressful' lower marsh show trait values indicating higher competitive ability (canopy height and stem mass fraction) than those of the 'benign' upper parts. Also, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of salt marsh plants were more constrained by a salt-waterlogging gradient than by a nutrient gradient. This is opposite to the leaf economics spectrum, which describes a trade-off from fast growing species with the potential of quick return of investments of nutrients to species with long leaf lifetime and low rates of photosynthesis. Our results are consistent with the theory of functional equilibrium and Tilman's allocation model, which is a shift in allocation to plant organs responsible for capturing limiting resources resulting in higher fractions of that organ relative to the whole plant body.

AB  - Whether aquatic animals rely primarily for sustenance upon vascular macrophytes or attached algae has been often debated. A compilation of carbon isotope data from the literature for coastal seagrass meadows, estuarine salt marshes, and freshwater lakes and rivers indicates that animal delta(13)C values more closely approximate those of attached algae than they do those of vascular plants. This empirical synthesis supports results from individual studies in suggesting that macrophytes are unlikely to play an exclusive and direct dietary role in aquatic foodwebs.

AB  - Radium isotopes provide unique and important information concerning water exchange in a salt marsh-tidal creek system. Seasonal radium data collected over five tidal cycles from a creek draining a South Carolina salt marsh, radium and thorium data from the adjacent marsh sediments, and interstitial water radium data from the drainage basin are modeled to yield residence times of water in the upper 10 cm of the marsh sediments ranging from less than one to twenty-six hours. Water residence times derived from chambers which directly measure the flux of Ra isotopes to the creek waters agree well with these calculated interstitial water turnover times.Dissolved radium activities in the tidal creek were greater during the summer than during other times of the year. We suspect that seasonal changes in the storage of organic carbon and rates of bioturbation lead to net reduction of radium carrier phases in the marsh sediments during the summer.

TI  - Methane emission from tidal freshwater marshes
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In two tidal freshwater marshes, methane emission, production and accumulation in the pore-water have been studied. The two sites differ in their dominant vegetation, i.e., reed and bulrush, and in their heights above sea level. The reed site was elevated in relation to the bulrush site and had higher rates of methane emission and production. It is argued that this difference in methane emission between sites was primarily due to a different effect of reed and bulrush plants on methane dynamics rather than methane oxidation related to tidal elevation. Methane emission showed strong seasonality related primarily to plant physiology and only secondarily to temperature. Two control sites at which vegetation was removed systematically had lower emission rates indicating an overall stimulating effect of plants on methane emission from tidal marshes. Flooding reduced methane emission, probably by blocking the primary sites of methane release in the lower part of the plant stems.

TI  - Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on saltmarsh nitrogen removal in the Yangtze River Estuary, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

TI  - Detecting the Morphology of Prograding and Retreating Marsh Margins-Example of a Mega-Tidal Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retreat and progradation make the edges of salt marsh platforms their most active features. If we have a single topographic snapshot of a marsh, is it possible to tell if some areas have retreated or prograded recently or if they are likely to do so in the future? We explore these questions by characterising marsh edge topography in mega-tidal Moricambe Bay (UK) in 2009, 2013 and 2017. We first map outlines of marsh platform edges based on lidar data and from these we generate transverse topographic profiles of the marsh edge 10 m long and 20 m apart. By associating profiles with individual retreat or progradation events, we find that they produce distinct profiles when grouped by change event, regardless of event magnitude. Progradation profiles have a shallow scarp and low relief that decreases with event magnitude, facilitating more progradation. Conversely, steep-scarped, high-relief retreat profiles dip landward as retreat reveals older platforms. Furthermore, vertical accretion of the marsh edge is controlled by elevation rather than its lateral motion, suggesting an even distribution of deposition that would allow bay infilling were it not limited by the migration of creeks. While we demonstrate that marsh edges can be quantified with currently available DTMs, oblique observations are crucial to fully describe scarps and better inform their sensitivity to wave and current erosion.

TI  - Differences in relative air humidity affect responses to soil salinity in freshwater and salt marsh populations of the dominant grass species Phragmites australis
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity diminishes the dominance of species and affects their distribution. Phragmites australis is a dominant ecosystem engineer with broad distribution, high intraspecific variation and great socio-economic importance. Coastal ecosystems inhabited by P. australis are threatened by salinization. Here, we investigated salinity tolerance of freshwater and salt marsh population of the species, grown under two soil salinities and in two common gardens. Salinity significantly affected the growth, biomass, leaf physiological parameters and ion concentration. Climate altered morphology and ion concentration of P. australis. In contrast to our hypothesis, the salt marsh population was not more salt tolerant than the freshwater population, and both showed a low degree of salt stress, maintaining their photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration, and only showing small decreases in biomass and height when salt-treated. We therefore ruled out local adaptation to soil salinity. Instead, both populations acclimated by phenotypic plasticity of biomass, root: shoot ratio, stomatal conductance and ion content. The salinity tolerance strategy of both populations was ion concentration by tissue desiccation, which was most efficient in the drier climate common garden. Hence, plants utilizing tissue desiccation as salinity tolerance strategy will have an advantage in areas where climate change leads to drier air humidity.

TI  - Fluorescence and DOC contents of estuarine pore waters from colonized and non-colonized sediments: Effects of sampling preservation
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Halimione portulacoides was evaluated by analysing the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in sediment pore waters from a salt marsh at different depths. Cores of sediments at colonized and non-colonized sites were collected from a coastal lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). The DOC content of extracted pore waters was determined and characterized by synchronous molecular fluorescence (Delta lambda = 60 nm) and UV-visible spectroscopies. The common practice of freezing sediment cores for further and later chemical investigation was shown not to be an appropriate methodology of sample preservation. On the contrary, freezing of extracted and filtered pore water seemed not to affect either the DOC content or the fluorescence properties of pore waters. Two types of fluorescent substances were found in the pore waters spectra; one corresponding to humic-like substances and another one resembling proteins. However, major differences were found in the spectra of pore waters depending on both depth and the presence/absence of vegetation colonization. (c) 2006 Ellsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth and physiological responses of Scirpus mariqueter to extremely high temperatures.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events are becoming more and more frequent in the context of global climate change, but we know little about the responses of salt marsh plants to extreme weather conditions. In this study, a 7 -day controlled greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the response of growth, physiology and photosynthetic parameters of Scirpus mariqueter, a typical estuary salt marsh plant species, to extremely high temperatures (40, 45, 50 C). Results showed that high temperature (45 50 C) significantly enhanced the root to shoot ratio of S. mariqueter and that more biomass was allocated to underground to cope with the damage induced by the high temperature. The content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll decreased with the increases of temperature, indicating that high temperature inhibited the synthesis of chlorophylls. High temperature stress affected the physiology of S. mariqueter, malondialdehyde content in leaves and roots decreased significantly when exposed to high temperature (45 50 C), which indicates that S. mariqueter has a certain heat tolerance. The content of proline was significantly higher in high temperature treatment (40-50 C) than in control, soluble sugar content decreased significantly in leaves and increased in roots, suggesting that the osmotic adjustment substances produced by S. mariqueter were active in resisting stress. Compared with that in control, net photosynthesis rate of S. mariqueter increased at 40 C, but decreased significantly at 45 and 50 C, accompanied by the decreases of stomata' conductivity, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency, suggesting that photosynthesis rate of S. mariqueter can be promoted under a certain range of high temperature but be inhibited under extremely high temperature. Stomata' restriction was found to be the major limiting factor. Our results can provide a reference for understanding the adaptation mechanism of salt marsh plants to extremely high temperature in the context of climate change.

TI  - Early responses of Bassia diffusa (Thunb.) Kuntze to submergence for different salinity treatments
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Early responses of the salt marsh succulent Bassia diffusa (Thunb.) Kuntze to combined salinity and submergence were studied in a laboratory experiment aimed at determining the pattern of the response of photosynthetic pigments, membrane stability, oxalic acid and water relations to these stressors. Three key stages in the response were identified. A drop in chlorophyll a + b within 6 h (4.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 mg g(-1) DM) with a corresponding increase in carotenoid concentration (0.6 +/- 0.1 mg g(-1) DM) indicated an immediate response to submergence. Oxalic acid concentration was highest on Day 4(1.7 g g(-1) DM) as opposed to control levels, indicative of its role in submergence tolerance, thus Day 4 may be the peak of positive acclimation. The third phase was marked by a sharp increase in electrolyte leakage to 47.5 +/- 2.6% on Day 10, from 9.4 +/- 1.4% on Day 7, with a corresponding decrease in total dissolved solutes between Days 7 and 10. Results suggest that oxalic acid accumulates under submergence possibly as a stabilising osmolyte. The threshold for tolerance of the species under submergence is 7 days with membrane damage thereafter. B. diffusa would not survive prolonged submergence (>7 days) but could survive submergence of short duration (<7 days) through continuous underwater photosynthesis, accumulation of osmolytes such as oxalic acid and carotenoid, and maintenance of relative water content and succulence within control levels. These data show that this upper intertidal salt marsh plant would be sensitive to prolonged inundation as a result of sea level rise or due to estuary mouth closure and a subsequent rise in water level.

TI  - Short-term Effect of Nitrogen Addition on Litter and Soil Properties in Calamagrostis angustifolia Freshwater Marshes of Northeast China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) addition can affect soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition by enhancing soil enzyme activity, increasing labile organic carbon (C) fractions and decreasing litter C/N ratio. This study was designed to investigate the short-term effect of N addition on litter and soil chemical and biological properties in Calamagrostis angustifolia freshwater marshes. A field experiment was conducted in which soil was treated with N addition of 0 (N0), 12 (N1), and 24 (N2) g N m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Above-ground biomass increased by 40 % and 32 % for N1 and N2 treatment, respectively. Added N increased litter C and N concentrations as well as beta-glucosidase and invertase activities. However, litter C/N ratio decreased with N addition. N1 treatment increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in both topsoil and subsoil, but no changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were observed. Total N concentrations in subsoil increased both in N1 and N2 treatments; NH4 (+)-N decreased in the N1 treatment, while NO3 (-)-N increased in the N2 treatment in topsoil. N2 treatment increased beta-glucosidase, invertase, and urease activities in both soil layers. The differences in litter and soil characteristics caused by N addition suggest that N addition has the capacity to increase soil C transformation rates in marshland.

TI  - Effects of soil abiotic factors on the plant morphology in an intertidal salt marsh, Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant morphology plays important role in studying biogeography in many ecosystems. Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa. Thus, we recommend managers help alleviate soil abiotic stresses in the intertidal salt marshes, making the soil conditions more suitable for S. salsa growth and succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Determination of Trophic Transfer at a Created Intertidal Oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) Reef in the Yangtze River Estuary Using Stable Isotope Analyses
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oysters can create reefs that provide habitat for associated species resulting in elevated resident abundances, lower mortality rates, and increased growth and survivorship compared to other estuarine habitats. However, there is a need to quantify trophic relationships and transfer at created oyster reefs to provide a better understanding of their potential in creating suitable nekton habitat. Stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were conducted to examine the organic matter sources and potential energy flow pathways at a created intertidal oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis; hereinafter, oyster) reef and adjacent salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The delta C-13 values of most reef-associated species (22 of 37) were intermediate between those of suspended particle organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMI), indicating that both POM and BMI are the major organic matter sources at the created oyster reef. The sessile and motile macrofauna colonizing the reef make up the main prey of transient nekton (e. g., spotted sea bass, Asian paddle crab, and green mud crab), thus suggesting that the associated community was most important in supporting higher trophic levels as opposed to the direct dietary subsidy of oysters. The created oyster reef consistently supported higher trophic levels than the adjacent salt marsh habitat due to the dominance of secondary consumers. These results indicate that through the provision of habitat for associated species, created oyster reefs provide suitable habitat and support a higher average trophic level than adjacent salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary.

TI  - Salt marsh sediment characteristics as key regulators on the efficiency of hydrocarbons bioremediation by Juncus maritimus rhizospheric bacterial community
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation of petroleum hydrocarbons was investigated during a 5-month greenhouse experiment, to assess the rhizoremediation (RR) potential in sediments with different characteristics colonized by Juncus maritimus, a salt marsh plant commonly found in temperate estuaries. Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.

TI  - Hydrogen Cyanide Accumulation and Transformations in Non-polluted Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - While cyanide is known to be produced by many organisms, including plants, bacteria, algae, fungi and some animals, it is generally thought that high levels of cyanide in aquatic systems require anthropogenic sources. Here, we report accumulation of relatively high levels of cyanide in non-polluted salt marsh sediments (up to 230 mu mol kg(-1)). Concentrations of free cyanide up to 1.92 mu mol L-1, which are toxic to aquatic life, were detected in the pore-waters. Concentration of total (free and complexed) cyanide in the pore-waters was up to 6.94 mu mol L-1. Free cyanide, which is released to the marsh sediments, is attributed to processes associated with decomposition of cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, roots and possibly from other sources. This cyanide is rapidly complexed with iron and adsorbed on sedimentary organic matter. The ultimate cyanide sink is, however, associated with formation of thiocyanate by reaction with products of sulfide oxidation by Fe(III) minerals, especially polysulfides. The formation of thiocyanate by this pathway detoxifies two poisonous compounds, polysulfides and hydrogen cyanide, preventing release of free hydrogen cyanide from salt marsh sediments into overlying water or air.

TI  - The Role of Sediment Dynamics for Inorganic Accretion Patterns in Southern California's Mediterranean-Climate Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh resilience to sea-level rise depends on marsh plain elevation, tidal range, subsurface processes, as well as surface accretion, of which suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) is a critical component. However, spatial and temporal patterns of inorganic sedimentation are poorly quantified within and across Salicornia pacifica (pickleweed)dominated marshes. We compared vertical accretion rates and re-examined previously published suspended-sediment patterns during dry-weather periods at Seal Beach Wetlands, which is characterized by a mix of Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) and pickleweed, and for Mugu Lagoon, where cordgrass is rare. Mugu Lagoon occurs higher in the tidal frame and receives terrigenous sediment from an adjacent creek. Feldspar marker horizons were established in winter 2013-2014 to measure accretion. Accretion rates at Seal Beach Wetlands and Mugu Lagoon were 6 +/- 0.5 mm/year (mean +/- SE) and 2 +/- 0.3 mm/year. Also, the estimated sediment flux (g/year) across the random feldspar plots was 3.5 times higher at Seal Beach Wetlands. At Mugu Lagoon, accretion was higher near creeks, although not statistically significant. Dry-weather SSC showed similar concentrations at transect locations across sites. During wet weather, however, SSC at Mugu Lagoon increased at all locations, with concentrations decaying farther than 8 m from tidal creek edge. Based on these results from Mugu Lagoon, we conclude accretion patterns are set by infrequent large flooding events in systems where there is a watershed sediment source. Higher accretion rates at Seal Beach Wetlands may be linked to lower-marsh elevations, and thus more frequent inundation, compared with Mugu Lagoon.

TI  - Nutrient subsidies from nekton in salt marsh intertidal creeks
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Motile organisms are thought to play a role in biogeochemical cycles in tidal systems, but few studies have addressed links between animal activities and dissolved nutrients. Our observations and experiments indicated that movements, feeding, and excretion by fishes and shrimps resulted in subsidies of NH4+ and PO43- to intertidal salt marsh creeks. During low tide, isolated pools inhabited by nekton became biogeochemical hotspots with up to fivefold increases in water column nutrient concentrations. In field experiments, simultaneous measurements in artificial pools and an adjacent natural intertidal pool demonstrated that nekton were sources of NH4+ during day and night, contributing 17-109% of the net increase in NH4+ and 3-18% of the PO43- in the natural intertidal pool. Nekton residing in intertidal pools generated the equivalent of 5% of the total NH4+ imported to the creek. At night, nekton in pools contributed the equivalent of 12% of the NH4+ and 4% of the PO43- imported from the subtidal channel. As the tide flooded the intertidal creek, nutrient enriched pool water was pulsed up the creek and into the intertidal basin. Tidally controlled patterns of nekton movements and feeding result in retention and reintroduction of nutrients to the upper reaches of intertidal creek basins. Accordingly, nekton contribute to the recycling of nutrients through a positive feedback loop that may enhance primary production and invertebrate prey within salt marsh creek basins. We conclude that nekton can be important and underappreciated contributors of dissolved nutrients in tidal systems.

TI  - Effect of dominant Spartina species on salt marsh detritus production in SW Atlantic estuaries
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Two cordgrass species of the genus Spartina cohabit in SW Atlantic (southern Brazil 31 degrees 48' S to Argentinean Patagonia, 43 degrees 20' S) salt marshes. Some salt marshes are dominated by the dense-flowered cordgrass Spartina densiflora (which inhabits the upper intertidal level) and others by the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (which inhabits the lower intertidal level). We investigated how the different species dominance affects the detritus dynamics in the Bahia Blanca estuary (38 degrees 47' S. 62 degrees 20' W Argentina). Field measurements of annual detritus production using destructive methods show that both plants are similar. However, detritus of S. alterniflora shows higher decomposition rates than that of S. densiflora. This difference may be due to a larger N content, lower lignocellulose content and lower C/N ratio of S. alterniflora when compared with S. densiflora. Moreover, field sampling shows that S. alterniflora has a larger amount of trapped litter that, according to the litterbag method, has higher decomposition rates. Therefore it is highly likely that S. alterniflora salt marshes contribute towards more profitable detritus for estuarine food webs than marshes dominated by S. densiflora. These results illustrate that the composition of the coastal plant community can determine the quality and profitability of the detritus that support estuarine food webs. They also illustrate that salt marshes belonging to a same biogeographic group and even coexisting in great proximity can have very different ecosystemic roles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Combination of biomolecular and stable isotope techniques to determine the origin of organic matter used by bacterial communities: application to sediment
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural isotopic composition is a good tool to trace organic matter in ecosystems. Recent studies used a combination of molecular and stable isotope techniques to determine the origin of the organic carbon used by bacteria in the water column. In our study, we show that this procedure can be used for analysis of sediment bacterial communities with few modifications. In the water column, bacterial recovery is done before DNA extraction. In the sediment, we tested qualitatively and quantitatively a direct and indirect extraction of DNA. The direct extraction was the most efficient. It recovered between 3.1 and 15.8 mu g DNA g(-1). dry sediment and the contamination of field samples by eucaryotic DNA was less than 13%. In this preliminary study of the salt marsh ecosystem, the delta(13)C values of DNA (-26 to -24 parts per thousand) recovered from the sediment were close to the delta(13)C values of halophytic plants (-26.4 and -25.3 parts per thousand) showing a relationship between plants and microorganisms, Thus, this procedure can be used to trace the flow of carbon through the sediment microbial biomass and to understand the variation of bacterial activity according to the inputs of allocthonous and autochtonous organic matter.

AB  - Vegetation pattern, soil attributes, and salinity regimes along with several other environmental factors were studied in a small (11 ha) but unmodified estuary in south Westland, New Zealand. Part of an unmodified 40 km(2) catchment within the South-west New Zealand World Heritage Area, the Hapuka Estuary, formed behind a 5-km long barrier beach, provides considerable ecological value as well as baseline, conservation advocacy and educative potentials both in a national and international context. Seventy-four quadrats were sampled randomly along five transects at right angles to the main Hapuka River. Eight plant communities comprising 141 native and thirteen exotic vascular species, were differentiated using multivariate analyses, from bare mud (mean elevation 1.23 +/- 0.24 m above Mean Low Water Spring (MLWS)), saltmarsh and shrubland associations through to the adjacent podocarp-broadleaved rain forest (4.53 +/- 0.74 m above MLWS). Bulk density of the upper 10 cm of substrate varied from a maximum of 1.15 g cm(-3) in the lowest elevation association to a minimum of 0.15 g cm(-3) in the rain forest. pH showed a similar trend with values of 6.97 and 4.31, respectively. The reverse pattern was evident with organic matter, with the highest content (53% ODWt) in the rain forest substrate. The water which irrigates the saltmarsh at high tide reaches 15-19 parts per thousand salinity on calm days but may be much less saline when moderate to strong southerly winds counter the tidal influence. Northerly winds, or a southern outlet through the barrier beach, intermittently evident in the past, are likely to enhance salinity of the tidal waters across the saltmarsh.Ordination of the vegetation samples indicated a very strong gradient associated with Axis 1 (eigenvalue=0.872) and Axis 2 (eigenvalue=0.461). Vector fitting of nine measured environmental factors indicated a strong positive correlation with Axis 1 of the ordination, of soil pH, sodium and conductivity, and negative correlations with elevation, soil water, organic matter and potassium contents.

TI  - In Situ Burning Restores the Ecological Function and Structure of an Oil-Impacted Coastal Marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the use of in situ burning for oil spill remediation in coastal wetlands accelerates, the capacity of this procedure to restore the ecological structure and function of oil-impacted wetlands becomes increasingly important. Thus, our research focused on evaluating the functional and structural recovery of a coastal marsh in South Louisiana to an in situ burn following a Hurricane Katrina-induced oil spill. Permanent sampling plots were set up to monitor marsh recovery in the oiled and burned areas as well as non-oiled and non-burned (reference) marshes. Plots were monitored for species composition, stem density, above- and belowground productivity, marsh resiliency, soil chemistry, soil residual oil, and organic matter decomposition. The burn removed the majority of the oil from the marsh, and structurally the marsh recovered rapidly. Plant biomass and species composition returned to control levels within 9 months; however, species richness remained somewhat lower in the oiled and burned areas compared to the reference areas. Recovery of ecological function was also rapid following the in situ burn. Aboveground and belowground plant productivity recovered within one growing season, and although decomposition rates were initially higher in the oiled areas, over time they became equivalent to those in reference sites. Also, marsh resiliency, i.e., the rate of recovery from our applied disturbances, was not affected by the in situ burn. We conclude that in situ burning is an effective way to remove oil and allow ecosystem recovery in coastal marshes.

TI  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Enhances CO2 Exchange Rates in Freshwater Marsh Ecosystems in the Florida Everglades
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research examines the relationships between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), water level, precipitation patterns and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange rates in the freshwater wetland ecosystems of the Florida Everglades. Data was obtained over a 5-year study period (2009-2013) from two freshwater marsh sites located in Everglades National Park that differ in hydrology. At the short-hydroperiod site (Taylor Slough; TS) and the long-hydroperiod site (Shark River Slough; SRS) fluctuations in precipitation patterns occurred with changes in ENSO phase, suggesting that extreme ENSO phases alter Everglades hydrology which is known to have a substantial influence on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Variations in both ENSO phase and annual net CO2 exchange rates co-occurred with changes in wet and dry season length and intensity. Combined with site-specific seasonality in CO2 exchanges rates, El Nino and La Nina phases magnified season intensity and CO2 exchange rates at both sites. At TS, net CO2 uptake rates were higher in the dry season, whereas SRS had greater rates of carbon sequestration during the wet season. As La Nina phases were concurrent with drought years and extended dry seasons, TS became a greater sink for CO2 on an annual basis (-11 to -110 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to El Nino and neutral years (-5 to -43.5 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). SRS was a small source for CO2 annually (1.81 to 80 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) except in one exceptionally wet year that was associated with an El Nino phase (-16 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). Considering that future climate predictions suggest a higher frequency and intensity in El Nino and La Nina phases, these results indicate that changes in extreme ENSO phases will significantly alter CO2 dynamics in the Florida Everglades.

TI  - An assessment of the heavy metal pollution of two tidal marshes on the north-west coast of Ireland
T2  - BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of heavy metal concentrations was performed on two sheltered littoral locations on the north-west coast of Ireland, encompassing the tidal flat, eroded tidal marsh edge and backmarsh/supratidal settings. Both sites possess catchments devoid of major industries, allowing an indication of regional pollution levels to be approximated. Profiles of heavy metal concentrations were interpreted by considering diagenetic effects, with conclusions supported by grain size and organic carbon determinations, An increase in heavy metal concentrations landwards was observed, resultant upon increased organic components in the sediment and a dominance of metal-humic complexes. Concentrations of lead, copper, zinc, chromium and manganese were found to be relatively low for both sites, although an increase in anthropogenic input in recent sediments was implied. Both sites were also dated radiometrically. The dates calculated helped to show that the tidal marshes of north-western Ireland have not yet been anthropogenically modified to the point of toxicity.

TI  - Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Rhizosphere of a Spartina-Dominated Salt Marsh Systems
T2  - AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the presence of a metastable mixture of Fe(II), O-2, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in sediment pore water in organic carbon-rich sediments in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh systems. Field measurements at two different estuarine sites in South Carolina (one heavily urbanized and a protected research reserve) showed a broad region of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production more than 15 cm below the sediment surface within and immediately adjacent to the rhizospheres of S. alterniflora. Dissolved Fe(II) was positively correlated with hydrogen peroxide indicating a possible abiotic pathway to ROS production (r (2) = 0.94). The null hypothesis was tested that Fe(II) inventories were maintained by protective ligands and thus unreactive with respect to O-2 consumption and ROS production. The addition of an Fe-binding ligand, DTPA, resulted in rapid decline of ROS in pore water, indicating that Fe(II) was labile. The half-life of superoxide under the measured solution conditions was calculated and found to be less than a second. The combination of high lability and persistent ROS was interpreted to indicate a high rate of Fe(II) and O-2 supply to the pore water. The Ra-224/Th-228 disequilibrium was measured to determine the potential for advective mass transfer of dissolved oxygen via pore water exchange. The estimated pore water exchange of 54 L m(-2) day(-1) was significant but could not support the measured production of ROS alone, the direct exchange of O-2 from the S. alterniflora root system may have contributed significantly to ROS production in the sediments.

TI  - Simultaneous measurements of dissolved CH4 and H-2 in wetland soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeochemical processes in wetland soils are complex and are driven by a microbiological community that competes for resources and affects the soil chemistry. Depending on the availability of various electron acceptors, the high carbon input to wetland soils can make them important sources of methane production and emissions. There are two significant pathways for methanogenesis : acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The hydrogenotrophic pathway is dependent on the availability of dissolved hydrogen gas (H-2), and there is significant competition for available H-2. This study presents simultaneous measurements of dissolved methane and H-2 over a 2-year period at three tidal marshes in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Methane reservoirs show a significant correlation with dissolved organic carbon, temperature, and methane emissions, whereas the H-2 concentrations measured with dialysis samplers do not show significant relationships with these field variables. Data presented in this study show that increased dissolved H-2 reservoirs in wetland soils correlate with decreased methane reservoirs, which is consistent with studies that have shown that elevated levels of H-2 inhibit methane production by inhibiting propionate fermentation, resulting in less acetate production and hence decreasing the contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the overall production of methane.

TI  - Low persistence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis spores in four mosquito biotopes of a salt marsh in southern france
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the persistence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) in a typical breeding site of the mosquito Ochlerotatus caspius in a particularly sensitive salt marsh ecosystem following two Bti-based larvicidal applications (Vectobac (R) 12AS, 1.95 L/ha). The treated area was composed of four larval biotopes that differed in terms of the most representative plant species (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Phragmites australis, and Juncus maritimus) and the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil. We sampled water, soil, and plants at various times before and after the applications (from spring to autumn, 2001) and quantified the spores of B. thuringiensis (Bt) and Bacillus species. The B. cereus group accounted for between 0% and 20% of all Bacillus spp. before application depending on the larval biotope. No Bti were found before application. The variation in the quantity of bacilli during the mosquito breeding season depended more on the larval biotope than on the season or the larvicidal application. More bacilli were found in soil (10(4)-10(6) spores/g) than on plant samples (10(2)-10(4) spores/g). The abundance in water (10(5) to 10(7) spores/L) appeared to be correlated to the water level of the breeding site. The number of Bti spores increased just after application, after declining; no spores were detected in soil or water 3 months after application. However, low numbers of Bti spores were present on foliage from three of the four studied plant strata. In conclusion, the larvicidal application has very little impact on Bacillus spp. flora after one breeding season (two applications).

TI  - A blueprint for blue carbon: toward an improved understanding of the role of vegetated coastal habitats in sequestering CO2
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed "blue carbon". Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.

TI  - Tidal marshes as a source of optically and chemically distinctive colored dissolved organic matter in the Chesapeake Bay
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of tidal marshes as a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for adjacent estuarine waters was studied in the Rhode River subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. Water in a tidal creek draining brackish, high-elevation marshes was sampled every hour during several semidiurnal tidal cycles in order to examine the tidal exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Water leaving the marsh during ebbing tide was consistently enriched in DOC compared to water entering the marsh during flooding tide. There was a net DOC export from the marsh to the estuary during seasons of both low and high marsh plant biomass. Optical analysis demonstrated that, in addition to contributing to the carbon budgets, the marsh had a strong influence on the estuary's CDOM dynamics. Marsh-exported CDOM had optical properties that were consistently and markedly different from those of CDOM in the adjacent estuary. Specifically, marsh CDOM had: (1) considerably stronger absorption, (2) larger DOC-specific absorption, (3) lower exponential spectral slope, (4) larger fluorescence signal, (5) lower fluorescence per unit absorbance, and (6) higher fluorescence at wavelengths >400 nm. These optical characteristics are indicative of relatively complex, high-molecular-weight, aromatic-rich DOM, and this was confirmed by results of molecular-weight-distribution analysis. Our findings illustrate the importance of tidal marshes as sources of optically and chemically distinctive dissolved organic compounds, and their influence on CDOM dynamics, DOC budgets, and, thus, photochemical and biogeochemical processes, in adjacent estuarine ecosystems.

TI  - Functional and ecophysiological traits of Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis ecotypes in Mediterranean salt marshes under different tidal exposures
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to discuss the functional and ecophysiological traits of two abundant succulent halophytes in Mediterranean salt marsh systems, considering two ecotypes differing on their tidal exposure. In Halimione portulacoides the higher root/shoot (R/S) biomass ratio verified in low inundation frequency (LF) marshes, as compared with that in high inundation frequency (HF), indicates an optimal partitioning strategy, inducing differential allocation patterns along with varying environmental factors. Conversely, Sarcocornia perennis appear to have an isometric allocation strategy, based on intrinsic biomass allocation mechanisms independent from the surrounding environmental conditions. Similarly, the photosynthetic traits appear to reflect the intrinsic ecology of the species. Sarcocornia perennis habitat adaptation to HF conditions is clearly revealed by its high photosynthetic efficiency under HF conditions. On the other hand, the cosmopolitan H. portulacoides shows no differences between ecotypes, in which concerns this trait, mostly due to the high carotenoid content of the HF ecotype, which allows this specie to counteract the stress generated during submersion. Additionally, anti-oxidant enzymatic activities revealed that S. perennis presents a high degree of stress tolerance under HF conditions, while H. portulacoides is highly adapted to LF conditions. These functional (biomass-related) and physiological traits determine the optimal habitats for H. portulacoides and S. perennis. While H. portulacoides optimal biomass partitioning, along with its efficient anti-oxidant defence system, makes this species fitter to LF conditions, S. perennis isometric allocation strategy, along with a higher photosynthetic efficiency under frequent flooding conditions, provides this species the mechanisms to efficiently colonize the intertidal habitat.

TI  - Responses of stomatal features and photosynthesis to porewater N enrichment and elevated atmospheric CO2 in Phragmites australis, the common reed
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - PREMISE Biological invasions increasingly threaten native biodiversity and ecosystem services. One notable example is the common reed, Phragmites australis, which aggressively invades North American salt marshes. Elevated atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen pollution enhance its growth and facilitate invasion because P. australis responds more strongly to these enrichments than do native species. We investigated how modifications to stomatal features contribute to strong photosynthetic responses to CO2 and nitrogen enrichment in P. australis by evaluating stomatal shifts under experimental conditions and relating them to maximal stomatal conductance (g(wmax)) and photosynthetic rates.METHODS Plants were grown in situ in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and porewater nitrogen (N-enr) in a Chesapeake Bay tidal marsh. We measured light-saturated carbon assimilation rates (A(sat)) and stomatal characteristics, from which we calculated g(wmax) and determined whether CO2 and N-enr altered the relationship between g(wmax) and A(sat).RESULTS eCO(2) and N-enr enhanced both g(wmax) and A(sat), but to differing degrees; g(wmax) was more strongly influenced by N-enr through increases in stomatal density while A(sat) was more strongly stimulated by eCO(2). There was a positive relationship between g(wmax) and A(sat) that was not modified by eCO(2) or N-enr, individually or in combination.CONCLUSIONS Changes in stomatal features co-occur with previously described responses of P. australis to eCO(2) and N-enr. Complementary responses of stomatal length and density to these global change factors may facilitate greater stomatal conductance and carbon gain, contributing to the invasiveness of the introduced lineage.

TI  - Inorganic carbon and oxygen dynamics in a marsh-dominated estuary
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a free-water mass balance-based study to address the rate of metabolism and net carbon exchange for the tidal wetland and estuarine portion of the coastal ocean and the uncertainties associated with this approach were assessed. We measured open water diurnal O-2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics seasonally in a salt marsh-estuary in Georgia, U.S.A. with a focus on the marsh-estuary linkage associated with tidal flooding. We observed that the overall estuarine system was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere and coastal ocean and a net sink for oceanic and atmospheric O-2. Rates of metabolism were extremely high, with respiration (43 mol m(-2) yr(-1)) greatly exceeding gross primary production (28 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), such that the overall system was net heterotrophic. Metabolism measured with DIC were higher than with O-2, which we attribute to high rates of anaerobic respiration and reduced sulfur storage in salt marsh sediments, and we assume substantial levels of anoxygenic photosynthesis. We found gas exchange from a flooded marsh is substantial, accounting for about 28% of total O-2 and CO2 air-water exchange. A significant percentage of the overall estuarine aquatic metabolism is attributable to metabolism of marsh organisms during inundation. Our study suggests not rely on oceanographic stoichiometry to convert from O-2 to C based measurements when constructing C balances for the coastal ocean. We also suggest eddy covariance measurements of salt marsh net ecosystem exchange underestimate net ecosystem production as they do not account for lateral DIC exchange associated with marsh tidal inundation.

TI  - Effects of Monospecific Banks of Salt Marsh Vegetation on Sediment Bacterial Communities
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to understand if two species of salt marsh plants, widely distributed in European estuaries (Spartina maritima and Halimione portulacoides) differently influence the distribution, activity, and metabolic physiology of sediment bacterial communities in monospecific banks, in comparison with uncolonized sediment (control). Microbiological descriptors of abundance and activity were assessed along vertical profiles of sediments. Rates of activity of the extracellular enzymes beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase were generally higher in the vegetation banks in relation to control sediments where they were also less variable with depth. This is interpreted as an indirect effect related to supply of plant-derived polymeric substrates for bacterial growth. Parameters related to sediment texture (grain size, percent of fines or water content) showed significant relations with cell abundance or maximum hydrolysis rates, pointing to an indirect effect of plant colonization exerted through the modification of sediment physical properties. The profiles of utilization of sole-carbon-source (Biolog Ecoplates) showed that only the communities from the upper sediment layer of the S. maritima and the H. portulacoides banks exhibit consistent differences in terms of physiological profiles. Bacterial communities in control sediments exhibited the lowest physiological variability between surface and sub-surface communities. The results indicate that microbial colonization and organic matter decomposition are enhanced under the influence of salt marsh plants and confirm that plant coverage is a major determinant of the processes of organic matter recycling in intertidal estuarine sediments.

TI  - SEASONAL-CHANGES IN EPIPELIC DIATOMS ALONG AN INTERTIDAL SHORE, BERROW FLATS, SOMERSET
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes in the assemblage structure of dominant epipelic diatoms were studied along a transect crossing a salt marsh, sandflat, and mudflat of an estuarine intertidal shore at Berrow Flats, Somerset, UK. Seasonal changes in cell numbers displayed different patterns in the salt marsh and sandflat/mudflat. At salt marsh sites highest numbers of individuals were recorded in summer followed by a smaller autumn growth, while in the sandflat lower numbers showed no seasonal pattern. Repeated annual patterns in the succession of taxa were not observed as environmental conditions changed at the study site with time. Measurements of salinity, pH, interstitial water content, air and soil temperature were taken together with the diatom samples. A canonical correspondence analysis was employed to relate seasonal changes in assemblage structure to measured environmental variables. Total percentage variation in the first four axes of the species/site-environmental biplots ranged between 54 and 66%. In winter, sites and species separated most significantly along gradients of salinity and levels of organic matter. In spring and autumn, interstitial water content became a more significant environmental variable. By summer steep gradients in pH, levels of organic matter, and hypersaline conditions separated sites and assemblages into more discrete groups when compared to the more even spread of points in the other seasons. The results indicate that different combinations of environmental variables influence diatom assemblage structure seasonally.

T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface son and sediment samples collected along a forest-brackfish marsh-salt marsh transect in a southeastern U.S. estuary were separated into three different fractions (sand, macro-organic matter, and humus) based on size and density Elemental, stable carbon isotope, and lignin analyses of these samples reveal important contrasts in the quantity, composition, and sources of organic matter between Forest and marsh sites. Elevated nitrogen contents in humus samples suggest nitrogen incorporation during humification is most extensive in forest soils relative to the marsh sites. The lignin compositions of the macro-organic and humus samples reflect the predominant type of vegetation at each site. Lignin phenol ratios indicate that woody and nonwoody litter from gymnosperm and angiosperms trees (pines and oaks) is the major source of vascular plant-derived organic matter in the forest site and that angiosperm grasses (Juncus and Spartina) are the major sources of lignin at the marsh sites. The phenol distributions also reveal that oxidative degradation of Lignin is most extensive in the forest and brackish marsh zones whereas little Lignin decay occurs in the salt marsh samples. In forest soils, most organic matter originates From highly altered forest vegetation while at the brackish marsh site organic matter is a mixture of degraded Juncus materials and microbial/algal remains. Organic matter in the salt marsh appears to be composed of a more complex mixture of sources, including degraded Spartina detritus as well as algal and microbial inputs. Microbial methane oxidation appears to be an important process and a source of C-15 depleted organic carbon in subsurface sediments at this site.

TI  - Data_Sheet_1_The Sedimentary Carbon-Sulfur-Iron Interplay - A Lesson From East Anglian Salt Marsh Sediments.docx
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - We explore the dynamics of the subsurface sulfur, iron and carbon cycles in salt marsh sediments from East Anglia, United Kingdom. We report measurements of pore fluid and sediment geochemistry, coupled with results from laboratory sediment incubation experiments, and develop a conceptual model to describe the influence of bioturbation on subsurface redox cycling. In the studied sediments the subsurface environment falls into two broadly defined geochemical patterns - iron-rich sediments or sulfide-rich sediments. Within each sediment type nearly identical pore fluid and solid phase geochemistry (in terms of concentrations of iron, sulfate, sulfide, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate) are observed in sediments that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Strictly iron-rich and strictly sulfide-rich sediments, despite their substantive geochemical differences, are observed within spatial distances of less than five meters. We suggest that this bistable system results from a series of feedback reactions that determine ultimately whether sediments will be sulfide-rich or iron-rich. We suggest that an oxidative cycle in the iron-rich sediment, driven by bioirrigation, allows rapid oxidation of organic matter, and that this irrigation impacts the sediment below the immediate physical depth of bioturbation. This oxidative cycle yields iron-rich sediments with low total organic carbon, dominated by microbial iron reduction and no methane production. In the absence of bioirrigation, sediments in the salt marsh become sulfide-rich with high methane concentrations. Our results suggest that the impact of bioirrigation not only drives recycling of sedimentary material but plays a key role in sedimentary interactions among iron, sulfur and carbon.

TI  - Measurement of acid polysaccharides (APS) associated with microphytobenthos in salt marsh sediments
T2  - AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microphytobenthos (MPB) are an important component of shallow-water habitats where there is sufficient light to support benthic photosynthesis. Production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is characteristic of the MPB, and acid polysaccharides (APS) are a major component of these EPS. A simple technique was developed to extract and measure APS concentrations in sediments. Water-extractable APS (wAPS) were extracted with ultra high purity water from lyophilized sediments. After centrifuging to remove the sediment, wAPS in the supernatant was precipitated with alcian blue, a cationic dye. The APS-alcian blue precipitate was removed by filtration. The remaining alcian blue in solution was determined spectrophotometrically and was inversely proportional to the concentration of wAPS in the sediment. Chlorophyll (chl) a, carbohydrate fractions, and wAPS were measured in sediments from 5 contrasting sites in a microtidal salt marsh in the subtropics. wAPS concentrations, expressed as gum xanthan equivalents, ranged from 152 to 6268 mg m(-2) in the upper 5 mm of sediment. The biomass (determined as chl a) of MPB at all sites was highest in the winter compared to the summer. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.675, p < 0.001, n = 107) between sediment wAPS and chl a concentrations. The ratio of wAPS to saline-extractable EPS (sEPS) was significantly higher in summer compared to winter, indicating a seasonal change in the composition of EPS. These data show that APS are a significant and variable component of the EPS pool in salt marsh sediments.

TI  - Hydrogeochemistry of near-surface groundwater on a developing barrier island (Spiekeroog, Germany): The role of inundation, season and vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate hydrogeochemical processes in sandy coastal aquifers, as they (i) host typical geographic features of the coast, including beaches, dunes, as well as salt marshes, (ii) are susceptible to the impacts of a global climate change, because of their low surface elevations, and (iii) are ubiquitous (>2,100) amongst the global coastlines. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near-surface groundwater on developing barrier islands, using the Ostplate on Spiekeroog Island, Germany, as an example. The impact of inundation, season and vegetation on the hydrogeochemical processes were of particular interest. Six groundwater monitoring wells were installed for this purpose, covering main geographic features of the Ostplate, i.e., supratidal beaches, dunes and salt marshes. Groundwater samples were collected bimonthly from April 2016 to March 2017. Measured parameters included major ions, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon/matter (DOC/DOM), delta C-13 signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as delta S-34 signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide. We found major ion compositions to be a function of the annual flooding frequency, although cation concentrations were further impacted by calcite dissolution and cation exchange. The redox chemistry varied at the different sites and through seasons. Aerobic respiration was the dominant pathway for carbon oxidation at the dune locations, whereas organic matter mineralization in the salt marsh was also mediated by anaerobic processes. Regarding electron donors, the presence of labile DOM was linked to salinity, and terrestrial DOM signatures as well as gross inputs of organic carbon agreed with vegetation patterns. A physico-chemical interpretation of the pore water compositions revealed a potential for the authigenic formation of carbonate and phosphate minerals in the investigated sediments, triggered by the redox processes.

TI  - Environmental determination of shoot height in populations of the cordgrass Spartina maritima
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina species tend to exhibit a range of phenotypes, often with short and tall growth forms. Such differences have been attributed variously to environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity and genetic differendation between populations. This work examines the basis of height variation in Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald at Odiel salt marshes, southwest Spain. Populations from sites with lower sediment redox potentials tended to have significantly taller shoots. Thirty-four natural populations with an 8-fold range of shoot height were transplanted to a common environment on an unvegetated, intertidal plain and shoot height was measured annually for 3 yr. There was a striking convergence in height across populations after transplantation and the change in height in each year of a population was linearly related to its initial height. Most populations grew taller after transplantation, suggesting environmental limitation in their natural habitats. Populations that were originally tall tended to become shorter. The change in shoot height was negatively related to the difference in surface sediment redox potential between their natural sites and the common transplant site. Hypoxic sediments may stimulate stem growth, resulting in improved photosynthetic gas exchange and internal aeration of roots and rhizomes. Although height variation in S. maritima appears mainly to be a result of phenotypic plasticity, a genetic component cannot be ruled out. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term studies, preferably longer than turnover time of shoot populations. The highly plastic growth form of S. maritima allows it to colonize a wide range of habitats in environmentally heterogeneous salt marshes.

TI  - Effects of salt marsh plants on mobility and bioavailability of REE in estuarine sediments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediments colonised by three halophyte species, Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald, Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen and Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott) and bulk sediment from a SW European salt marsh (Tagus estuary, Portugal) were subjected to sequential extractions and analysed to assess the rare earth elements (REE) geochemical fractionation and to evaluate the plants' role in the mobility and bioavailability of these elements. The results showed that REE were mainly bound to the residual (yttrium and heavy-REE) and carbonate (middle-REE and heavy-REE) fractions, followed by the reducible and oxidisable (light-REE and middle-REE) fractions, while the easily soluble fraction was negligible. This fractionation evidenced a sediment REE mobility mainly dependent not only on carbonates but also on Fe=Mn oxyhydroxides and on organic matter content. On the other hand, REE associated with the reducible and oxidisable fractions, and particularly the redoxsensitive Ce, may becomemore available, due to the redox condition seasonal changes that occur in saltmarshes' sediments promoted by the plants' activity. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the REE bioavailability depends not only on the sediments' characteristics and the plants' seasonal activity but also on the specificity of each element, as demonstrated by the different fractionation patterns observed in the various sedimentary fractions.

TI  - Pathways of organic matter through food webs of diverse habitats in the regulated Nakdong River estuary (Korea)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The benthic macroinvertebrates of the Nakdong River estuary were sampled at three different habitats: two salt marsh (Scirpus triqueter and Phragmites australis) beds and a bare intertidal flat. Fishes were sampled in the main channel. The trophic importance of marsh vascular plants, microphytobenthos, and riverine and channel particulate organic matter to macroinvertebrate and fish production was studied using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers. There was a dramatic change in coverage of macrophytes (salt marshes and seagrass) after the construction of an estuarine barrage in 1987 in the Nakdong River estuary, with the S. triqueter bed increasing, the P. australis bed decreasing, and Zostera marina habitats being nearly lost. Although the invertebrate delta C-13 were within a narrower range than those of the primary producers, the values varied considerably among consumers in these habitats. However, the isotope signatures of consumers showed similarities among different habitats. Cluster analysis based on their isotopic similarity suggested that the isotope variability among species was related more to functional feeding groups than to habitats or taxonomic groups. While delta C-13 values of suspension feeders were close to that of the channel POM (mainly phytoplankton), other benthic feeders and predators had delta C-13 similar to that of microphytobenthos. Isotopic mixing model estimates suggest that algal sources, including microphytobenthos and phytoplankton, play an important role in supporting the benthic food web. Despite the huge productivity of emergent salt marshes, the contribution of the marsh-derived organic matter to the estuarine food webs appears to be limited to some nutrition for some invertebrates just within marsh habitats, with little on the bare intertidal flats or in the channel fish communities. Isotope signatures of the channel fishes also confirm that algal sources are important in supporting fish nutrition. Our findings suggest that benthic and pelagic microalgae made a large contribution to consumer diets, while marsh plants may not have a large role in supporting food webs in this estuarine system.

CP  - 22nd International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry
CL  - Seville, SPAIN
AB  - Abundance, bulk chemical composition and sources of the organic matter in the surface horizon of the permanently water-covered part of an intermittently water-covered marsh were investigated. Lipids, insoluble non-hydrolysable macromolecular organic matter and black carbon fractions were isolated and examined via Rock-Eval pyrolysis, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) methods and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Integration of bulk Rock-Eval data, elemental and isotopic composition, together with spectroscopic features, suggested immature Type III organic matter derived mainly from C-3 vascular plants. The distribution of n-alkanes from the non-aromatic lipid fraction exhibited the importance of emergent macrophytes and terrestrial plants, as well as a moderate input of submerged/floating macrophytes to the source biomass. Mathematical deconvolution of a Rock-Eval pyrogram revealed highly heterogeneous organic matter composed of a mixture of thermally labile biopolymers (36%) at various stages of decomposition, as well as humic substances and highly refractory organic matter (64%) in the whole sample. Markedly lower heterogeneity and aliphaticity, together with a higher proportion of humic substances and highly refractory organic matter (ca. 84%) were observed in the macromolecular fraction. An abundant contribution of black carbon to the macromolecular fraction was indicated by mathematical deconvolution of the Rock-Eval pyrogram and was clearly shown by the isolation of this fraction and chemical oxidation. The black carbon fraction appeared to account for ca. half of the macromolecular fraction, the carbon in these two fractions representing 30% and 14% of the initial carbon, respectively. The electron microscopy observations directly evidenced the presence of black carbon, which was comprised of both amorphous poorly organized particles and highly ordered onion-shaped particles.

T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 40,500 ha of Spartina-dominated marshes died during a drought-induced disturbance in Louisiana. This caused concern because in the absence of recovery, dieback marshes call subside. increasing the present high rates of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. We assessed the recovery of one such dieback area after hydraulically dredged sediment-slurries were applied to the site to compensate for post-dieback soil consolidation. Five treatment-levels resulted from the sediment-slurry addition: 1) high elevation 2) medium elevation. 3) low elevation, 4) pop-up, and 5) vegetated. Plant recruitment within the five sediment treatment-levels were compared to two types of reference marshes: 1) ambient marshes. which neither died-back nor received sediment-enrichment, and 2) dieback marshes, which did not receive sediment addition. High and medium elevations had minimal recovery two years following the slurry addition. similar to that in reference dieback marshes. The low elevation, pop-up (highly organic sections of the original substrate that detached during slurry application and settled oil top of the sediment-slurry). and vegetated (dieback areas that recovered by the start of the Study) treatment-levels, all of which received sediment-slurry application, had rapid plant recovery. Plant recolonization,vas governed by optimal inundation, high organic matter content at high elevation, and. rhizome survivability following sediment burial. If applied appropriately, sediment-slurry amendments call restore Salt Marshes submerging due to subsidence or other events, like sea-level rise, that may result in excessive plant submergence,

TI  - Photochemical Release of Dissolved Organic Matter from Resuspended Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Incubation experiments were conducted to determine the influence of natural sunlight irradiation on the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from resuspended surface sediments. The photo-release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved nitrogen (DN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were quantified over time. During the 5-7-day incubations, 3.4-12.4 and 23-41 % of the sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) and 2.8-10.2 and 25-46 % of the solid phase nitrogen (TN) were released into DOC and DN pools from Florida and Massachusetts salt marsh sediments, respectively. The suspended, fractionated, clay-sized particles from Massachusetts released much higher DOC and DN than Florida bulk sediment. Up to 65 % of the DOC and 100 % of the DN photo-released from sediments were respired rapidly by bacteria, indicating that microorganisms play an important role in regulating the concentration of DOC and DN. The bioavailability of photo-released DOC and DN also depends largely on the biochemical nature of the DOM released from different sediments. Optical measurements confirmed that significant CDOM production was associated with the sunlight-induced DOC release. Photo-released CDOM appeared to be marine and humic-like as characterized by fluorescence and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. It is estimated that photo-production of DOC from resuspended sediments could account for 10-22 % of the DOC measured in the coastal waters adjacent to the marsh systems studied. These results indicate that production of DOM from resuspended sediments due to direct sunlight irradiation could be an important source of DOC, CDOM, and secondary production in salt marshes and marsh-dominated coastal waters.

TI  - A multi-scale approach for simulating tidal marsh evolution
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new approach to modeling marsh evolution. The Tidal Marsh Model (TMM) has been developed as a module within the SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) framework. Some unique features of the TMM are dynamic rates, cross-scale simulations, and incorporation of anthropogenic stressors, which allow it to overcome many limitations that current marsh models possess. To evaluate model performance, the TMM was applied in Carter Creek and Taskinas Creek within the York River system (Virginia, USA). We assessed model outputs against field observations focusing on two main aspects: marsh boundary evolution and distribution of marsh sediments. Marsh change is captured with an accuracy of 81% in Carter Creek and an accuracy of 78% in Taskinas Creek. Different statistical descriptors were used to evaluate the model's ability to reproduce the distribution of observed marsh sediment fractions. Results in both study areas show a satisfactory agreement between sediment model outputs and field observations. This innovative modeling approach will help close some critical knowledge gaps in the current understanding of the system dynamics and allow better implementation of management actions to preserve these ecosystems and their services.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-lethal effects of diesel fuel on N-2 fixing Spartina alterniflora stem microbial epiphytes from North Carolina salt marshes were examined to assess impacts of chronic petroleum pollution on the structure and function of this ecologically-important habitat in southeastern US estuaries. Changes in nitrogenase activity (NA), primary productivity, and chlorophyll (a) over bar (Chl (a) over bar) were assessed following short-term (3 hour) and longterm (4 day) exposures to a range of diesel fuel concentrations (0.87-17,400 ppm). In short-term experiments no effect was observed on Chl (a) over bar values and reductions in NA and primary productivity occurred only following exposure to high concentrations of diesel fuel (>5,000 ppm). Long-term incubations produced reductions in both NA and Chl (a) over bar at diesel fuel concentrations of 87 and 435 ppm. Primary productivity was reduced at additions greater than or equal to 8.7 ppm. Reduction in phototrophy and NA resulting from sublethal concentrations of petroleum pollution may affect biogeochemical cycling and trophodynamics in salt marshes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Bacterial. utilization of monomers is recognized as an important step in the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter. In this study we have compared the heterotrophic activity of bacterial. communities from different micro-habitats within a salt marsh environment (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) in order to establish spatial patterns of bacterial. abundance, monomer turnover rates (Tr) and bacterial. growth efficiency (BGE).Differences in bacterial. abundance and activity could be found between distinct plant rhizospheres. BGE tended to be lower at Halimione portulacoides banks, when compared to Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis banks which, on the contrary, showed the highest bacterial. densities.Experiments of amendment of natural samples with organic and inorganic supplements indicated that salt marsh bacteria are not strongly regulated by salinity but the increased availability of labile organic matter causes a significant metabolic shift towards mineralization.

TI  - Relative importance of benthic microalgae, phytoplankton and the detritus of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and the common reed Phragmites australis to brackish-marsh food webs
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a study to determine the trophic pathways leading to juvenile fish in 2 mesohaline tidal marshes bordering Delaware Bay. The relative roles of the major primary producers in supplying energy, ultimately, to the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus were assessed by measuring the stable isotopic compositions of juveniles (21 to 56 mm total length, TL; most of which were young-of-the-year) and those of macrophyte vegetation, phytoplankton, and benthic microalgae at each site. We collected samples of primary producers and F. heteroclitus, the dominant fish species in this and other marshes along the east coast of the USA, in June and August 1997, at 2 study sites (upstream and downstream) within Mad Horse Creek (a Spartina alterniflora-dominated site) and Alloway Creek (a Phragmites australis-dominated site), for a total of 4 study sites. Our results indicate that F. heteroclitus production is based on a mixture of primary producers, but the mixture depends on the relative abundance of macrophytes. In S. alterniflora-dominated marshes, C and S isotope ratios indicate that F. heteroclitus production is supported by S, alterniflora production (ca 39%, presumably via detritus), while in P. australis-dominated marshes, secondary production is based upon P. australis (73%). To our knowledge, this finding provides the first evidence that P. australis may contribute to aquatic food webs in tidal marshes. Benthic microalgae also contribute to the food chain that leads to F. heteroclitus in both marsh types, while phytoplankton may be of lesser importance. Benthic microalgal biomass was lower in the P, australis-dominated system, consistent with a greater effect of shading in P, australis- versus S. alterniflora-based creek systems. Based on the difference in nitrogen isotope values between F. heteroclitus and the primary producers, the trophic level of F. heteroclitus appears to be similar in the 2 marsh types, despite the differing vegetation types. In summary, the relative roles of the primary producers in supplying energy to F. heteroclitus varies locally and, in particular, with respect to the type of marsh macrophyte vegetation.

TI  - Controls on salt marsh accretion: A test in salt marshes of Eastern Canada
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used Cs-137-dating to determine vertical accretion rates of 15 salt marshes on the Bay of Fundy, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Accretion rates are compared to a number of factors assumed to influence vertical marsh accretion: rates of relative sea-level rise, climatic parameters (average daily temperatures and degree days) and latitude (related to insolation and day length), sediment characteristics (organic matter inventory, bulk, mineral, and organic matter density), distance of the core site from the nearest source of tidal waters, and the tidal range. Unique to our study is a consideration of climatic parameters and latitude, which should influence organic matter production, and thus vertical accretion rates. Significant predictors of accretion rates (in order of importance) were found to be organic matter inventory, distance from a creek, and range of mean tides. Contrary to conclusions from previous studies, we found that accretion rates decreased with increasing tidal range, probably because we considered a wider span of tidal ranges, from micro- to macrotidal. Although four marshes with low organic matter inventories also show a deficit in accretion with respect to relative sea-level rise, organic matter is not limiting in two-thirds of the marshes studied, despite shorter growing seasons.

TI  - Localized Scenarios and Latitudinal Patterns of Vertical and Lateral Resilience of Tidal Marshes to Sea-Level Rise in the Contiguous United States
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands have two dimensions of vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR), a vertical one, in cases where SLR outpaces their capacity to vertically accrete, and a lateral one, in cases where they are restricted from migrating inland by topography and land use. We conducted a meta-analysis of accretion rates, standardized our analysis by using only Cs-137 based estimates, and used model intercomparison to generate a vertical resilience index, a function of local SLR, tidal range, and tidal elevation category for the tidal wetlands of the contiguous US. We paired the vertical resilience index with a lateral resilience index made up of elevation, water level, and land cover maps, then projected them both into the future using localized SLR scenarios. At the regional scale, the vertical resilience index predicts changes from marsh aggradation to submergence for the coastal US Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and portions of the Northeast by 2100. At the sub-regional scale, there is a geographic tradeoff between vertical and lateral resilience with more northerly wetlands vulnerable to the lack of suitable proportional area to migrate into, and more southerly wetlands vulnerable to accretion deficit. We estimate between 43% and 48% of the existing contiguous US wetland area, almost entirely located in watersheds along the Gulf of Mexico and Mid-Atlantic coasts, is subject to both vertical and lateral limitations. These vertical and lateral resilience indices could help direct future research, planning, and mitigation efforts at a national scale, as well as supplement more processed informed approaches by local planners and practitioners.

TI  - Brinson Review: Perspectives on the Influence of Nutrients on the Sustainability of Coastal Wetlands
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Review
AB  - Among the solutions being proposed for reversing wetland loss in the Mississippi River Delta are the creation of diversions to reintroduce suspended sediment carried in the river. In areas of rapid relative sea-level rise, as in the Mississippi Delta, it is generally accepted that a supply of sediment in flood water and mineral sedimentation are critical to sustaining wetlands. But plans to create diversions have raised questions about the collateral effects of nutrients carried in the Mississippi River, effects that may contravene the benefits of sediment. This review finds the balance of empirical and theoretical evidence supports that nutrients benefit above- and belowground plant production and that fresh water and sediment diversions can be effective and beneficial for restoring wetlands in the Delta, especially if designed to maximize sediment inputs. The input of sediment, nutrients, and fresh water will change the community composition of some wetlands and their biogeochemical processes. Most of the nitrogen input should be assimilated or denitrified. Labile organic matter is likely to degrade more quickly, but labile organic matter does not add 'new' soil volume and its speed of decay is of little consequence. Additional research is needed before we fully understand the consequences of nutrients on the preservation of organic matter in sediment, but building on what is known of the activities of lignin-degrading fungi and their enzymes, it is likely that refractory organic matter should increase and contribute positively to sediment accretion. This is supported by long-term studies of sediment accretion in a New England salt marsh with peat sediment, and in a mineral-dominated southeastern salt marsh, that show elevations in fertilized plots gained as much or more than in reference plots.

TI  - Data from: Geochemical analyses reveal the importance of environmental history for blue carbon sequestration
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate      and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia.      Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of      intertidal-supratidal wetlands is known to respond to changes imposed by      geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level and anthropogenic influences. In      this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical      conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE      Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors      to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results      from the four cores - two collected from marine influenced saltmarshes      (WAP-M and POR-M) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (WAP-F and      POR-F) - highlight different environmental histories and preservation      conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove      phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F      cores. 13C NMR analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be      remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent      with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain      mangrove root C, however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of      C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment      processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance      of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to      upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and salt marshes provide a range of important benefits to people, broadly defined as ecosystem services. These include provisioning services such as fuelwood and food, regulating services such as carbon sequestration and wave attenuation, and various tangible and intangible cultural services. However, strong negative perceptions of coastal wetlands also exist, often driven by the perceived or actual ecosystem disservices that they also produce. These can include odour, a sense of danger, and their real or perceived role in vector and disease transmission (e.g. malaria). This review provides an introduction to the ecosystem services and disservices concepts and highlights the broad range of services and chdisservices provided by mangrove forests and salt marshes. Importantly, we discuss the key implications of ecosystem services and disservices for the management of these coastal ecosystems. Ultimately, a clear binary does not exist between ecosystem services and disservices; an ecosystem service to one stakeholder can be viewed as a disservice to another, or a service can change seasonally into a disservice, and vice versa. It is not enough to only consider the beneficial ecosystem services that coastal wetlands provide: instead, we need to provide a balanced view of coastal wetlands that incorporates the complexities that exist in how humans relate to and interact with them.

TI  - Spatial Planning Principles for Marine Ecosystem Restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

M3  - Meeting paper
AB  - Coastal marshes on Delmarva Peninsula, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA, provide valuable ecosystem services including flood prevention, erosion control, filtration, and carbon sequestration, and support commercial and recreational fishing, trapping, hunting, and ecotourism that generate billions of dollars for the region. Nutria (Myocastor coypus) were introduced to Dorchester County on the eastern side of Delmarva peninsula in 1943. They spread rapidly and reached peak densities in the late 1990s when vegetation studies linked nutria herbivory to massive wetland loss throughout Maryland's lower eastern shore. A coalition of state, federal and non-governmental organisations obtained congressional funding to eradicate nutria from the Delmarva Peninsula and, beginning in 2002, implemented a systematic eradication plan. The eradication team used integrated methods to complete the initial reduction of nutria populations on 60,000 ha of marsh in five counties across Maryland's lower eastern shore. Population reductions to near-zero were accomplished using trapping and shooting applied systematically using GPS and GIS to apply removal efforts at the landscape level. Residual animals were removed using dogs and targeted trapping. New techniques for detecting nutria at low densities are currently being evaluated including dogs, lures and attractants, call surveys, judas nutria, and decoy cages. Recovery of nutria-damaged marsh has been significant and has halted further conversion of marsh to open water. The programme now aims to create a nutria-free coastal marsh ecosystem across the Delmarva Peninsula by 2014.

TI  - Variability of Polychaete Secondary Production in Intertidal Creek Networks along a Stream-Order Gradient
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic tidal creek networks are important habitats for sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in salt marsh wetlands. To evaluate the importance of creek heterogeneity in supporting benthic secondary production, we assess the spatial distribution and secondary production of a representative polychaete species (Dentinephtys glabra) in creek networks along a stream-order gradient in a Yangtze River estuarine marsh. Density, biomass, and secondary production of polychaetes were found to be highest in intermediate order creeks. In high order (3rd and 4th) creeks, the density and biomass of D. glabra were higher in creek edge sites than in creek bottom sites, whereas the reverse was true for low order (1st and 2nd) creeks. Secondary production was highest in 2nd order creeks (559.7 mg AFDM m(-2) year(-1)) and was ca. 2 folds higher than in 1st and 4th order creeks. Top fitting AIC models indicated that the secondary production of D. glabra was mainly associated with geomorphological characters including cross-sectional area and bank slope. This suggests that hydrodynamic forces are essential factors influencing secondary production of macrobenthos in salt marshes. This study emphasizes the importance of microhabitat variability when evaluating secondary production and ecosystem functions.

TI  - Microalgal productivity, community composition, and pelagic food web dynamics in a subtropical, turbid salt marsh isolated from freshwater inflow
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon entering the food web originating from microalgal productivity may be as important to salt marsh consumers as carbon originating from vascular plant production. The objective of this study was to further our understanding of the role played by microalgae in salt marshes. We focused on microalgal productivity, community dynamics, and pelagic food web linkages. Across three consecutive springs (2001-2003), we sampled the upper Nueces Delta in southeast Texas, United States; a shallow, turbid system of ponds and elevated vegetated areas stressed by low freshwater inflow and salinities ranging from brackish (11) to hypersaline (300). Despite high turbidity and low external nutrient loadings, microalgal productivity was on the order of that reported for vascular plants. Primary productivity in surface waters ranged from 0 to 2.02 g C m(-2) d(-1) and was usually higher than primary productivity associated with the benthos, which ranged from 0 to 1.14 g C m(-2) d(-1). This was likely due to high amounts of wind-driven resuspended sediment limiting production at greater depths. Most of the water column microalgal biovolume seemed to originate from the benthos and was comprised mostly of pennate diatoms. But true phytoplankton taxa were also observed, which included cryptomonads, chlorophyhtes, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria. Succession from r-selected to K-selected taxa. with the progression of spring, a common phenomena in aquatic systems, was not observed. Codominance by both potentially edible and less edible taxa was found. This was likely due to decreased grazing pressure on r-selected taxa as salinity conditions became unfavorable for grazers. In addition to a decoupled food web, reduced primary and net productivity, community respiration, and microalgal and zooplankton population densities were all observed at extreme salinities. Our findings suggest that a more accurate paradigm of salt marsh functioning within the landscape must account for microalgal productivity as well as production by vascular plants. Because the value of microalgal productivity to higher trophic levels is taxa specific, the factors that govern microalgal community structure and dynamics must also be accounted for. In the case for the Nueces Delta, these factors included wind mixing and increasing salinities.

AB  - In April 2015, using enclosed static opaque chamber-GC techniques, the short-term effects of nitrogen and sulfate addition on the CH4 and CO2 emissions were measured in the Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the high tidal flat of the Minjiang River estuary, and the key factors controlling the variation of CH4 and CO2 were examined. The influences of nitrogen and sulfate addition on the CH4 and CO2 emissions were different in different time scales. CH4 emission increased significantly under the NH4 Cl (NH) and NH4NO3+ K2SO4 (NS) additions (P < 0.01), CO2 emission increased significantly with NS addition (P < 0.05), but CH, and CO2 emissions demonstrated an obvious fluctuation pattern with KNO, (NO) and K2SO4 (S) additions. Compared with the control (CK), average CH4 emissions increased by 286.36% and 122.73%, respectively, in the NH and NS addition treatments, average CO2 emissions increased by 39.92% and 34.24%, respectively, with the NH and NS additions treatments. The nitrogen and sulfate addition changed the temporal variation of CH, and CO2 emissions from the C. malaccensis wetlands in growing season. Significant correlations were found among CO2, CH4 emissions, and soil temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and NH4+-N (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the treatments with NH and NS additions; and soil temperature, EC, DOC and NO3--N (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the treatments with NO and NS additions. Temperature, EC and nitrogen availability were the dominant factors controlling the temporal variations of CH4 and CO2 emissions in estuarine tidal marsh ecosystem.

TI  - Ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa enhance nitrogen-removal services but not plant growth in restored eutrophic salt marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are decreasing worldwide. Restoration projects address marsh loss, yet it remains unclear how well restored marshes grow, expand, and function in eutrophic waters. Here, we explored how a facultative mutualism between Atlantic ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and cordgrass Spartina alterniflora may enhance marsh growth and nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic setting. We created experimental plots in Jamaica Bay, NY, that contained live mussels, mussel shells, or no mussels (control). After 9 wk, we measured sediment and plant characteristics. We also collected sediment cores for use in continuous flow-through incubations with ambient site water and water enriched with stable isotope-labeled nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15). Denitrification in marsh plots with live mussels was significantly higher than the other treatments. Live mussels likely enhanced denitrification as biodeposits increased sediment organic carbon and anaerobic conditions. Mussel treatments did not impact cordgrass growth, possibly due to the eutrophic conditions of our study system or the duration of our trials. Ribbed mussels may be a valuable addition for salt marsh restoration projects in eutrophic estuaries since they increase the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal. Future work should focus on long-term effects of ribbed mussels on nitrogen removal and cordgrass biomass in restored marshes to determine how the mutualism impacts restoration success as sites age.

TI  - Incorporation of terrestrial wetland material into aquatic food webs in a tropical estuarine wetland
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of a range of organisms collected from two intermittently connected floodplain pools in the Ross River estuary were analysed to assess the extent to which carbon fixed by terrestrial wetland producers is incorporated into adjacent aquatic food webs. The two pools differed in surrounding vegetation with one surrounded by mangroves and the other by the salt couch Sporobolus virginicus. At both pools, animals showed differences in delta C-13, indicating differences in Sources of carbon. Since delta C-13 Values of C-3 mangroves (-29.7 to -26.3 parts per thousand) were very different from those of the C-4 salt couch (-16.3 to -15.4 parts per thousand,), it was possible to determine the importance of terrestrial wetland producers by comparing isotope values of consumers between sites, in a species by species approach. Most animal species collected showed lower 813 C at the mangrove pool than at the Sporobolus pool, which indicates a greater incorporation of mangrove carbon at the mangrove pool. However, the animals' isotopic shifts were also similar to that shown by epiphytes, and hence the differences in animal delta C-13 could also be a result of a dependence on these producers. The IsoSource model was useful to clarify this question, indicating that mangrove and salt marsh material was a crucial contributor to the diet of several fish and invertebrate species at both sites, indicating that carbon of terrestrial origin is incorporated in the estuarine food web.

TI  - Limited seed retention during winter inhibits vegetation establishment in spring, affecting lateral marsh expansion capacity
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal systems worldwide deliver vital ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and coastal protection. Effectivity of these ecosystem services increases when vegetation is present. Understanding the mechanisms behind vegetation establishment in bio-geomorphic systems is necessary to understand their ability to recover after erosive events and potential adaptations to climate change. In this study, we examined how seed availability affects vegetation establishment in the salt marsh-intertidal flat transition zone: the area with capacity for lateral marsh expansion. This requires vegetation establishment; therefore, seed availability is essential. In a 6-month field experiment, we simulated a before and after winter seed dispersal at two locations, the salt-marsh vegetation edge and the intertidal flat, and studied seed retention, the seed bank, and the seed viability of three pioneer marsh species: Salicornia procumbens, Aster tripolium, and Spartina anglica. During winter storm conditions, all supplied seeds eroded away with the sediment surface layer. After winter, supplied seeds from all three species were retained, mostly at the surface while 9% was bioturbated downwards. In the natural seed bank, A. tripolium and S. anglica were practically absent while S. procumbens occurred more frequently. The viability of S. procumbens seeds was highest at the surface, between 80% and 90%. The viability quickly decreased with depth, although viable S. procumbens seeds occurred up to 15 cm depth. Only when seeds were supplied after winter, many S. procumbens and some S. anglica individuals did establish successfully in the transition zone. Viable seed availability formed a vegetation establishment threshold, even with a local seed source. Our results suggest that, although boundary conditions such as elevation, inundation, and weather conditions were appropriate for vegetation establishment in spring, the soil surface in winter can be so dynamic that it limits lateral marsh expansion. These insights can be used for designing effective nature-based coastal protection.

TI  - Successional patterns of key genes and processes involved in the microbial nitrogen cycle in a salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we investigated the patterns of microbial nitrogen cycling communities along a chronosequence of soil development in a salt marsh. The focus was on the abundance and structure of genes involved in N fixation (nifH), bacterial and archaeal ammonium oxidation (amoA; AOB and AOA), and the abundances of genes involved in denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ). Potential nitrification and denitrification activities were also measured, and increases in nitrification were found in soils towards the end of succession, whereas denitrification became maximal in soils at the intermediate stages. The nifH, nirK and nirS gene markers revealed increases in the sizes of the respective functional groups towards the intermediate stage (35 years), remaining either constant (for nifH) or slightly declining towards the latest stage of succession (for nirK and nirS). Moreover, whereas the AOB abundance peaked in soils at the intermediate stage, that of AOA increased linearly along the chronosequence. The abundance of nosZ was roughly constant, with no significant regression. The drivers of changes in abundance and structure were identified using path analysis; whereas the ammonia oxidizers (AOA and AOB) showed patterns that followed mainly N availability, those of the nitrogen fixers followed plant diversity and soil structure. The patterns of denitrifiers were group-dependent, following the patterns of plant diversity (nirK and nirS) and belowground shifts (nosZ). The variation observed for the microbial groups associated with the same function highlights their differential contribution at different stages of soil development, revealing an interplay of changes in terms of niche complementarity and adaptation to the local environment.

TI  - Role of ecological interactions in saltmarsh geomorphic processes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated sea-level rise poses a significant threat to coastal habitats, such as salt marshes, which provide critical ecosystem services. Persistence of salt marshes with rising sea levels relies, in part, on vertical accretion. Ecogeomorphic models emphasize the role of plant production in vertical accretion via sediment trapping and belowground organic matter contribution. Thus, changes in plant production can influence saltmarsh persistence with sea-level rise. However, models of marsh accretion do not consider animal-mediated changes in plant production. We tested how 2 marsh crabs, Minuca pugnax and Sesarma reticulatum, which have contrasting effects (facilitation vs. herbivory) on Spartina alterniflora production, may indirectly influence sediment deposition and belowground production, through observational surveys and field manipulation. Minuca facilitated Spartina biomass in some marshes, but not sediment deposition, and had no effect on belowground organic matter contribution, suggesting that in isolation, Minuca has little indirect impact on saltmarsh geomorphic processes. Sesarma reduced Spartina biomass; however, sediment deposition increased, contrary to ecogeomorphic models, likely due to sediment resuspension by Minuca. When Minuca and Sesarma co-occur, the effect on Spartina production and sediment deposition depended on the amount of grazing. When Sesarma grazing is low, Minuca facilitates Spartina growth and mitigates the effect of grazing. However, when Sesarma grazing is high and vegetation is removed, Minuca can resuspend sediment through bioturbation, suggesting the net effect of these species may depend on their relative abundance. This study demonstrates that the effects of plant-animal interactions on marsh resilience against sealevel rise are context dependent.

T2  - Pan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio and temporal variation in benthic macroinfaunal structure in saltmarshes from the Para coast was described at four sites, sampled in April and November of 2008, representing peak conditions in the wet and dry periods, respectively. Differences in abundance and taxa were found among sites and between dates. High macroinfaunal abundance and number of taxa were associated with tall, dense vegetation and sand, and with high salinity, higher temperatures and low sediment organic matter content in November. Typically marine organisms, such as Halmyrapseudes spaansi, Capitella cf. capitata and ostracods of the Family Cypridae were identified as dominant taxa at this time and associated with relatively lower organic matter content in the sediment.

TI  - Climate changes in mangrove forests and salt marshes
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - This synthesis is framed within the scope of the Brazilian Benthic Coastal Habitat Monitoring Network (ReBentos WG 4: Mangroves and Salt Marshes), focusing on papers that examine biodiversity-climate interactions as well as human-induced factors including those that decrease systemic resilience. The goal is to assess difficulties related to the detection of climate and early warning signals from monitoring data. We also explored ways to circumvent some of the obstacles identified. Exposure and sensitivity of mangrove and salt marsh species and ecosystems make them extremely vulnerable to environmental impacts and potential indicators of sea level and climate-driven environmental change. However, the interpretation of shifts in mangroves and salt marsh species and systemic attributes must be scrutinized considering local and setting-level energy signature changes; including disturbance regime and local stressors, since these vary widely on a regional scale. The potential for adaptation and survival in response to climate change depends, in addition to the inherent properties of species, on contextual processes at the local, landscape, and regional levels that support resilience. Regardless of stressor type, because of the convergence of social and ecological processes, coastal zones should be targeted for anticipatory action to reduce risks and to integrate these ecosystems into adaptation strategies. Management must be grounded on proactive mitigation and collaborative action based on long-term ecosystem-based studies and well-designed monitoring programs that can 1) provide real-time early warning and 2) close the gap between simple correlations that provide weak inferences and process-based approaches that can yield increasingly reliable attribution and improved levels of anticipation.

TI  - Intertidal salt marshes as an important source of inorganic carbon to the coastal ocean
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic tidal export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the coastal ocean from highly productive intertidal marshes and its effects on seawater carbonate chemistry are thoroughly evaluated. The study uses a comprehensive approach by combining tidal water sampling of CO2 parameters across seasons, continuous in situ measurements of biogeochemically-relevant parameters and water fluxes, with high-resolution modeling in an intertidal salt marsh of the U.S. northeast region. Salt marshes can acidify and alkalize tidal water by injecting CO2 (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). DIC and TA generation may also be decoupled due to differential effects of marsh aerobic and anaerobic respiration on DIC and TA. As marsh DIC is added to tidal water, the buffering capacity first decreases to a minimum and then increases quickly. Large additions of marsh DIC can result in higher buffering capacity in ebbing tide than incoming tide. Alkalization of tidal water, which mostly occurs in the summer due to anaerobic respiration, can further modify buffering capacity. Marsh exports of DIC and alkalinity may have complex implications for the future, more acidified ocean. Marsh DIC export exhibits high variability over tidal and seasonal cycles, which is modulated by both marsh DIC generation and by water fluxes. The marsh DIC export of 414 g C m(-2) yr(-1), based on high-resolution measurements and modeling, is more than twice the previous estimates. It is a major term in the marsh carbon budget and translates to one of the largest carbon fluxes along the U.S. East Coast.

TI  - Optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in surface and pore waters adjacent to an oil well in a southern California salt marsh
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were measured in surface and pore waters as a function of depth and distance from an oil well in a southern California salt marsh. Higher fluorescence and absorbances in pore vs. surface waters suggest soil pore water is a reservoir of CDOM in the marsh. Protein-like fluorophores in pore waters at distinct depths corresponded to variations in sulfate depletion and Fe(II) concentrations from anaerobic microbial activity. These variations were supported by fluorescence indexes and are consistent with differences in optical molecular weight and aromaticity indicators. Fluorescence indices were consistent with autochthonous material of aquatic origin in surface waters, with more terrestrial, humified allochthonous material in deeper pore waters. CDOM optical properties were consistent with significantly enhanced microbial activity in regions closest to the oil well, along with a three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectrum peak attributable to oil, suggesting anaerobic microbial degradation of oil.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen composition and stable isotope as potential indicators of source and fate of organic matter in the salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions were measured for surface sediments, three sediment vibrocores, plants, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary. The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Marsh sediments were collected from Spartina alterniflora habitat 20-25 cm from three sites along a nitrogen gradient and homogenized before loading into reactors. The experiment was run for ~100 days under anaerobic conditions, during which we measured changes in nitrate, ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, rates of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and changes in percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen.

TI  - Indirect Human Impacts Reverse Centuries of Carbon Sequestration and Salt Marsh Accretion
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

TI  - Changes in soil microbial community composition during Phragmites australis straw decomposition in salt marshes with freshwater pumping
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic changes of soil microorganisms after Phragmites oust rails straw addition in the incubation tubes were analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid stable isotope probing (PLEA-SIP). After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Composition of Venice Lagoon sediments: distribution, sources, settings and recent evolution
T2  - GeoActa
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine short cores taken from the less contaminated areas of the Venice Lagoon were analyzed in order to describe the main physical and chemical features of sediments (grain size, mineralogy, major and trace elements, organic carbon and total nitrogen) and to assess the mechanisms which control them. The sediment composition reflects the relative importance of the sources because it is a mixture of silicates and carbonates supplied by southern rivers and northern rivers, respectively. In cores from the central and southern lagoon, significant changes of the sediment features occur with time, reflecting the evolution of the lagoon hydrodynamic conditions and the increasing influence of the Adriatic Sea. Sediment features also distinguish depositional environments: in particular salt marsh sediments are calcium depleted, compared to the neighboring lagoon sediments, due to the preferential dissolution of calcite in subaerial environments. On the other hand, they are enriched in organic carbon and total nitrogen, while C/N ratio and bromine are high, for the presence of halophytic vegetation (in particular Salicornia sp.). The anthropogenic signature on the sediment geochemistry mainly regards Zn, Pb and Cu, but the low maximum concentration factors (1.2-2.2) confirm that these samples represent little contaminated areas. In this context only the sediments of the southern salt marsh core slightly exceed such values (up to 3 and 2.8 for Zn and Pb, respectively).

TI  - PHOTOCHEMICAL PRODUCTION OF DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON FROM TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC-MATTER - SIGNIFICANCE TO THE OCEANIC ORGANIC-CARBON CYCLE
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water collected from riverine, near coastal, and salt marsh sources in the Southeastern United States was evaluated for its ability to produce both carbon monoxide (CO) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by photochemical oxidation of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Irradiation of whole water samples using simulated sunlight produced CO at rates similar to those measured previously.  Production rates for DIC were more than an order of magnitude higher than those observed for CO.  Based on observed DIC formation rates, photo-oxidation of DOC by sunlight should be considered a dominant removal mechanism of organic carbon from the ocean.

TI  - The effect of tidal forcing on biogeochemical processes in intertidal salt marsh sediments
T2  - GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early diagenetic processes involved in natural organic matter ( NOM) oxidation in marine sediments have been for the most part characterized after collecting sediment cores and extracting porewaters. These techniques have proven useful for deep-sea sediments where biogeochemical processes are limited to aerobic respiration, denitrification, and manganese reduction and span over several centimeters. In coastal marine sediments, however, the concentration of NOM is so high that the spatial resolution needed to characterize these processes cannot be achieved with conventional sampling techniques. In addition, coastal sediments are influenced by tidal forcing that likely affects the processes involved in carbon oxidation.Results: In this study, we used in situ voltammetry to determine the role of tidal forcing on early diagenetic processes in intertidal salt marsh sediments. We compare ex situ measurements collected seasonally, in situ profiling measurements, and in situ time series collected at several depths in the sediment during tidal cycles at two distinct stations, a small perennial creek and a mud flat. Our results indicate that the tides coupled to the salt marsh topography drastically influence the distribution of redox geochemical species and may be responsible for local differences noted year-round in the same sediments. Monitoring wells deployed to observe the effects of the tides on the vertical component of porewater transport reveal that creek sediments, because of their confinements, are exposed to much higher hydrostatic pressure gradients than mud flats.Conclusion: Our study indicates that iron reduction can be sustained in intertidal creek sediments by a combination of physical forcing and chemical oxidation, while intertidal mud flat sediments are mainly subject to sulfate reduction. These processes likely allow microbial iron reduction to be an important terminal electron accepting process in intertidal coastal sediments.

AB  - Metal (Cu, Cr, Cd, Zn, Mn, Co, Pb and Ni) concentrations and distribution in superficial sediments of 2 wetland plant communities: mangrove and salt marsh, in Baia de Sepetiba, Rio de Janeiro were compared. Both communities are subjected to the same sources of metallic pollution. Mangrove sediments presented significantly higher concentrations of all metals. The twice higher content of organic matter found in the latter sediments, their lower oxygenation and the relative position of the 2 communities in relation to wave and tide actions, explain the higher metal concentration found in the mangrove sediments.

TI  - Decomposition of belowground marshes (Tagus litter and metal dynamics in salt Estuary, Portugal)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentrations of C, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ph and Cd were determined monthly in decomposing roots of Halmione portulacoides, using litterbag experiments, in two salt marshes of the Tagus estuary with different levels of contamination. Although carbon concentrations varied within a narrow interval during the experiment, litter decomposed rapidly in the first month (weight loss between 0.051 and 0.065 g d(-1)). The time variation of metals was examined in terms of Me/C ratios and metal stocks. Ratios of Fe/C and Mn/C and their metal stocks increased in spring, presumably due to the precipitation of oxides in the surface of decomposing roots. Subsequent decrease of Fe/C and Mn/C ratios suggests the use of Fe and Mn oxides, as electron acceptors, in the organic matter oxidation. Zinc, Cu, Pb and Cd ratios to C were, in general, higher than at initial conditions implying that metal that leached out was slower than carbon. However, metal stocks decreased during the experiment indicating that incorporation or sorption of metals in Fe and Mn oxides did not counterbalance the amount of Zn, Ph and Cd released from decomposing litter. An exception was observed for Cu, since stock in the less contaminated marsh (Pancas) increased during the decomposition, indicating that litter was efficient on Cu binding under more oxidising conditions. These results emphasize the importance of litter decomposition and sediment characteristics on metal cycling in salt marshes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Coastal land use and shoreline evolution along the Nador lagoon Coast in Morocco
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The coastal zone, a highly dynamic and complex environment, has important ecological and jurisdictional implications for governments and coastal managers. Based on the CORINE Land Cover classification system, this paper examined the effects of land use and land cover change (LULC) on the coastlines' dynamics along the similar to 24 km barrier island of Nador lagoon on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco during a period of 62 years (1954-2016). The study utilized high-resolution orthoimages in the geographic information system (GIS) environment to characterize coastline evolution and LULC changes. The evolution of the coastline was assessed using a GIS tool, in particular the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The net rates of coastline change were calculated by using statistical methods: the End Point Rate (EPR) and the Linear Regression Rate (LRR). Results concerning the LULC changes showed that agricultural area and beach/dune classes decreased over the entire study period (62 years) by 11.14% and 28.45%, respectively. Urban fabric, shrub, forest, and saltmarsh/peat bog classes increased during the 62 years of evaluation by 2.69%, 19.92%, 16.77%, and 0.19%, respectively. Results regarding coastal analysis indicated that the accretion and erosion processes along the barrier island of the Nador lagoon (similar to 24km) were observed at 45% (10.6 km) and 55% (12.8 km) of the coastline, respectively. The beaches of Oulad Zehra and Oulad Aissa were characterized by erosion (-0.58 m/yr to -0.57 m/yr respectively), while accretion was observed on the beaches of Boukana and Kariat Arkmane at rates of +2.15 m/yr and +0.82 m/yr, respectively. This study highlighted that natural and anthropogenic processes have a strong influence on the erosion/accretion trends identified along the barrier island of Nador lagoon. The changes in LULC have affected the barrier island of the lagoon in two different forms: (1) a significant spatial conversion due to dune reforestation and (2) a fundamental spatial modification that affects the sea-lagoon connection (inlet) and the construction of new hard engineering structures.

TI  - Microbial utilization of estuarine dissolved organic carbon: A stable isotope tracer approach tested by mass balance
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural stable isotope values of different plants have been used to trace the fate of organic carbon that enters estuarine ecosystems, Experiments were designed to determine the magnitude of delta C-13 changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from tidal marsh vegetation that occurred during bacterial decomposition, Bacteria were grown on DOC leached from estuarine Spartina alterniflora and Typhus angustifolia plants, In four experiments, 25 to 80% of the initial carbon (2.6 to 9.1 mM organic C) was converted to bacterial biomass and CO2. Mass balance calculations showed good recovery of total C and C-13 at the end of these experiments (100% +/- 14% total C; +/- 1 parts per thousand delta C-13). The delta C-13 values of DOC, bacterial biomass, and respired CO2 changed only slightly in the four experiments by average values of -0.6, +1.4, and +0.5 parts per thousand, respectively. These changes are small relative to the range of delta C-13 values represented by different organic carbon sources to estuaries. Thus, microbial delta C-13 values determined in the field helped to identify the source of the carbon assimilated by bacteria.

TI  - Influence of surfactants on the Cu phytoremediation potential of a salt marsh plant
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the possible effect that surfactants commonly found in the aquatic environment may have on the remediation potential of the salt marsh plant Halimione portulacoides, a non-ionic (Triton X-100) and an anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) surfactants were used. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory, either in hydroponics (sediment elutriate) or in sediment soaked in elutriate, using sediment and water from an estuarine salt marsh (Cavado River, NW Portugal). Groups of H. portulacoides (grown in a greenhouse) were exposed for 6 d to media with 0.16 mM added Cu(II) in the absence and in the presence of each one of the two selected surfactants, at concentrations lower than the respective micellar critical concentration. Cu was determined in solutions, sediments and in different plant tissues before and after experiments. Plant photosynthetic efficiency did not indicate deletory effects of the exposure to the added pollutants. The non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 and, to a lesser extent, the anionic surfactant SDS too, favored Cu accumulation in the plant roots but not Cu translocation, indicating that surfactants may favor Cu adsorption to the roots (phytostabilization). On the other hand, both surfactants favored Cu solubility from the sediment. Therefore, the presence of surfactants, which are frequently found in estuarine areas, as a result of urban and industrial effluent discharges, may condition metal distribution in those environments.

M3  - Article
AB  - The decade-long USA research program on the direct effects of CO2 enrichment on vegetation has achieved important milestones and has produced a number of interesting and exciting findings. Research beginning in 1980 focused on field experiments to determine whether phenomena observed in the laboratory indeed occurred in natural environments. The answer is yes. Data obtained from numerous field studies show mixed response of crop and native species to CO2 enrichment however. Nearly all experiments demonstrate that plants exhibit positive gain when grown at elevated CO2; although the magnitude varies greatly. Most crop responses range from 30 to 50 % increase in yield. Results from long-term experiments with woody species and ecosystems are even more variable. Huge growth responses (100 to nearly 300 % increase relative to controls) are reported from several tree experiments and the salt-marsh ecosystem experiment. Other results from experiments with woody species and the tundra ecosystem suggest little no effect of CO2 on physiology, growth or productivity. Numerous studies of the physiology of the CO2 effect are continuing in attempts to understand controlling mechanisms and to explain the variable growth responses. Particular emphasis needs to be given to physiological measures of interactions involving the CO2 effect and other environmental influences, and to the wide-ranging observations of photosynthesis acclimation to CO2. Prospects for future research are identified.

TI  - Microbial Community Composition and Denitrifying Enzyme Activities in Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Denitrifying microbial communities and denitrification in salt marsh sediments may be affected by many factors, including environmental conditions, nutrient availability, and levels of pollutants. The objective of this study was to examine how microbial community composition and denitrification enzyme activities (DEA) at a California salt marsh with high nutrient loading vary with such factors. Sediments were sampled from three elevations, each with different inundation and vegetation patterns, across 12 stations representing various salinity and nutrient conditions. Analyses included determination of cell abundance, total and denitrifier community compositions (by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism), DEA, nutrients, and eluted metals. Total bacterial (16S rRNA) and denitrifier (nirS) community compositions and DEA were analyzed for their relationships to environmental variables and metal concentrations via multivariate direct gradient and regression analyses, respectively. Community composition and DEA were highly variable within the dynamic salt marsh system, but each was strongly affected by elevation (i.e., degree of inundation) and carbon content as well as by selected metals. Carbon content was highly related to elevation, and the relationships between DEA and carbon content were found to be elevation specific when evaluated across the entire marsh. There were also lateral gradients in the marsh, as evidenced by an even stronger association between community composition and elevation for a marsh subsystem. Lastly, though correlated with similar environmental factors and selected metals, denitrifier community composition and function appeared uncoupled in the marsh.

TI  - A multi-biomarker approach supports the use of compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids to quantify basal carbon source use in a salt marsh consumer
T2  - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale Determining the flow of energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels in complex systems remains an important task for ecologists. Biomarkers can be used to trace carbon or energy sources contributing to an organism's tissues. However, different biomarkers vary in their ability to trace carbon sources based on how faithfully they transfer between trophic levels. Comparing emerging biomarker techniques with more commonly used techniques can demonstrate the relative efficacy of each in specific systems. Methods Two common biomarker techniques, fatty acid analysis (FAA) and bulk stable isotope analysis (SIA), and one emerging biomarker technique, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), were compared to assess their ability to characterize and quantify basal carbon sources supporting the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus), a common salt marsh species. Herbivorous insect and deposit-feeding fiddler crab biomarker values were analyzed as proxies of major terrestrial and aquatic basal carbon sources, respectively. Results All three biomarker techniques indicated that both terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources were important to seaside sparrows. However, FAA could only be evaluated qualitatively, due to a currently limited understanding of trophic modification of fatty acids between primary producer and this consumer's tissues. Quantitative stable isotope (SIA or CSIA-AA) mixing models predicted nearly equal contributions of terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources supporting seaside sparrows, yet estimates based on CSIA-AA had greater precision. Conclusions These findings support the use of CSIA-AA as an emerging tool to quantify the relative importance of basal carbon sources in salt marsh consumers. Integrating multiple biomarker techniques, with their differing benefits and limitations, will help to constrain models of carbon and energy flow in future ecosystem studies.

TI  - Dynamics of carbon sequestration in a coastal wetland using radiocarbon measurements
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - [ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient load into the ocean can be retained during the process of plant uptake and sedimentation in marshes along the bay zone. Seasonal variations of biomass and nutrient concentration in three dominated plant assemblages and associated sediments were monitored in this study area to determine effects of salt marsh on nutrient retention. Results showed that plant aboveground biomass displayed a unimodal curve with nutrient concentration generally decreased from spring to winter. Belowground biomass was relatively low during the rapid growth period with nutrient concentration tending to decrease and then increase during this period. Plant total nitrogen (TN) pools are higher than total phosphorus (TP) pools, and both pools showed significant seasonal variations. Water purification coefficients (WPC) of nutrients by plant assimilation were 34.4/17.3, 19.3/24.0, and 5.14/6.04 t/(m(2) year) (TN/TP) for Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, and Scirpus mariqueter, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that higher annual plant biomass and nutrient assimilation contribute to greater nutrient retention capacity and accumulation in sediments, thereby enabling reduced eutrophication in transitional waters.

TI  - Nitrogen transformation in wetlands and marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N) in wetlands and marshes is complex, involving inter-conversions between different N species, as well as transfers among various storage compartments. This review attempts to provide concise information on N dynamics in wetlands and marshes, and discuss contributing factors that may help to maximize removal of N from wastewater and stormwater runoffs at the same time reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to the atmosphere. In addition to interstitial water, N may be stored in above and belowground, live and dead plant material, invertebrates and microbes, and sorbed on the surfaces of organic and inorganic materials. The structure and functioning of the wetlands and marshes are subjected to anthropogenic activities, such as waterworks, land reclamation grazing and mowing, fertilization and various types of pollution, including heavy metals, nutrients, oil, etc. Nitrogen turnover in salt marshes is of particular interest since the primary production in salt marshes, as well as in adjacent coastal waters is considered to be limited by the supply of dissolved inorganic N. Salt marshes can function as sinks or as sources of N depending on their morphology and vegetation. Conversion pathways include ammonia volatilization, ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), dissimilatory reduction, and plant and microbial assimilation and remineralization during decomposition. The existence of an atmospheric sink, coupled with ammonia volatilization and microbially mediated nitrification and denitrification, make N as an excellent target for removal from wastewaters by constructed wetlands and marshes. However, such removal, specifically as N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere may not be as wise as previously thought as the concerns of global warming keeps looming. It is apparent that unless human-derived N inputs are regulated at the source, substantial biogeochemical modification of the global coastal ocean may occur because of cyclic processes within the coastal ocean system that are not rapid enough to dissipate the effects of the perturbations. Identifying the relative importance of various permanent and temporary sinks for N in wetlands may lead to methods of optimizing the utilization of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. The dynamics of N transformation within constructed wetlands is particularly a good candidate for long-term study to maximize the beneficial functions that wetlands can provide, and minimize adverse effects such as N2O emission to the atmosphere.

AB  - Panicum hemitomon, Spartina patens, and Spartina alterniflora are wide-spread dominant grasses of fresh, brackish, and salt marsh plant communities, respectively. Our previous research identified significant intraspecific variation in salt tolerance and morphology among populations within each species. In this study our objectives were to determine shorter-term physiological/biochemical responses to salinity stress and identify potential indicators of salt tolerance, with the ultimate goal of discerning similarities and differences in the mechanisms of salinity stress resistance. We subjected a subset of six populations within each species, ranging from high to low salt tolerance, to sublethal salinity levels (4, 20, and 30 ppt. respectively, for species) and monitored physiological and growth responses after 1 week (early harvest) and 5 weeks (late harvest). In all three species sublethal salinity levels generally resulted in significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation, leaf expansion, midday leaf xylem pressure, water use efficiency, and live and total biomass; and significantly increased leaf Na+/K+ ratio, leaf proline, leaf glycine betaine, leaf sucrose, root-to-shoot ratio, and dead:total aboveground biomass ratio. All three species displayed significant population (intraspecific) variation in net CO2 assimilation, leaf expansion, water use efficiency, midday leaf xylem pressure, leaf proline, leaf glycine betaine (except Panicum, where it could not be accurately determined), leaf Na+/K+ ratio, leaf sucrose, total plant biomass, dead:total aboveground biomass ratio, and root-to-shoot ratio. General indicators of salt tolerance (regardless of species) included high net CO2 assimilation rates and water use efficiencies, and low ratios of root-to-shoot and dead:total aboveground biomass. Factor analysis and a-priori linear contrasts revealed some unique differences between species in terms of the relative importance of morphology and physiology in explaining intraspecific variation in salt tolerance. Plant morphology (size attributes) were strongly associated with salt tolerance in P. hemitomon, weakly associated with salt tolerance in S. patens, and not associated with salt tolerance in S. alterniflora. Highly salt-tolerant populations of Spartina alterniflora displayed the greatest ion selectivity (lower leaf Na+/K+ ratios), which was not displayed by the other two species. These results suggest that plant size attributes can be very important in explaining population differences in salt tolerance in glycophytes, but may be independent of salt tolerance in halophytes, which have specialized physiological (and/or anatomical) adaptations that can confer salinity stress resistance through mechanisms such as selective ion exclusion and secretion.

CP  - 5th International Polychaete Conference
CL  - QINGDAO, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The effects of plant zonation on polychaete distribution and abundance were studied along an environmental gradient in intertidal flats of Paranagua Bay (SE Brazil). Two polychaete stocks with marked preference for specific haline regimes were recognized with a low degree of spatial overlap in species distribution. Species richness and abundance were lower in the mesohaline sector, characterized by fine sediments and high organic carbon content, than in the high-energy euhaline sector, dominated by moderately sorted fine sands low in organic carbon content. Faunal differences were primarily defined by salinity and environmental energy gradients and only secondarily by the ability of polychaetes to discriminate among unvegetated, salt marsh or mangrove swamp habitats.

TI  - Effect of tidal flooding on ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flooding is the basic hydrological feature of a salt marsh, and controls its ecosystem carbon exchange. However, the response of ecosystem carbon exchange to different stages of tidal flooding remains poorly documented. To further explore this issue, we conducted a field experiment to assess the effect of tidal stages (before flooding stage, rising tide stage, tidal flooding stage and after ebbing stage), water levels (a control, a low water level (LWL), a middle water level (MWL) and a high water level (HWL)) and soil salinity on ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the rising tide stage significantly inhibited the uptake of CO2 (LWL: 1.49 +/- 0.23 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 1.10 +/- 0.35 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.54 +/- 0.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Meanwhile, the rising tide stage also promoted CH4 emissions of MWL and HWL treatments (MWL: 0.97 +/- 0.36 nmol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.93 +/- 0.24 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). CH4 emissions of the after ebbing stage was higher than that of the before flooding stage, and this difference was significant of LWL and MWL treatments (LWL: 0.56 +/- 0.12 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 0.79 +/- 0.13 vs 0.40 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Moreover, ecosystem CO2 exchange of the HWL treatment was almost completely suppressed during tidal inundation period. During tidal inundation period, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was significantly positively correlated with water levels, but CH4 emissions was not significantly affected by water levels. In addition, the rate of CO2 uptake decreased linearly with soil salinity during the non-inundation period. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the carbon exchange process coupling with the complete tidal flooding process in future researches.

TI  - Valuing ecosystem services from blue forests: A systematic review of the valuation of salt marshes, sea grass beds and mangrove forests
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide a number of life-sustaining services, from which benefits to humans can be derived. They are often inhabited by aquatic vegetation, such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes. Given their wide geographic distribution and coverage, there is need to prioritize conservation efforts. An understanding of the human importance of these ecosystems can help with that prioritization. Here, we summarize a literature review of ecosystem service valuation studies. We discuss (1) the degree to which current valuation information is sufficient to prioritize blue carbon habitat conservation and restoration, (2) the relevancy of available studies, and (3) what is missing from the literature that would be needed to effectively prioritize conservation. Given the recent focus on blue carbon ecosystems in the international conservation, there are a number of areas where research on blue forest ecosystem assessment and valuation could be improved, from enhancing available methodologies to increasing valuation of rarely studied ecosystem services and wider geographic coverage of valuation studies. This review highlights these gaps and calls for a focus on broadening the ecosystem services that are valued, the methods used, and increasing valuation in underrepresented regions.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - As an easy and relevant assessment within communities and arguably the most important in relating a species to its environment are its trophic interactions. Food webs and food chains offer visualizations of organismal connections, usually in direct predator-prey interactions. Nevertheless, indirect interactions and non-predator-prey interactions are also important. Food resources are primary niche dimensions in terms of resources used (i.e., energy, material, and sites). As parts of food webs, predator-prey relationships are the primary source of negative feedback loops that stabilize communities. Simple models are excellent for small point-in-time studies or parsing diets of particular species; however, when relating any study to a larger whole, the environmental factors are also necessary to reflect the reality of processes. Tides, seasons, and other events can play a significant role in the primary and secondary production of salt marshes due to ontogenetic shifts of some species to different trophic levels. However, many species can operate at multiple feeding levels, and though adults of a species might be listed as feeding at a higher trophic level, the species' major influence on its community might occur as a juvenile at a different trophic level.

TI  - Impacts of human activity and extreme weather events on sedimentary organic matter in the Andong salt marsh, Hangzhou Bay, China
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, lignin-derived phenols, stable carbon isotopes and bulk elemental compositions were determined along the length of two sediment cores (Cl and C2) from the Andong salt marsh, which is located southwest of Hangzhou Bay, China. The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of nitrous oxide flux between coastal marsh and the atmosphere in the Yellow River estuary of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and understand the key controlling factors, we explored N2O fluxes and environmental variables in high marsh (HM), middle marsh (MM), low marsh (LM), and mudflat (MF) in the Yellow River estuary throughout a year. Fluxes of N2O differed significantly between sampling periods as well as between sampling positions. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O fluxes ranged from -0.0051 to 0.0805 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1), and high N2O emissions occurred during spring (0.0278 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (0.0139 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) while low fluxes were observed during summer (0.0065 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.0060 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average N2O flux from the intertidal zone was 0.0117 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1), and the cumulative N2O emission throughout a year was 113.03 mg N2O m(-2), indicating that coastal marsh acted as N2O source. Over all seasons, N2O fluxes from the four marshes were significantly different (p < 0.05), in the order of HM (0.0256 +/- 0.0040 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > MF (0.0107 +/- 0.0027 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > LM (0.0073 +/- 0.0020 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > MM (0.0026 +/- 0.0011 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)). Temporal variations of N2O emissions were related to the vegetations (Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Tamarix chinensis) and the limited C and mineral N in soils during summer and autumn and the frequent freeze/thaw cycles in soils during spring and winter, while spatial variations were mainly affected by tidal fluctuation and plant composition at spatial scale. This study indicated the importance of seasonal N2O contributions (particularly during non-growing season) to the estimation of local N2O inventory, and highlighted both the large spatial variation of N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh (CV = 158.31 %) and the potential effect of exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary on N2O emission should be considered before the annual or local N2O inventory was evaluated accurately.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasions reduce soil fungal diversity and simplify co-occurrence networks in a salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil fungal communities drive diverse ecological processes and are critical in maintaining ecosystems' stability, but the effects of plant invasion on soil fungal diversity, community composition, and functional groups are not well understood. Here, we investigated soil fungal communities in a salt marsh ecosystem with both native (Suaeda salsa) and exotic (Spartina alterniflora) species in the YellowRiver Delta. We characterized fungal diversity based on the PCR-amplified Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) DNA sequences from soil extracted total DNA. The plant invasion evidently decreased fungal richness and phylogenetic diversity and significantly altered the taxonomic community composition (indicated by the permutation test, P < 0.001). Co-occurrence networks between fungal species showed fewer network links but were more assembled because of the high modularity after the invasion. As indicated by the fungal Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac distances, the fungal community became homogenized with the invasion. FUNGuild database analyses revealed that the invaded sites had a higher proportion of saprophytic fungi, suggesting higher organic matter decomposition potential with the invasion. The plant invasion dramatically inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi, which may facilitate the expansion of invasive plants in the intertidal habitats. Soil pH and salinity were identified as the most important edaphic factors in shaping the fungal community structures in the context of Spartina alterniflora invasion. Overall, this study elucidates the linkage between plant invasion and soil fungal communities and poses potential consequences for fungal contribution to ecosystem function, including the decomposition of soil organic substrates.

TI  - Variability of dissolved organic matter in two coastal wetlands along the Changjiang River Estuary: Responses to tidal cycles, seasons, and degradation processes.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal tidal marsh-estuary systems are complex mixtures with different source materials that vary with hydrological regimes, seasons, and environmental conditions and are modified by removal processes including photochemical and microbial degradations. Here, monthly surveys of DOM and its optical properties (i.e., absorbance and fluorescence of DOM) covering a complete semi-diurnal tidal cycle were conducted in two coastal marshes with distinct hydrological regimes (i.e., one freshwater and one brackish marsh) in the Changjiang River Estuary (CRE). Four fluorescent components were identified by excitation-emission matrix fluoresces combined with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) as two terrestrial humic-like components and two autochthonous protein-like components. Results indicated that ebbing waters draining the marshes were consistently enriched with highly absorbing, more humic and highly aromatic DOM compared to the flood tidewaters. On a seasonal basis, DOM dynamics were largely modulated by the marsh productivity and the seasonal Changjiang runoff. Protein-like fluorophores, however, demonstrated a constant, less variable pattern on both the tidal and seasonal timescales. Onsite water incubation experiments with photochemical and microbial alterations revealed that photochemistry was primarily responsible for the removal of optically active components in the marsh DOM pools whereas the impact of microbes was minor. Principal component analysis (PCA) illustrated the processes regulating the DOM dynamics at the marsh-estuarine interface and allowed a clear distinction of samples between the two marshes, in addition to the samples under the influence of episodic weather events (i.e., Super Typhoon Lekima in summer 2009 and the basin-wide severe flood event occurred in summer 2020). This study underscores the importance of world large-rivers such as Changjiang on estuarine marsh DOM dynamics and also highlights the substantial heterogeneity of the marsh DOM across a river-dominated estuary.

TI  - A first approach to study the mobility and behavior of lead in hypersaline salt marsh sediments: Diffusive and advective fluxes, geochemical partitioning and Pb isotopes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A geochemical study of interstitial water and solid phase sediment using bulk concentration and geochemical partitioning was undertaken in vertical sediment profiles to trace diagenetic processes of lead (Pb) in hypersaline salt marsh sediments. In addition, we measured the stable isotopic composition of Pb in order to distinguish its input sources. Concentrations of Pb increased from low or background values in the bottommost layer (<60 cm depth), followed by fluctuations in the middle layer (20-60 cm) and peak values in the subsurface layer (3-5 cm). Pb associated to reactive fractions (e.g. OM, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates) accounted for 60% of that initially deposited. Stable Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-207/Pb-208) suggested that most of the Pb in the upper sediments (1.204 +/- 0.002 and 2.469 +/- 0.007) is still derived from the leaded gasoline combustion (1.201 +/- 0.006 and 2.475 +/- 0.005). Profile of dissolved Pb was related to those for ammonium, phosphates and dissolve Fe and Mn, which reveals the influence of the diagenetic reactions on the Pb behavior. OM. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and the sulfide minerals play a significant role for mobilizing and trapping the Pb. Metal mobilization was calculated considering an advective-diffusive system. The advective process constitutes the dominant mechanism of Pb mobilization. A low diffusive outflux with respect to the Pb mobilization rate suggested that most of the released Pb is retained in the sediments. Authigenic oxides precipitated at the oxic-suboxic layers (0-4 cm depth) and authigenic sulfide minerals formed Pb in the anoxic layers (7-20 cm depth) constituting the main scavengers for Pb that is diagenetically released. This retention has significant environmental implications because it reduces the availability and toxicity of Pb to biota, including humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An important biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling: Effects of organic alkalinity on carbonate chemistry in coastal waters influenced by intertidal salt marshes
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contains organic acid charge groups that contribute organic alkalinity (OrgAlk) to total alkalinity (TA). These effects are often ignored or treated as a calculation uncertainty in many aquatic CO2 studies. This study evaluated OrgAlk variability, sources, and characteristics in estuarine waters exchanged tidally with a groundwater-influenced salt marsh in the northeast USA. OrgAlk provided a biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling through its direct effects on pH, and thus CO2 system speciation and buffer capacity. Two main charge groups were identified including carboxylic and phenolic or amine groups. Terrestrial groundwater and in-situ production within salt marsh peat contributed OrgAlk to the tidal creek, with the former being a more significant source. Groundwater entering the marsh complex contained exceptionally high OrgAlk (> 150 mu mol kg(-1)), and these compounds were preferentially preserved within the DOC pool during groundwater transport and mixing with coastal water. OrgAlk:DOC ratios in groundwater and marshinfluenced water varied across space and time. This highlights the insufficiency of using a fixed proportion of DOC to account for organic acid charge groups. Accounting for OrgAlk altered H+ concentrations by similar to 1-41 nmol kg(-1)(equivalent to a pH change of similar to 0.03-0.26), pCO(2) by similar to 30-1600 mu atm and buffer capacity by similar to 0.00-0.14 mmol kg(-1) at the relative OrgAlk contributions of 0.9-4.3% of TA observed in the marsh-influenced tidal water. Thus, OrgAlk may have a significant influence on coastal inorganic carbon cycling. Further theoretical calculations confirm that these concentrations of OrgAlk would have sizable impacts on both carbonate speciation and, ultimately, air-sea CO2 fluxes in different coastal environments, ranging from estuarine to shelf waters. A new conceptual model linking organic and inorganic carbon cycling for coastal waters is proposed to highlight the sources and sinks of organic acid charge groups, as well as their biogeochemical behaviors and mechanistic control on the CO2 system.

TI  - ORGANIC-CARBON SOURCES AND SINKS IN SAN-FRANCISCO BAY - VARIABILITY INDUCED BY RIVER FLOW
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sources and sinks of organic carbon for San Francisco Bay (California, USA) were estimated for 1980. Sources for the southern reach were dominated by phytoplankton and benthic microalgal production. River loading of organic matter was an additional important factor in the northern reach. Tidal marsh export and point sources played a secondary role. Autochthonous production in San Francisco Bay appears to be less than the mean for temperate-zone estuaries, primarily because turbidity limits microalgal production and the development of seagrass beds. Exchange between the Bay and Pacific Ocean plays an unknown but potentially important role in the organic carbon balance. Interannual variability in the organic carbon supply was assessed for Suisun Bay, a northern reach subembayment that provides habitat for important fish species (delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and larval striped bass Morone saxatilus). The total supply fluctuated by an order of magnitude; depending on the year, either autochthonous sources (phytoplankton production) or allochthonous sources (riverine loading) could be dominant. The primary cause of the year-to-year change was variability of freshwater inflows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and its magnitude was much larger than long-term changes arising from marsh destruction and point source decreases. Although interannual variability of the total organic carbon supply could not be assessed for the southern reach, year-to-year changes in phytoplankton production were much smaller than in Suisun Bay, reflecting a relative lack of river influence.

TI  - Short-term effect of simulated salt marsh restoration by sand-amendment on sediment bacterial communities
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Effects of historic tidal restrictions on salt marsh sediment chemistry
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of tidal restrictions by diking on salt marsh biogeochemistry were interpreted by comparing the hydrology, porewater chemistry and solid phase composition of both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes with adjacent natural salt marshes on Cape God, Massachusetts. Flooding periods were greatest in natural and least in drained marshes.Differences between the chemistry of the natural and diked marshes depended upon the depth of the water table and the supply of sulfate for anaerobic metabolism. Drained marsh sediments were highly acidic (pH < 4) with porewaters rich in dissolved Fe; the natural and diked flooded marshes had pH 6-7.5 and Fe orders of magnitude lower. Porewater nutrients, sulfides and alkalinity were much lower in both flooded and drained diked marshes than in the natural marsh.Sediments of the drained marsh had subsided 90 cm relative to the natural site due to organic matter decomposition and compaction. However, despite the loss of organic matter, much of the P and N was retained, with NH4 likely protected from nitrification by low pH and PO4 adsorbed on Fe and Al oxides. Iron, and to a lesser degree sulfur, had also been well retained by the sediment. Despite eight decades of diking, substantial amounts of reduced S, representing potential acidity, persisted near the top of the water table.In contrast, the surface of the seasonally flooded marsh was only 15 cm below the natural marsh. Accretion since diking amounted to 25 cm and involved proportionally less mineral matter.The restoration of seawater flow to both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes will likely extend flooding depth and duration, lower redox, increase cation exchange, and thereby increase NH4, Fe(II), and PO4 mobilization. Increased porewater nutrients could benefit recolonizing halophytes but may also degrade surface water quality.

TI  - Rapid clay transformations in Delaware salt marshes
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are the major areas for net sedimentation in many estuaries such as the Delaware Bay, and their diagenetic chemistry is harsh and extreme with large seasonal excursions in chlorinity (1-50 ppt), pH (4-6), and Eh (-240 + 120). Such diagenesis is driven by organic matter decomposition using redox cycles of S and Fe materials imported primarily as tidal sea water SO4 and Fe silicates, respectively.Important and quantitative changes in clay mineralogy occur within a decade at the redox boundary in a high marsh sediment near Lewes, Delaware. The clay mineralogy consists initially of a micaceous illite and chlorite mixture accumulating at the salt marsh surface. It is comprised of relic glacial sediments deposited on the continental slope during their net tidal movement from the sea to land. Once buried, these detrital clays are transformed into a new assemblage containing an illite/smectitic mixed layer mineral of poor crystallinity. Using curve decomposition techniques on complex X-ray traces, it is estimated that this new phase constitutes 45-55% of the clay fraction.The redox boundary where the sharp transition occurs is only about 20 a old as determined by Pb-210 and Cs-137 geochronology, and, thus, the clay mineral transformation is rapid. The occurrence of the new, abundant clay mineral is very abrupt (less than 1 cm at 12 cm in depth) and, thus, may itself occur in as little as three years. Once formed, the new mixed layer phase remains stable during the subsequent 40 a of burial from the time of formation at the oxic/anoxic boundary.Slow transformations of unstable primary clay reactants such as illite and chlorite are a common process of soil formation. However such rapid clay reactions have rarely been documented in either subaerial or submerged soil settings. The formation of a smectite mineral product of high chemical reactivity for a significant portion of the clays in a soil is unusual. In fact, the abrupt change in clay mineralogy in the salt marsh occurs precisely at the sharp evolution in salt marsh geochemistry from oxidized to reducing conditions where there is extensive redox cycling of Fe and S phases. A large seasonal oscillation in interstitial pH and Eh probably contributes to the rapid clay transformation. Such clay transformations may have important implications for the retention of other trace elements entering the salt marsh by atmospheric fallout and tidal cycles, or the release of such metal inventories after burial.

T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics are widely dispersed in the coastal and marine environment, and sediments are considered to be sinks for microplastics. In this study, a total of 53 sediment samples were removed from different depths of two sediment cores collected in Andong salt marsh, Hangzhou Bay. The microplastics were extracted from the sediment cores through a density floating separation method. The shape, size, and color of the microplastics was then observed under a microscope. Polymer types were identified using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average abundance of microplastics was 13.2 +/- 6.0 items 50 g(-1) dry weight. The main components of microplastics were polystyrene, cellophane, polyethylene and polypropylene. The quantities of microplastics at different depths in the sediment cores were consistent with the history of microplastic pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biogeomorphic impact of oligochaetes (Annelida) on sediment properties and Salicornia spp. seedling establishment
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oligochaetes (Annelida) are active bioturbators that can be present in high densities in the transition zone between intertidal flats and salt marshes, though their occurrence and functional role remain understudied. This study aimed to clarify the biogeomorphic role of oligochaete bioturbation in facilitating or hindering vegetation establishment. Two microcosm experiments were performed to assess the effect of oligochaete bioturbation on sediment properties, oxidation depth, algal biomass, seed distribution, and germination success of pioneer species Salicornia spp. Oligochaetes created burrow networks in the sediment matrix, which, together with upward conveyor belt feeding, lead to substrate mixing. Sediment reworking rates of oligochaetes were compared with those of polychaete macrofauna. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation of burrows can stimulate resource flows into the sediment. Oxidation depth increased almost tenfold in the presence of oligochaetes. Their bioturbation did not seem to affect sediment properties such as dry bulk density, porosity, and organic matter content. Sediment reworking, however, significantly reduced algal biomass at the surface with possible cascading effects on sediment stability and erodibility. Oligochaete conveyor belt feeding buried Salicornia spp. seeds until below the critical germination depth, thus negatively affecting Salicornia spp. germination and seedling establishment. Our study indicates that small, though numerous, oligochaete bioturbators may reduce lateral expansion potential of salt marshes by hindering the establishment of pioneer vegetation in the transition zone. Additionally, in dynamic fine-grained habitats, these oligochaetes have the feature to quickly oxygenate the sediment top layer.

TI  - CANOPY PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF CROPS AND NATIVE PLANT-COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO LONG-TERM ELEVATED CO2
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - There have been seven studies of canopy photosynthesis of plants grown in elevated atmospheric CO2: three of seed crops, two of forage crops and two of native plant ecosystems. Growth in elevated CO2 increased canopy photosynthesis in all cases. The relative effect of CO2 was correlated with increasing temperature: the least stimulation occurred in tundra vegetation grown at an average temperature near 10-degrees-C and the greatest in rice grown at 43-degrees-C. In soybean, effects of CO2 were greater during leaf expansion and pod fill than at other stages of crop maturation. In the longest running experiment with elevated CO2 treatment to date, monospecific stands of a C3 sedge, Scirpus olneyi (Grey), and a C4 grass, Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl., have been exposed to twice normal ambient CO2 concentrations for four growing seasons, in open top chambers on a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange per unit green biomass (NCE(b)) increased by an average of 48% throughout the growing season of 1988, the second year of treatment. Elevated CO2 increased net ecosystem carbon assimilation by 88% in the Scirpus olneyi community and 40% in the Spartina patens community.

TI  - Submergence and Herbivory as Divergent Causes of Marsh Loss in Long Island Sound
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marsh degradation has been attributed to a number of different causes, but few studies have examined multiple potential factors at the same sites. Differentiating the diverse drivers of marsh loss is critical to prescribing successful interventions for conservation and restoration of this important habitat. We evaluated two hypotheses for vegetation loss at two marshes in Long Island Sound (LIS): (1) marsh submergence, caused by an imbalance between sea-level rise and marsh accretion, and (2) defoliation associated with herbivory by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum. At our western LIS site, we found no evidence of herbivory: crabs were scarce, and crab-exclusion cages provided no benefit. We attribute degradation at that site to submergence, a conclusion supported by topographic and hydrologic data showing that loss of vegetation occurred only in wetter parts of the marsh. In contrast, at our central LIS site, our observations were consistent with herbivory as a driving force: There were substantial populations of Sesarma, crab-exclusion cages allowed plants to thrive, and vegetation loss took place across a variety of elevations. We also analyzed soil conditions at both sites, in order to determine the signatures of different degradation processes and assess the potential for restoration. At the submergence site, unvegetated soils exhibited high bulk density, low organic content, and low soil strength, posing significant biogeochemical challenges to re-colonization by vegetation. At the herbivory site, unvegetated soils had a characteristic "riddled-peat" appearance, resulting from expansion and erosion of Sesarma burrow networks. The high redox potential and organic content of those soils suggested that revegetation at the herbivory site would be likely if Sesarma populations could be controlled before erosion leads to elevation loss.

TI  - Seasonal analyses of arbuscular mycorrhizae, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and growth performance of the salt marsh grass Spartina patens
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in roots of the high salt marsh plant Spartina patens, the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere and plant growth performance was studied at key stages of the growing season coinciding with major plant phenological stages, i.e., vegetative growth, reproduction and senescence. AMF colonization was highest during vegetative growth, with values declining during the growing season to the same level seen at plant dormancy. AMF colonization was reduced at lower depths in the sediments where anoxic conditions were observed and in plants treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl. Only small changes in diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in general and more specifically of those belonging to the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria were detected during the season or between treatments by PCR-RFLP of nifH gene fragments with DNA as template for amplification; however, greater seasonal changes were displayed when cDNA was used as template for amplification as a proxy for gene expression and thus active bacteria. DGGE analyses of nifH gene fragments representing nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria using both using DNA and cDNA as template showed highly diverse profiles that changed during the season and in response to treatment. Seasonal changes were observed for a suite of plant growth attributes and differences were observed between treatments, with higher values generally obtained on non-treated plants compared to Benomyl-treated plants. These differences were most pronounced during vegetative growth; however, differences between non-treated and Benomyl-treated plants were reduced seasonally and disappeared by the onset of senescence. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in AMF colonization on S. patens and in the community structure of nitrogen-fixing members of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria in the plant root zone. Plant growth performance changed seasonally with some effects of Benomyl-treatment.

TI  - Patterns of canopy-air CO2 concentration in a brackish wetland: analysis of a decade of measurements and the simulated effects on the vegetation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetic carbon assimilation is dependent on the canopy-air CO2 concentration (Ca), which is an essential driving parameter of mechanistic models built to predict plant responses to changing environmental conditions. Short-term studies have shown that crop-canopy Ca undergoes substantial diurnal and seasonal variations as compared to Ca values measured several meters above plant canopies in well mixed conditions. Whether these canopy Ca patterns measured in crops also apply to wetland plant canopies and over long periods of time remains largely unknown. The first objective of this study was to analyze the consistency of short- and long-term Ca patterns in salt marsh canopies over a 10-year period. The second objective was to assess the impact of these canopy Ca patterns on simulated ecosystem productivity. In this study, we used Ca data collected from 1990 to 2000 in salt marsh canopies of the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The possible effects of short- and long-term canopy Ca patterns on plant productivity were simulated with a mechanistic model specifically adapted to the Scirpus olneyi vegetation of the salt marsh ecosystem. The annual average of daytime canopy Ca of a brackish marsh community rose by a significant (P < 0.01) 1.55 mumol CO2 mol(-1) year(-1) between 1990 and 2000, which parallels the atmospheric records of Mauna Loa over the same period of time. Annual Ca averages displayed some variability around this trend, which were highly correlated with the year-to-year variation in aboveground plant biomass (r(2) = 0.83, P < 0.001). Therefore, our study demonstrated that aboveground plant biomass is the main driver for inter-annual canopy Ca fluctuations. Daytime canopy Ca displayed maximum values in May and September and minimum values in July, with an amplitude of about 20 mumol CO2 mol(-1). The amplitude of the diurnal Ca cycle measured at the wetland appeared similar to that of North American agricultural ecosystems, exceeding 100 mumol CO2 mol(-1) in July and August and characterized by a sharp drop in the CO2 concentration shortly after dawn. Model simulations suggested that the increase in canopy Ca from 1990 to 2000 resulted in a substantial increase in Scirpus gross plant productivity (GPP) of 0.31% per year, which confirms that plant ecosystem simulations need to consider the actual increase in canopy Ca when the simulated time period exceeds a few years. Forcing the model with the measured diurnal Ca pattern increased the simulated net plant productivity (NPP) immediately after dawn and decreased it for the rest of the daytime period, which resulted in a simulated net NPP decrease of about 5% over the growing season.

TI  - Primary production and carrying capacity of former salt ponds after reconnection to San Francisco Bay
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 6.110 ha of the commercial production salt ponds surrounding South San Francisco Bay, CA, have been decommissioned and reconnected to the bay, most as part of the largest wetlands restoration program in the western United States. These open water ponds are critical habitat for millions of birds annually and restoration program managers must determine the appropriate balance between retention of ponds versus re-conversion to tidal salt marsh, knowing that both are essential ecosystems for endangered bird species. Our study describes the ecological value of the new open water pond ecosystems as feeding habitats for birds. We used the oxygen rate of change method to determine ecosystem metabolic parameters from high resolution time-series of dissolved oxygen concentration. Areal gross primary production (8.17 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was roughly double the world's most productive estuaries. High rates of phytoplankton photosynthesis were balanced by equally high rates of community respiration (8.25 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). Metabolic equilibrium was delicately poised; sharp irradiance and temperature shifts triggered short term photosynthesis reduction resulting in oxygen depletion. We converted net primary production (NPP) into potential carrying capacity of the forage biota that support targeted pond waterbirds. NPP was processed through both a pelagic food web, resulting in forage biota for piscivorous birds and a benthic food web, resulting in forage biota for shorebirds and diving benthivores. Both food webs included efficient algal-based and inefficient detrital trophic pathways. The result of all primary production being routed through simple food webs was high potential forage production and energy supply to waterbirds, equivalent to 11-163 million planktivorous fish or 19-78 billion small estuarine clams within the 330-ha pond between May and October. food quantity does not necessarily equal quality and these systems have the potential to produce toxic or inedible algae. Our study provides the first measurement of primary production in the open water ponds of San Francisco Bay and presents a novel approach for transforming primary production into forage production as a metric of an ecosystem's energetic carrying capacity.

TI  - Seasonal and spatial variations of methane emissions from coastal marshes in the northern Yellow River estuary, China
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the seasonal and spatial variations of methane (CH4) emissions and understand the controlling factors, we measured CH4 fluxes and their environmental variables for the first time by a static chamber technique in high Suaeda salsa marsh (HSM), middle S. salsa marsh (MSM), low S. salsa marsh (LSM) and bare flat (BF) in the northern Yellow River estuary throughout a year.CH4 emissions from coastal marsh varied throughout different times of the day and significant differences were observed in some sampling periods (p < 0.05). Over all sampling periods, CH4 fluxes averaged between -0.392 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and 0.495 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), and emissions occurred during spring (0.008 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.068 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed during summer (-0.110 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (-0.009 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). CH4 fluxes from the four marshes were not significantly different (p > 0.05), and emissions occurred in LSM (0.026 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and BF (0.055 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed in HSM (-0.035 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and MSM (-0.022 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average CH4 flux from the intertidal zone was 0.002 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), indicating that coastal marsh acted as a weak CH4 source. Temporal variations of CH4 emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (temperatures, soil moisture and salinity) and the variations of limited C and mineral N in sediments, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.This study observed a large spatial variation of CH4 fluxes across the coastal marsh of the Yellow River estuary (CV = 7856.25 %), suggesting that the need to increase the spatial replicates at fine scales before the regional CH4 budget was evaluated precisely. With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.

TI  - The role of cyanobacteria in Southern California salt marsh food webs
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding wetland food webs is critical for effective habitat management, restoration and conservation. Microalgae are recognized as key food sources for marsh invertebrates but the importance of different groups under various conditions is rarely examined. We tested the hypothesis that faunal utilization of microalgae, and cyanobacteria in particular, is significant in Southern California created and natural salt marshes but varies with habitat type (creek bank versus marsh interior) and season (spring versus autumn). We used stable isotope analysis and mixing models (IsoSource) to compare food webs in adjacent young (created) and mature (natural) salt marshes. Isotopic values of some primary producers, macrofauna, epifauna, and fish demonstrated significant differences between the adjacent salt marshes. delta C-13 and delta S-34 values of the benthic microalgal community varied with taxonomic composition (diatoms versus cyanobacteria) and to a lesser extent with season. Depleted delta N-15 values of benthic diatoms and macroalgae indicated that N-2 fixed within algal mats was recycled within the benthic algal community. Marsh fauna, including most major macrofauna taxal, Cerithidea, and Fundulus, also exhibited seasonal differences in isotopic composition, and Cerithidea and selected macrofauna (oligochaetes, polychaetes) from the marsh interior were more enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15 than those from the creek bank. In the young marsh, the cyanobacteria contributed a minimum of 17-100% of the primary production in food webs supporting macrofauna, and cyanobacteria contributed at least 40% of the primary production included in Cerithidea and Fundulus food webs. A wider range of primary producers contributed to food webs in the mature marsh. Cyanobacteria were a greater source of trophic support for macrofauna from the marsh interior than the creek bank, whereas Spartina was a more important food source for creek bank macrofauna in both marshes. Insect larvae largely consumed cyanobacteria, whereas polychaetes exhibited greater utilization of Spartina. Phytoplankton was the primary food resource for mussels in both marshes. Although the spatial and temporal complexity of food webs has traditionally been collapsed into the study of relatively simplified food webs, isotope signatures reveal fine-scale patterns in food web structure that may be used to make more accurate assessments of ecosystem state. Accurate interpretation of marsh trophic structure using natural abundance stable isotopes requires fine-scale resolution in space and time, a large number of samples, and a high level of taxonomic resolution.

TI  - MAGNITUDE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTHROPOGENIC CONTAMINANTS IN SALT-MARSH SEDIMENTS OF THE ESSEX COAST, UK .2. SELECTED METALS AND METALLOIDS
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Total concentrations of selected metals and metalloids; As, Ca, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn were determined in the sediments of five salt marsh sites along the Essex coast of the UK. A fairly ubiquitous degree of metal and metalloid contamination was found within the sediments of all the salt marshes investigated. The extent of contamination by individual metal species was dependent upon the nature of the site-specific inputs. The enrichment of industrially derived metals, such as Hg and Cd, for example, occurred at sites adjacent to urban areas; Two Tree Island (situated on the outer Thames Estuary) and to a lesser extent South Woodham Ferrers (situated on the River Crouch). Lead concentrations were elevated at all five sites inferring that a significant input was derived from a common generic source, such as atmospheric deposition. The distribution of metals and metalloids within individual salt marsh sites was dependent upon a number of factors including sediment type, the hydrological regime, the presence of vegetation, redox potential and organic matter content.

TI  - Macrophyte disturbance alters aquatic surface microlayer structure, metabolism, and fate
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophytes drive the functioning of many salt marsh ecosystem components. We questioned how temporary clearing of the macrophyte community, during restoration, would impact processes at the scale of the aquatic surface microlayer. Development, deposition, and breakup of the tidal creek surface microlayer were followed over tidal cycles seasonally in a cleared "former" Phragmites marsh and an adjacent restored Spartina marsh. Metabolic and physical processes of the mobile surface microlayers and underlying water were compared, along with distribution of organic and inorganic components onto simulated plant stems. In July and October, chlorophyll-a quantities were less on simulated stems in the cleared site than in the restored site. The aquatic microlayer in the cleared site creek exhibited lower photosynthesis and respiration rates, fewer diatoms and green algae, and less chlorophyll-a. There was a lower concentration (250 times) and reduced diversity of fatty acids in the surface microlayer of the cleared site, reflecting a smaller and less diverse microbial community and reduced food resources. Fiddler crab activity was an order of magnitude higher where macrophytes had been cleared. Their consumption of edaphic algae on the mud surface may account for the reduced algae and other organics in the creek surface microlayer, thus representing a redirection of this food resource from creek consumers. Overall, there were less total particulates in the creek surface microlayer at the cleared site, and they dropped out of the surface microlayer sooner in the tidal cycle, resulting in a lower sediment load available for deposit onto marsh surfaces.

TI  - Denitrification potential and its relation to organic carbon quality in three coastal wetland soils
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Capacity of a wetland to remove nitrate through denitrification is controlled by its physicochemical and biological characteristics. Understanding these characteristics will help better to guide beneficial use of wetlands in processing nitrate. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and denitrification rate in Louisiana coastal wetlands. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from three different wetlands along a salinity gradient, namely, bottomland forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM) located in the Barataria Basin estuary. Potential denitrification rate (PDR) was measured by acetylene inhibition method and distribution of carbon (C) moieties in organic C was determined by C-13 solid-state NMR. Of the three wetlands, the FM soil profile exhibited the highest PDR on both unit weight and unit volume basis as compared to FS and SM. The FM also tended to yield higher amount of N2O as compared to the FS and SM especially at earlier stages of denitrification, suggesting incomplete reduction of NO3- at FM and potential for emission of N2O. Saline marsh soil profile had the lowest PDR on the unit volume basis. Increasing incubation concentration from 2 to 10 mg NO3--N L-1 increased PDR by 2 to 6 fold with the highest increase in the top horizons of FS and SM soils. Regression analysis showed that across these three wetland systems, organic C has significant effect in regulating PDR. Of the compositional C moieties, polysaccharides positively influenced denitrification. rate whereas phenolics (likely phenolic adehydes and ketonics) negatively affected denitrification rate in these wetland soils. These results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of wetlands for treating nutrient-rich biosolids and wastewaters, non-point source agricultural runoff, and nitrate found in the diverted Mississippi River water used for coastal restoration.

TI  - A laboratory study on biochemical degradation and microbial utilization of organic matter comprising a marine diatom, land grass, and salt marsh plant in estuarine ecosystems
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the biochemical degradation of organic matter comprising marine diatom, land grass, and salt marsh plant in estuarine ecosystems in two laboratory microcosms consisting of estuarine sediments and coastal seawater. The materials were incubated separately and together under controlled oxic and anoxic conditions to test effects of co-metabolism and redox on overall degradation of organic matter. We followed variations of bulk parameters [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, delta C-13(TOC), and delta N-15(TN)], fatty acid concentrations, and compound-specific delta C-13 values over 3 months. Coexistence of marine diatom (relatively labile) with land grass/salt marsh plant (relatively refractory) in the microcosms yielded a negative co-metabolism effect (retardation rather than acceleration) on the overall degradation of organic matter. The ratios of oxic to anoxic degradation rate constants (k (ox)/k (an)) of TOC and most fatty acids were in a range of 1.1-1.7, implying that redox conditions per se had a limited influence on degradation of fresh organic materials in estuarine ecosystems. Variations of two bacteria-specific fatty acids (iso- and anteiso-15:0) and their delta C-13 values indicated that bacterial metabolism could use organic carbon (OC) from any available material when only one single-source material was dominant in the ecosystems. However, bacteria probably utilized OC preferentially from labile marine diatom when multiple-source materials were almost equally present in the ecosystems.

TI  - Drought alters the spatial distribution, grazing patterns, and radula morphology of a fungal-farming salt marsh snail
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering consumer- plant interactions in ecosystems worldwide. How consumers alter their spatial distribution, grazing activities, and functional morphology in response to climate stress can determine whether their effects on plants intensify or relax. Few studies have considered multiple consumer response metrics to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the resulting changes in consumer- plant interactions. Here, we tested how drought stress influences the interaction between the dominant consumer, the fungal-farming periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata, and a foundational plant, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, in a southeastern US salt marsh. In a 4 mo field experiment, we maintained moderate snail densities in mesh control chambers and clear plastic climate chambers that simulated drought by elevating temperatures and drying soils. Monitoring revealed that snails more often congregated on cordgrass stems than leaves in climate chambers than in controls. Image analyses indicated that this behavioral shift corresponded to snails inflicting shorter, but more numerous, fungal-infested scars on cordgrass leaves, and causing less plant damage in climate chambers than controls. Coincident with their net reduction in grazing, snails maintained longer radulae, whose central teeth were blunter and lateral teeth were sharper, in climate chambers compared to controls. These results suggest that under drought, snail radulae may experience less frictional wear and that, at intermediate densities, snail-cordgrass interactions relax. Together with prior research showing that at high densities, snails can denude cordgrass during drought, we conclude that consumer density, behavior, and morphological responses must be integrated in predictions of how climate change will affect the direction, strength, and stability of consumer-plant interactions.

T2  - Proceedings of the Nova Scotian Institute of Science
M3  - Article
AB  - In the salt marshes along the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, large standing crops of plant biomass are developed during the spring and summer when relatively high levels of primary production are maintained. The effect of this fixed C (both particulate and dissolved) on the open Bay of Fundy is difficult to determine. The organic C in the sediment and in the interstitial or pore waters were measured using methods which are described. There were large differences in measured organic matter between the 2 physically different marshes studied. Although the influence of such areas on production in the Bay of Fundy cannot be estimated from this preliminary study, the high organic levels observed indicate that marsh areas may be a source of organic matter.

TI  - Modeling Tidal Marsh Distribution with Sea-Level Rise: Evaluating the Role of Vegetation, Sediment, and Upland Habitat in Marsh Resiliency
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Tidal marshes maintain elevation relative to sea level through accumulation of mineral and organic matter, yet this dynamic accumulation feedback mechanism has not been modeled widely in the context of accelerated sea-level rise. Uncertainties exist about tidal marsh resiliency to accelerated sea-level rise, reduced sediment supply, reduced plant productivity under increased inundation, and limited upland habitat for marsh migration. We examined marsh resiliency under these uncertainties using the Marsh Equilibrium Model, a mechanistic, elevation-based soil cohort model, using a rich data set of plant productivity and physical properties from sites across the estuarine salinity gradient. Four tidal marshes were chosen along this gradient: two islands and two with adjacent uplands. Varying century sea-level rise (52, 100, 165, 180 cm) and suspended sediment concentrations (100%, 50%, and 25% of current concentrations), we simulated marsh accretion across vegetated elevations for 100 years, applying the results to high spatial resolution digital elevation models to quantify potential changes in marsh distributions. At low rates of sea-level rise and mid-high sediment concentrations, all marshes maintained vegetated elevations indicative of mid/high marsh habitat. With century sea-level rise at 100 and 165 cm, marshes shifted to low marsh elevations; mid/high marsh elevations were found only in former uplands. At the highest century sea-level rise and lowest sediment concentrations, the island marshes became dominated by mudflat elevations. Under the same sediment concentrations, low salinity brackish marshes containing highly productive vegetation had slower elevation loss compared to more saline sites with lower productivity. A similar trend was documented when comparing against a marsh accretion model that did not model vegetation feedbacks. Elevation predictions using the Marsh Equilibrium Model highlight the importance of including vegetation responses to sea-level rise. These results also emphasize the importance of adjacent uplands for long-term marsh survival and incorporating such areas in conservation planning efforts.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - SOM (soil organic matter) and N (nitrogen) are important ecological factors in coastal wetland ecosystems. A specific area in Yancheng coastal wetlands was chosen and monitored on the spot in April 2012, spatial distribution characteristics of SOM and N and the relationship between them were analysed. The results showed that the content of SOM and N differs significantly in various vegetation types, their content in Spartina marshes is the highest, followed by Reed marshes, Suaeda marshes and the mudflat. The average content of SOM and N in them were 1.138%, 1.103%, 0.851%, 0.399% and the average value of total nitrogen were 489.935 mg/kg, 369.811 mg/kg, 365.491 mg/kg, and 95.542 mg/kg respectively. Furthermore, SOM and TN (total nitrogen), TN and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in the coastal wetlands are closely related and fit perfectly for linear regression equation, however, the correlation coefficient for OM (organic matter)and NH3-N is low and fits well for the cubic curve equation. The specific value of carbon and nitrogen are the highest in the mudflat, followed by Reed marshes, Spartina marshes and Suaeda marshes. The specific value of NH3-N and TN are the highest in the mudflat and in Spartina marshes, Reed marshes and Suaeda marshes are close to it. Vegetation coverage conditions and physiological characteristics of plants are important factors affecting spatial distribution of SOM/N in coastal wetlands.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Annual Meeting on Soil and Crop Science
CL  - TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA
AB  - The USDA/SCS in 1984 determined that there were 26 ecological communities in Florida. Using soil series names and possible plants in specific ecological communities from this study, sites were chosen from a soil characterization study. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the approximate relative natural background P concentrations in the A horizon of six ecological communities; 2) to group the ecological communities according to P concentration and 3) to correlate other soil parameters to P concentrations. Eighty-nine surface soils (A horizons) from six of these communities which included freshwater marshes, swamp, hardwoods, salt water marshes, south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs were selected. The communities had water table depths <1 m. Some communities were submerged under water part of the year. Geometric means of total soil P (TP) using a hypobromite determination ranged from 23 mg kg(-1) in the sloughs to 438 mg kg(-1) in the salt marshes. Soil extractable P (EP) using Mehlich I extracting solution ranged from 4.7 mg kg(-1) in the north Florida flatwoods to 64.5 mg kg(-1) in the salt water marshes. Using statistical analysis, the six communities could be separated in distinct groups. Using TP, the first group included swamp hardwoods, fresh water marshes and salt marshes, and the second group was south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs. A similar relationship was found for the EP. The correlation coefficient between EP and TP was r = 0.77. Correlations with other soil properties (clay, organic carbon, total Al, total Fe, total Ca) were also made, and the communities were found to be grouped in the same way as they did with EP and TP. This suggests that ecological communities can be grouped according to soil characteristics.

TI  - Coastal wetland stability maintained through counterbalancing accretionary responses to chronic nutrient enrichment
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The link between anthropogenically modified nutrient loading and coastal wetland stability is not well understood due to limited data from long-term experiments and inconsistent findings from investigations thus far. In this study, we present results from a 13-year oligohaline marsh fertilization experiment aimed at determining whether eutrophic conditions compromise ecosystem stability, defined here as the capacity to keep pace with sea level rise and resist the erosive forces of high-energy meteorologic events. To accomplish this objective, we measured soil surface elevation change and soil shear strength, along with a suite of regulatory processes that included belowground standing crop, belowground decomposition, organic and mineral matter accumulation, soil accretion, and shallow subsidence. Our results identified an apparent compensatory effect of nutrient enrichment on accretionary processes whereby shallow subsidence, attributed to reduced live root standing crop, was balanced by enhanced accretion resulting from greater organic matter accumulation at the soil surface. Consequently, the rate of marsh elevation change measured over a five-year period was unaffected after more than a decade of experimental nutrient enrichment. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the soil matrix did not deteriorate under elevated nutrient conditions; decomposition rates were similar to control plots, and although live root standing crop was reduced, the root system was evidently stronger, as soil strength tended to increase rather than decrease after nutrients were provided for 13 years. Our data suggest that enhanced nutrient loading is an unlikely destabilizing mechanism in this coastal marsh and possibly others. However, additional long-term research will be required in a diverse range of habitats and environmental settings before broad-based, general conclusions concerning the effects of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland stability can be made with a high degree of certainty.

TI  - THE STOCKS OF ORGANIC CARBON IN THE BLOCK "LITTER - SOIL" OF POLISSIA REGIONPINE ECOSYSTEMS
T2  - VISNYK OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV-GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of studies of the content and stocks of organic carbon in the block "litter soil" of pine ecosystems in Zhytomyr and Chernihiv Polissia are presented. The forest ecosystems are important stabilizers of the carbon cycle as well as stocks of carbon. The components of the forest ecosystem are interconnected by the flows of energy and substances. Binding CO2 in the block of "plant-soil", followed by the transformation of carbon into insoluble humus compounds is of particular importance. In the research area sod - light-podzolic and sod-medium-podzolic soils on fluvioglacial sands are mostly spread. These soils belong to the category of old arable ones. Present here are also peat marsh soils. It is shown that the process of humus accumulation is characterized by low intensity, which is caused by a complex of reasons, in particular, the sandy composition of sod-podzolic soils (particle content < 0,01 mm 7,5 %).The thickness of the profile humus portion is 18 cm. The average content of humus is 0,97 %, and reserves 28,3 t/ha in a 20-cm layer. Similar indicators of carbon are 0,56 % and 16,4 t/ha, respectively. Organic substance of sod-podzolic soils of pine habitats is resistant to mineralization and for a long time is removed from the cycle of substances of the pine ecosystem. The average carbon content in hydromorphic organogenic soils increases to 18,1 % and its stocks are 168,9 t/ha. The ability for mineralization peat soils is lower than that of sod-podzolic soils. So, they have a high carbon sequestration capacity. Pine litter reserves on the average are 30-33 t/ha, and carbon reserves on the average are 12,6 t/ha, with its stable content 40 %.The total carbon reserves in the block "litter soil" of a typical pine ecosystem of Polissia are on average 29 t/ha, with the bulk of them being concentrated in the soil. Considering that highly productive pine forests are formed on the infertile soils of Polissia, their afforestation will not only stop the intensive degradation of soils of Ukraine, but also will increase the deposition of greenhouse gases, which will help to prevent further climate change at the regional level.

TI  - The Southwest Atlantic intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice granulata modifies nutrient loads of phreatic waters entering coastal area
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the coastal areas of the Southwest Atlantic estuaries and embayments, phreatic water often circulates through very extended areas (up to several hundred meters perpendicular to the coast), dominated by dense assemblages of deep burrows of the crab Neohelice granulata (formerly Chasmagnathus granulatus). This crab inhabits the intertidal area, from mudflats to marshes vegetated by species of Spartina, Sarcocornia and Juncus, generating extensive burrowing beds where burrow density may reach LIP to 60 burrows m(-2). Since the lower limit of the crab burrows is usually the water table, we investigated through field experiments the effect of N. granulata and their burrows on the chemical characteristics of this phreatic water. Water analysis from experimental (1) occupied burrows (with crabs), (2) unoccupied burrows (where crabs were excluded), and (3) sediment pore water show remarkable differences. Water oxygenation, and nitrate, ammonium and sulphate concentrations inside occupied burrows were higher than in the water inside unoccupied burrows or pore waters. Moreover, directed sampling of phreatic water entering and leaving the crab bed, shows that dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration is enhanced as the water crosses the crab bed. These results may be ascribed to the fact that in the salt marsh the crabs spend most of their time within burrows, where presumably they store food (plants) and defecate. These activities generate an area of accumulation of excrements and nutrients in different decomposition states. The present work shows a novel way by which bioturbating organisms can affect nutrients exportation from salt marshes to the open waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the richness and abundance of soil fauna as well as its vertical distribution on a periodically flooded sandbank area ("restinga") in Marambaia Island - RJ, in two season (summer - rainy and winter-dry). Litter and soil was sampled (0-5 cm), from which fauna was extracted by Berlese-Tullgren extractors. An increase in the abundance of soil fauna was observed from the dry to the rainy season, while the abundance of taxonomic groups was not modified. In both seasons, the most frequent groups were Formicidae and Collembola. Regarding the vertical distribution, the soil fauna preferred litter in the rainy and soil in the dry period. The microphagy and saprophagy represented the main forms of resource use, followed by predation, suggesting a sound structure of the habitat in the ecosystem. Moreover, the occurrence of groups that are found in undisturbed environments only, indicated that the ecosystem Restinga on the Island of Marambaia, at the time of evaluation (2002), was little or not degraded and well-conserved.

TI  - Salt marshes of the south of Santa Cruz, southern Patagonia, Argentina
T2  - INFORMES CIENTIFICOS Y TECNICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone of southern Patagonia, characterized by a macrotidal regime, allows the development of extensive salt marshes in estuaries and bays, which have been little studied. In order to characterize the marshes of the south of Santa Cruz, identify the main vegetal assemblages and analyze the variations of the vegetal biomass in relation to the tidal level and the time of the year, three samplings were carried out in spring (November 2015), summer (February 2016) and winter (August 2016) in San Julian Bay and the estuaries of the Santa Cruz, Coyle and Gallegos rivers. The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh. Spartina sp. was found only in the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, site that constitutes the southernmost record for this halophyte on the Argentina coast.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on spatial and temporal variations of total sulfur and inorganic sulfur fractions in sediments of salt marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on spatial and temporal variations of sulfur in marsh sediments, the levels of total sulfur (TS) and inorganic sulfur (IS) fractions (Water-Soluble-S, W-S-S; Adsorbed-S, A-S; HCl-Soluble-S, H-S-S; and HCl-Volatile-S, H-V-S) were determined in Cyperus compressus marsh (before invasion, BI), S. alterniflora-C. compressus marsh (during invasion, DI) and S. alterniflora marsh (after invasion, AI) in the Min River estuary (Southeast China) by space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the variations of sediment texture caused by S. alterniflora invasion showed great influences on the levels of TS and IS fractions in sediments at DI and AI stages. Compared with BI stage, the mean values of TS (g.kg(-1)) at AI and DI stages increased by 21.36% and 20.57%, while those of TIS (mg.kg(-1)) increased by 24.84% and 20.59%, respectively. Over all sampling seasons, significantly higher contents of W-S-S, A-S and H-S-S in sediments at AI or DI stages were observed compared to BI stage (p < 0.05). However, only the contents of H-V-S in sediments at DI and AI stage during summer or autumn were significantly higher than those at BI stage (p < 0.05). Moreover, compared with BI stage, the average stocks (g.m(-2)) of TS and TIS in sediments of all sampling seasons at AI and DI stages increased by 19.84%, 25.20% and 23.58%, 22.78%, whereas the values of W-S-S, A-S, H-S-S and H-V-S increased by 20.49%, 42.53%, 22.23%, 5.28% and 14.80%, 38.48%, 24.15%, 6.47%, respectively. These results implied that, compared to C. malaccensis, the increased S stocks in sediments might be an effective strategy for S. alterniflora to successfully invade C. malaccensis in the Min River estuary and the strong tolerance of S. alterniflora to high levels of sulfide might be more favorable for boosting its competitiveness.

TI  - Blue carbon as a natural climate solution
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

TI  - Effects of novel, non-native detritus on decomposition and invertebrate community assemblage
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - When non-native primary producers become successful, the structure and function of native detrital food webs can be fundamentally altered. Salt marsh estuaries of the southeastern USA are in part detritus-based ecosystems and rely on the annual production of detritus from a single native species, the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Over the last several decades, the success of a novel primary producer, the red macroalga Agarophyton vermiculophyllum (formerly Gracilaria vermiculophylla), in a system historically devoid of macroalgae provides the opportunity to measure the effect of non-native basal resources on native detrital pathways. We conducted 2 in situ experiments to compare (1) decomposition rates of A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora and (2) invertebrate colonization rates onto dead A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora. Relative to S. alterniflora, we found that A. vermiculophyllum decomposes more rapidly, losing 80% or more of its biomass within 3 wk, while S. alterniflora lost similar to 50%. Experimental litterbags with decomposed A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora harbored similar highly abundant invertebrate communities that differed greatly from denuded areas. Our results demonstrate that A. vermiculophyllum provides a complementary source of labile organic matter relative to S. alterniflora, boosting the amount of food and available habitat for small invertebrates of intertidal salt marshes and mudflats. Thus, non-native macrophytes may differentially affect community and ecosystem properties just as much when dead as alive, especially when they are biologically distinct from native species.

TI  - How do zooplankton respond to coastal wetland restoration? the case of newly created salt marsh lagoons in La Pletera (NE Catalonia)
T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We analysed the changes in the zooplankton composition in several new and old lagoons in La Pletera, a confined Mediterranean coastal salt marsh located in the Baix Ter wetlands (NE Iberian Peninsula) that was subjected to a restoration project (Life Pletera). We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.

TI  - Effect of the recent land use on the plant diversity and community structure of Omayed Biosphere Reserve, Egypt
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at describing and analysing the floristic composition and vegetation types, as well as determining the effect of recent land uses on the vegetation structure. It aims also at identifying the alien plants species and elucidating the impact of these species on the plant diversity and community structure of the study area. One hundred and ninety stands were selected monthly for this study, 145 species were recorded (69 perennials and 76 annuals) related to 83 genera, 40 families in 9 identified habitats in El-Omayed Biosphere Reserve (coastal sand dunes, salt marshes, saline depression, non-saline depression, inland ridges, inland plateau, irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands). Therophytes were the most represented life form. Three habitat groups resulted after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA as classification and ordination techniques: 2 represented the natural habitats and one represented the urban and cultivated habitats. Group I represented coastal dunes and salt marshes GII: saline depressions, non-saline depressions, inland plateau and inland ridges and GIII: irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands. Coastal dunes had the highest species richness (a-diversity), followed by cultivated lands, while inland plateau had the lowest; but saline depressions had the highest species turnover (beta-diversity). Non-saline depressions had the highest relative evenness, while saline depressions had the highest relative concentration of dominance. Coastal dunes had highest values of calcium carbonates and calcium ions, and salt marshes had the highest salinity, pH, potassium and sodium contents, but cultivated lands had the highest values of silt, clay and organic matter. The diagram resulting from CCA showed an influence of most soil variables, except nitrogen, calcium and potassium. Twenty two species were recorded for the first time in the study area. The recent land use (overgrazing, wood cutting and collecting, construction of summer resorts and irrigation canals and agricultures) led to the emergence of new invasive species, which may severely affect the plant diversity and community structure of this hot spot of biodiversity in Egypt.

TI  - Food Spectrum and Habitat-Specific Diets of Benthic Foraminifera From the Wadden Sea - A Fatty Acid Biomarker Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal coasts are characterized by natural disturbances, forming a broad variety of habitats, which provide different niches and varying food resources for benthic foraminifera. Foraminifera occupy different trophic levels and fill key trophic positions in benthic food webs, but detailed studies on their nutrition spectrum in inter- to supratidal environments are lacking. Further, it is unknown to what extent foraminifera can switch between different feeding modes depending on resource availability in different Wadden Sea habitats. In order to shed light on these questions, we investigated potential food resources in sediments as well as the food spectrum of two dominant benthic foraminifera, Trochammina inflate and Ammonia tepida, in four characteristic habitats of the Wadden Sea: salt marsh, mixed flat, oyster reef and mud flat, using fatty acid (FA) analysis. The sediments of the four habitats provide a broad range of food sources including green algae, brown algae, diatoms and bacteria for benthic foraminifera. The FA profile of T inflate from the salt marsh and mixed flat was dominated by green algae and bacteria, whereas the brown algae biomarker was only found in specimens from the salt marsh. In comparison, FA profiles of A. tepida suggested dominant algae feeding (green algae and diatoms), whereas brown algae and bacterial FAs were only found in specimens from the oyster reef. The results suggest that foraminifera mainly feed at low trophic levels with selective food intake closely depending on their habitat. The diverse nutritional strategies may allow efficient exploitation of resources in dynamic tidal habitats. Presumably, foraminifera serve as an important link between lower and higher trophic levels and thus fill key trophic positions in the benthic food web of the Wadden Sea.

TI  - Adaptation of benthic invertebrates to food sources along marine-terrestrial boundaries as indicated by carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent environmental changes and abiotic gradients of the Wadden Sea require appropriate adaptations of the local organisms and make it suitable for investigations on functional structure of macrozoobenthic communities from marine to terrestrial boundaries. To investigate community patterns and food use of the macrozoobenthos,a transect of 11 stations was sampled for species number, abundance and stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of macrozoobenthos and for stable isotope values of potential food resources. The transect was located in the back-barrier system of the island of Spiekeroog (southern North Sea, Germany). Our results show that surface and subsurface deposit feeders, such as Peringia ulvae and different oligochaete species, dominated the community, which was poor in species, while species present at the transect stations reached high abundance. The only exception was the upper salt marsh with low abundances but higher species richness because of the presence of specialized semi-terrestrial and terrestrial taxa. The macrozoobenthos relied predominantly on marine resources irrespective of the locality in the intertidal zone, although delta C-13 an values of the consumers decreased from -14.1 +/- 1.6% (tidal flats) to -21.5 +/- 2.4% (salt marsh). However, the ubiquitous polychaete Hediste diversicolor showed a delta N-15 enrichment of 2.8%(an increase of about one trophic level) from bare sediments to the first vegetated transect station, presumably due to switching from suspension or deposit feeding to predation on smaller invertebrates. Hence, we conclude that changes in feeding mode represent an important mechanism of adaptation to different Wadden Sea habitats.

TI  - Benthic metabolism and sulfur cycling along an inundation gradient in a tidal Spartina anglica salt marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Central aspects of carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry were studied along a transect extending from an unvegetated mudflat into a Spartina anglica salt marsh. Conditions along the transect differed with respect to tidal elevation, sediment characteristics, vegetation coverage, and benthic macrofauna abundance. Dark sediment O-2 uptake and CO2 emission at the highly bioturbated mudflat were low and relatively unaffected by tidal coverage. Sulfate reduction accounted for 30-60% of the daily CO2 emission from the open mudflat sediment. Sediment O-2 uptake within the nonbioturbated and vegetated marsh was up to seven times higher during air exposure than during inundation, whereas the difference in CO2 emissions always was less than a factor of 2. The contribution of sulfate reduction to CO2 production was low (<21%) and decreased progressively with tidal elevation as a result of the oxidizing capacity of S. anglica roots in the vegetated marsh. The boundary between the mudflat and the retreating marsh is a unique environment. High near-surface pore-water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) above the marsh cliff and highly elevated total carbon dioxide (TCO2) pore-water concentrations at both sides of the cliff during air exposure coincided with extremely high TCO2 emissions and apparent respiratory quotients (up to 14) only below the marsh cliff during inundation. We propose that substantial seepage of DOC-poor and HCO3--rich pore water may have occurred from the elevated marsh to the unvegetated sediment below during low tide followed by massive release of HCO3- during high tide. Accordingly, sulfate reduction accounted for more than the TCO2 release above the marsh cliff, but only for about 40% below the cliff. Mineralization rates and pathways in salt-marsh sediments vary considerably on small spatial and temporal scales and are dependent on inundation frequency as well as the composition and distribution of flora and fauna.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This "blue carbon" in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30°C) for 161 days. Q10 of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0  0.1 and 2.2  0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ  mol-1 and 58.8 kJ  mol-1 for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90  2.81 Gg C  yr-1 is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - The impact of ozone on a salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora plants were collected from salt marshes within New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia USA and shipped to The Pennsylvania State University. New plants were grown from rhizomes in six open-top field chambers. Three chambers received charcoal-filtered air, and three received charcoal-filtered air plus 80 ppb ozone, 8 h/day for 65 days. Flower, leaf, and shoot number per plant were recorded weekly. Photosynthetic rates were measured in week 5, and foliar injury was assessed during week 9. Final dry weight of roots, shoots, and rhizomes were determined. While ozone-treated plants from all states expressed symptoms of ozone injury, plants from South Carolina exhibited no effect of ozone on any other measured variable. Plants from the Georgia site showed ozone-induced reductions in all measured variables except leaf dry weight. Ozone-treated plants from New Jersey showed reductions in photosynthetic rate, leaf and shoot number, and root dry weights. Only plants from New Jersey produced flowers, with ozone treatment causing delay in flowering and reduction in the number of flower spikes produced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Contributions of ant mounds to soil carbon and nitrogen pools in a marsh wetland of Northeastern China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ant mounds often occur at high densities in marsh wetlands. However, little information is available regarding their impacts on soil nutrient pools in these ecosystems. We studied C-org, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in above-ground ant mounds and in soils under mounds for three ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida), and estimated their contribution to the total soil nutrient pools in a marsh wetland. Ant impacts were greatest in above-ground soils. All measured nutrient concentrations in above-ground mounds were significantly higher than the average values in reference soils (upper 25 cm). However, except for DOC, no significant differences for nutrient concentrations existed between soils under mounds and reference soils. The impacts of ant mounds on soil C and nutrient concentrations varied by ant species. L. niger above-ground mounds stored less C-org, TN and NO3- than F. candida and L. flavus mounds, or reference soils. At the ecosystem scale, soils in above-ground mounds and under ant mounds all contained less C-org per hectare than the reference soils. Total amounts in nutrient pools from mounds of the three ant species comprised from 5.3% to 7.6% of the total in natural marsh soils. More importantly, ant mounds increased the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient pools. Thus, ant mounds can be important to a fully integrated understanding of the structure and function of wetland nutrient cycles and balances. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Schoenoplectus americanus is a model organism for studying ecological and ecosystem responses of salt marsh plant communities to global climate change. Here we characterize 16 microsatellite loci in S. americanus to facilitate studies on the genetic basis of phenotypic responses to changing climate conditions such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. Most loci also amplified in the morphologically similar sister species, Schoenoplectus pungens. Five loci exhibited species-specific alleles or distinct allelic size distributions that discriminate S. americanus from S. pungens.

TI  - Discharge of dissolved black carbon from a fire-affected intertidal system
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report substantial tidal fluxes of dissolved black carbon (DBC) in a fire-affected marsh in the northern Gulf of Mexico. DBC was molecularly determined as benzenepolycarboxylic acids in a tidal creek, adjacent rivers, and the coastal ocean. Supported by stable carbon isotope and in situ fluorescence measurements, three sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were identified that mixed conservatively in the coastal system: groundwater from salt marshes, river water, and seawater. Groundwater was the main source of DBC to the creek. The highest DBC concentrations of up to 41 mu mol C L-1 (7.2% of DOC) were found in the creek at low tide, compared with < 18 mu mol C L-1 in all other samples. Over the studied tidal cycle, we determined a runoff (load per drainage area) of 3700 moles DBC (44 kg C) km(-2) of salt marsh. This is high compared with the Apalachicola River, where the annual DBC runoff is on the order of 10(4) mol (120 kg C) km(-2) yr(-1). In the marsh, it would require similar to 20 tidal cycles similar to the one that we studied to remove all black carbon produced during one fire event. Because a spring tide was studied, our estimate is as an upper limit. DBC is ubiquitous in the global ocean, and dissolution and subsequent lateral transport appear to be important removal mechanisms for soil black carbon. Our study, which provides a snapshot in time and space, demonstrates that tidal fluxes may be primary carriers of DBC, and therefore tidal pumping and groundwater discharge cannot be ignored in assessing the continental runoff of DBC.

TI  - Effects of coastal managed retreat on mercury biogeochemistry
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the impact of managed retreat on mercury (Hg) biogeochemistry at a site subject to diffuse contamination with Hg. We collected sediment cores from an area of land behind a dyke one year before and one year after it was intentionally breached. These sediments were compared to those of an adjacent mudflat and a salt marsh. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the sediment doubled after the dyke was breached due to the deposition of fresh sediment that had a smaller particle size, and higher pH. The concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) was 27% lower in the sediments after the dyke was breached. We conclude that coastal flooding during managed retreat of coastal flood defences at this site has not increased the risk of Hg methylation or bioavailability during the first year. As the sediment becomes vegetated, increased activity of Hg-methylating bacteria may accelerate Hg-methylation rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison study of sedimentary humic substances isolated from contrasting coastal marine environments by chemical and spectroscopic analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To gain a better understanding of the chemical structural composition and reactivity of sedimentary organic matter in coastal environments, the properties of sedimentary humic substances (HSs) isolated from contrasting coastal marine environments (i.e., salt marsh estuary, continental shelf, and continental slope) in China were investigated and compared. The complementary analytical approaches employed included elemental analysis, cross polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS)-C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and potentiometric titrations. The results indicate that HSs isolated from the salt marsh site in the Changjiang Estuary, which is strongly influenced by terrestrial river inputs, had the highest content of lignin-derived components, such as phenols and alkyl phenols, and acidic functional groups; HSs from the continental slope site in the South China Sea, which mainly originated from the inputs of marine algae and planktons, contained the highest level of aliphatic compounds, carbohydrates, and nitrogen-containing compounds; however, HSs from the continental shelf site in the East China Sea presented a mixture of both land and marine properties due to the influence of the two sources. Humic acids were found to contain comparatively more highly branched, long-chain aliphatic components but fewer oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxyl groups, and fewer sulfur-containing compounds than their fulvic acid counterparts. The total concentrations of proton binding sites and the structural characteristics of the studied HSs may provide insights into the migration and fate of HS-bound contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic pollutants, in coastal marine systems.

TI  - Variability of benthic assemblages in relation to the hydrological pattern in Mediterranean salt marshes (Emporda wetlands, NE Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and composition of benthic assemblages (organisms > 100 mu m) and the main factors which control them were studied in the coastal basins of the Emporda wetlands (NE Iberian Peninsula). Five coastal basins were sampled in three different conditions during one hydroperiod (1997-1998): (1) one month after the main autumnal inundation when the water level was high; (2) in the middle of the hydroperiod; and (3) when the basins were close to desiccation. Based on the hydrological pattern, three types of basins were distinguished: non-disturbed permanent waters (type 1), non-disturbed temporary waters (type 2), and disturbed temporary waters (type 3). These three types are in agreement with the classification result from the benthic assemblage composition. The type I basins, where more stable environmental conditions were found, had an assemblage characterised by a high density of individuals, total biomass and diversity. The assemblage of type 2 basins had lower richness and diversity values with little temporal variability. The high frequency of freshwater inputs in type 3 basins causes a high taxonomic singularity and high temporal variability of species richness and diversity. The main environmental parameters (salinity, sand percentage, total phosphorus from the sediment, and total organic carbon from the water) related to the structure of benthic assemblages, also discriminating three groups, were coincident with the three types derived from distinct hydrological patterns. Thus, water regime summarises the physical factors which ultimately determine benthic fauna.

AB  - Humic substances are considered to be a necessary component of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the most persistent part of the decomposing organic matter. In marine environments about 90% of the dissolved carbon, as well as a major part of the sedimentary organic carbon, is humic matter. In the salt marsh estuaries, in addition to the humic matter brought about by rivers, a predominant autochthonous vascular plant Spartina alternifora serves as a source of humic substances. Estuarine humic substances consist of C, N, and O, containing functional groups that can interact with inorganic elements and organic compounds. In this way humic substances apparently affect the bioavailability and toxicity of different pollutants. Although they could be used and structurally transformed by natural assemblages of microorganisms in some way, a considerable part of estuarine humic substances persist, apparently because of their adsorption on mineral components of estuarine sediments such as clay minerals. Due to their specific characteristics, including natural longevity in ecosystems, humic substances represent a natural factor apparently lowering ecological risk in salt marsh estuaries.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter examines the geochemistry of carbon and the nutrient elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon) in the sediments of estuaries and near-coastal seas. The emphasis is on the sources, storage, and transformations that occur in sediments during storage on decadal to centennial timescales. Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and phosphate are used to help differentiate sources and to help predict the effects of early diagenesis in the sediment stores. The principal sediment stores of C, N, P, and Si are muds and silts of shoal water or inner-shelf river deltas and non-deltaic, often estuarine, coasts. These stores comprise coastal mud banks (sub-tidal/intertidal), salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. The influence of human management of the coastal zone is reviewed, especially with respect to increasing sediment storage capacity, carbon burial, and greenhouse gas production.

TI  - Variations in sedimentary environments and accretionary patterns in estuarine marshes undergoing rapid submergence, Chesapeake Bay
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Major processes controlling sedimentological characteristics and accretionary rates and patterns were evaluated in two of the most common tidal marsh settings (estuarine tributaries and estuarine embayments) in Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest microtidal estuaries in the world. Textural analyses of 29 vibracores show spatial and temporal trends in grain size and organic matter which reflect differences in depositional settings within the marshes and changes in the controlling processes, as well as broader events in the surrounding watersheds. Spatially, the surficial sediments normally follow expected patterns, with coarsest sediments and lowest organic matter contents found in bay margin or channel margin locations, while the finest, organic-rich sediments occur in interior and submerged upland marshes. However, temporally, the marshes do not always show the expected increasing dominance of organic input over time (indicated by increasing % loss on ignition with decreasing depth), indicative of the marsh building process. Sea-level rise, tidal channel migrations, and anthropogenic effects likely contribute to decreases in organic matter contents in the upper sediment column. Furthermore, accretion rates and stratigraphic characteristics can be affected by these same processes, illustrating the importance of understanding temporal changes in marsh depositional environments over various time scales before sedimentologic and accretionary patterns are evaluated. Examination of the vibracores reveals that the marsh is composed of a complex stratigraphy with at least four major stratigraphic sequences occurring: (1) emerging or developing marsh sequences characteristic of channel margin and interior marshes; (2) submerging or mineral matter enriched marshes, also characteristic of channel and interior marsh areas; (3) high-energy marsh sequences characteristic of bay margin environments; and (4) submerged upland marsh sequences. The sedimentological properties of the stratigraphic sequences are controlled by overwash processes, tidal channel migrations, duration of tidal flooding, various anthropogenic effects, and sea-level rise. Accretion rates and patterns over the last similar to 200 years, determined from pollen histories, differ between the marshes along the estuarine tributary (Nanticoke River) and those found in the tidal embayment (Monie Bay). Marshes in the upper-estuarine tributary have a larger riverine sediment input, and trapping of the high sediment loads in the upper estuary often yields marsh accretion rates (maximum of 0.74 cm/yr) which are greater than relative sea-level rise (similar to 0.4 cm/yr), resulting in stable marshes. By comparison, estuarine processes limit penetration of high sediment loads to the lower reaches of marshes along the tributary and, as a consequence, accretion rates are generally lower than the rate of relative sea-level rise, and marsh loss is prevalent. Overall, accretion rates in the marshes in the embayment are close to or less than the local sea-level rise and do not have as distinctive spatial patterns as the tributary marshes. Although marsh loss has yet to be identified as a significant: process here, decreases in organic content of the upper sediment column may signal the early stages of submergence due to sea-level rise.

AB  - Plant preference and feeding selectivity were studied in juveniles of Nereis diversicolor O.F. Muller) and Nereis virens (Sars) (Polychaeta: Nereidae) to evaluate the potential role of these species in the integration and transfer of vegetal debris to the littoral ecosystem. Results show that these annelids ingest the main plant species (algae and halophytes) that are abundant in the marshes of the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France) and (or) the A l'Orignal Inlet (St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada), independently of their origin or level of decomposition. Juveniles select detritus on the sediment surface (feeding area) and accumulate them in their burrow. Constant irrigation by young individuals (approximate to 35% of time budget) maintains aerobic conditions favouring the decay process of plant debris by stimulating bacterial growth (gardening). Our results suggest that individuals of both N. diversicolor and N. virens play an important role in the transfer and integration processes and the residence time of vegetal detritus of the intertidal ecosystem.

TI  - Restoration objectives create surface carbon cycle trade-offs in coastal habitats
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coastal habitats are important and imperiled. To mitigate climate change impacts, carbon (C) sequestration has joined established restoration objectives, including habitat diversity, public access, and native vegetation. Changing topography, maintaining trails, and removing invasive plants may influence coastal C production and retention in different ways depending on how each activity influences the stabilization of organic matter in surface sediments. We quantified variation in litter and surface soil dynamics within and between coastal parks that varied in age from prerestoration to nearly 20 years old in Manatee County, Florida. Older parks had deeper soil organic horizons with higher levels of soil moisture and respiration, indicating that restoration sequesters soil C despite increases in microbial efficiency. However, variation within parks indicated that detrital C dynamics change depending on local management objectives. Relative to unmanaged locations, restored wetlands, including mangroves, salt marshes, and freshwater ponds, had soil organic horizons nearly 20 cm deeper, with high litter stabilization rates despite less litter mass and shorter projected soil sample C mineralization. In contrast, public access features like trails and kayak launches were associated with increased surface CO2 efflux and marginally reduced soil organic horizon depth. Removing invasives had little impact on detrital carbon pools and fluxes. Incorporating detrital C dynamics improved a multivariate model for variation in C pool sizes across sites. Overall, our results suggest that management objectives influence the C production and retention capacity of restored coastal habitats with restored uplands and public access points storing less C than relatively inaccessible wetlands.

TI  - Impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools sizes, stability, and turnover in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion may impact ecosystem structure and function, and further affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition. The results suggest that 10-year S. alterniflora invasion significantly alters soil organic C and N pools sizes and stability through changing plant residuals input, physical distribution of S. alterniflora-derived C and C turnover in SOM fractions.

TI  - Global environmental change and the nature of aboveground net primary productivity responses: insights from long-term experiments
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many global change drivers chronically alter resource availability in terrestrial ecosystems. Such resource alterations are known to affect aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the short term; however, it is unknown if patterns of response change through time. We examined the magnitude, direction, and pattern of ANPP responses to a wide range of global change drivers by compiling 73 datasets from long-term (> 5 years) experiments that varied by ecosystem type, length of manipulation, and the type of manipulation. Chronic resource alterations resulted in a significant change in ANPP irrespective of ecosystem type, the length of the experiment, and the resource manipulated. However, the pattern of ecosystem response over time varied with ecosystem type and manipulation length. Continuous directional responses were the most common pattern observed in herbaceous-dominated ecosystems. Continuous directional responses also were frequently observed in longer-term experiments (> 11 years) and were, in some cases, accompanied by large shifts in community composition. In contrast, stepped responses were common in forests and other ecosystems (salt marshes and dry valleys) and with nutrient manipulations. Our results suggest that the response of ANPP to chronic resource manipulations can be quite variable; however, responses persist once they occur, as few transient responses were observed. Shifts in plant community composition over time could be important determinants of patterns of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity, but comparative, long-term studies are required to understand how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to chronic resource alterations.

TI  - Influence of terrestrial inputs on continental shelf carbon dioxide
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The US South Atlantic Bight (SAB) is a low-latitude shallow continental shelf bordered landward by abundant salt marshes and rivers. Based on previously published data on sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and new dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) data, a model analysis is presented to identify and quantify the contributions of various terrestrial carbon inputs on SAB sea surface pCO(2). After removal of pCO(2) variations due to annual temperature variability and air-sea gas exchange from the in situ pCO(2), the temperature-and gas-exchange-corrected pCO(2) (TG-corrected pCO(2)) is derived. Contributions from rivers, salt marshes, and the continental shelf to the TG-corrected pCO(2) are then calculated. Our findings demonstrate that although additions of CO2 from within shelf waters (i.e., 1 pCO(2)(shelf)) were the greatest of the three components and underwent the largest seasonal changes, 1 pCO(2)(shelf) showed smaller onshore-offshore gradients than rivers and marshes. In contrast, CO2 contributions from river (1 pCO(2)(river)) and salt marsh (1 pCO(2)(marsh)) components were greatest closest to the coast and decreased with distance offshore. In addition, the magnitude of 1 pCO(2)(marsh) was about three-fold greater than 1 pCO(2)(river). Our findings also revealed that decomposition of terrestrial organic carbon was an important factor regulating the seasonal pattern of pCO(2) on the inner shelf. Despite large uncertainties, this study demonstrates the importance of terrestrial inputs, in particular those from coastal wetlands, on coastal ocean CO2 distributions.

TI  - Marine ecoregion and Deepwater Horizon oil spill affect recruitment and population structure of a salt marsh snail
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine species with planktonic larvae often have high spatial and temporal variation in recruitment that leads to subsequent variation in the ecology of benthic adults. Using a combination of published and unpublished data, we compared the population structure of the salt marsh snail, Littoraria irrorata, between the South Atlantic Bight and the Gulf Coast of the United States to infer geographic differences in recruitment and to test the hypothesis that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to widespread recruitment failure of L. irrorata in Louisiana in 2010. Size-frequency distributions in both ecoregions were bimodal, with troughs in the distributions consistent with a transition from sub-adults to adults at similar to 13 mm in shell length as reported in the literature; however, adult snails reached larger sizes in the Gulf Coast. The ratio of sub-adults to adults was 1.5-2 times greater in the South Atlantic Bight than the Gulf Coast, consistent with higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight. Higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight could contribute to higher snail densities and reduced adult growth in this region. The ratio of sub-adults to adults in Louisiana was lower in 2011 than in previous years, and began to recover in 2012-2014, consistent with widespread recruitment failure in 2010, when large expanses of spilled oil were present in coastal waters. Our results reveal an important difference in the ecology of a key salt marsh invertebrate between the two ecoregions, and also suggest that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have caused widespread recruitment failure in this species and perhaps others with similar planktonic larval stages.

TI  - Plant volatiles in extreme terrestrial and marine environments
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This review summarizes the current understanding on plant and algal volatile organic compound (VOC) production and emission in extreme environments, where temperature, water availability, salinity or other environmental factors pose stress on vegetation. Here, the extreme environments include terrestrial systems, such as arctic tundra, deserts, CO2 springs and wetlands, and marine systems such as sea ice, tidal rock pools and hypersaline environments, with mangroves and salt marshes at the land-sea interface. The emission potentials at fixed temperature and light level or actual emission rates for phototrophs in extreme environments are frequently higher than for organisms from less stressful environments. For example, plants from the arctic tundra appear to have higher emission potentials for isoprenoids than temperate species, and hypersaline marine habitats contribute to global dimethyl sulphide (DMS) emissions in significant amounts. DMS emissions are more widespread than previously considered, for example, in salt marshes and some desert plants. The reason for widespread VOC, especially isoprenoid, emissions from different extreme environments deserves further attention, as these compounds may have important roles in stress resistance and adaptation to extremes. Climate warming is likely to significantly increase VOC emissions from extreme environments both by direct effects on VOC production and volatility, and indirectly by altering the composition of the vegetation.

TI  - Morphological and photosynthetic physiological characteristics of Saussurea salsa in response to flooding in salt marshes of Xiao Sugan Lake, Gansu, China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The response of plant leaf functional traits to flooding in salt marshes is not only helpful in exploring the internal correlation between leaf plasticity mechanism and photosynthetic characteristics, but also of vital significance for gaining a better understanding on the stress resistance strategies of plants in salt marsh wetlands. The aim of this study is to investigate the responses of leaf functional traits of Saussurea salsa to flooding with the changes of water-logging durations.Methods The research site was located in provincial migratory bird nature reserve in Xiao Sugan Lake, Gansu Province, China (39.22 degrees-39.35 degrees N, 94.45 degrees-94.59 degrees E). A sample belt was selected from the edge of the lakeshore to the end of the perennial tidewater line in the low-lying area along the north side of Xiao Sugan River. The duration of water-logging in the salt marsh wetland was measured base on the water level marked by the flood rise and retreat marks in Xiao Sugan Lake over the years. The sample belt was divided into 3 plots according to the water-logging duration: low flooding area (water-logging duration: 30-90 days); medium flooding area (water-logging duration: 90-150 days); and deep flooding area (water-logging duration: 150-210 days). Six subplots (2 m x 2 m) of S. salsa were selected from each of the three plots for a total of 18 subplots. We investigated community characteristics and population traits of S. salsa, soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity (EC). Six plants per subplot were selected for photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Foliar samples collected from each of the six S. salsa were taken to the laboratory for measurements of leaf traits (leaf area, thickness, dry mass and chlorophyll content).Important findings The results showed that S. salsa changed the covariation strategy of S. salsa foliar morphology and photosynthesis with the extension of water-logging duration. In the low flooding area, S. salsa adopted fleshy lobular pattern with small specific leaf area (SLA), high effective quantum yield of photosynthetic system II (PSII) photochemistry in light (Y(II)) and low quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation (Y(NPQ)). However, S. salsa grew in the deep flooding area adopted completely opposite covariation strategy in foliar morphology and photosynthesis compared with those grew in the low flooding area. We observed a significant correlation between SLA and Y(II), photochemical quenching (QP), and Y(NPQ), as well as a significant positive correlation between the quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation (Y(NO)) and chlorophyll a content (C-a), chlorophyll b content (C-b) in all of the three plots. Under the influence of the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of still water in the flooded area of Xiao Sugan Lake, S. salsa population achieved the balance of the photosynthetic carbon budget by changing the morphological characteristics of leaves, such as leaf area, leaf thickness and SLA, timely adjusting the photosynthetic characteristics, such as Y(NPQ) and Y(II). Saussurea salsa showed strong tolerance to water and salt heterogeneity, reflecting the leaf plasticity and resistance mechanism of salt marsh wetland plant under extreme environments.

TI  - Phenological development stages variation versus mercury tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and sustainable management of rapidly mounting environmental issues has been the focus of current intensive research. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.

TI  - Sediment microbial activities and physic-chemistry as progress indicators of salt marsh restoration processes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Physicochemical (organic matter content, relative humidity, humic acid content, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content) and microbiological activities (extracellular enzymatic activities, basal and substrate induced respiration and bioenergetical parameters) were evaluated in salt marsh degraded sediments, during a 1 year revegetation trial starting at the end of the growing season. For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Significant but short time assimilation of organic matter from decomposed exotic Spartina alterniflora leaf litter by mangrove polychaetes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf litter is an important nutrient source for benthic communities within mangrove ecosystems and in adjacent areas. Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion to the eastern coastlines of China has been shown to alter trophic relationship of benthos in mangrove wetlands, but little is known about potential effect of exotic litter decomposition on food sources of benthic macrofauna. We took the advantage of significant differences in the delta C-13 values of exotic S. alterniflora (C-4 plant) from a native mangrove species Kandelia obovata (C-3 plant) to investigate leaf carbon assimilation by polychaetes during litter decomposition. We found that exotic S. alterniflora leaf litter decomposed more slowly than that of native mangrove species at the mangrove site (P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between them at the salt marsh site (P = 0.270). The polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from K. obvata and the particulate organic matter (> 90%) at the mangrove site. But the polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from S. alterniflora (> 60%) at the salt marsh site. However, after adding S. alterniflora leaf litter at the mangrove site, polychaetes assimilated more carbon from S. alterniflora (> 45%) than that from K. obovata (< 25%). Furthermore, the significant carbon assimilation only occurred within a short period time (1-2 months) during decomposition. Our results suggested that Spartina invasion can change food sources of local mangrove polychaetes through utilizing the organic matter released from litter decomposition, but such assimilation of exotic foods is of short time nature.

TI  - Pyritization: a palaeoenvironmental and redox proxy reevaluated
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrite as a proxy for the redox states of bottom waters was evaluated in the context of modern salt marsh sediments. Two sites, 40 m apart, with very different physicochemical properties were sampled seasonally. The sites differed from each other in (1) the amount of tidal flushing, (2) vegetation, (3) redox condition below the sediment-water interface, (4) carbon content and (5) solid phase iron oxyhydroxide and iron sulfide content of the sediment. The calculated degree of pyritization (DOP) varies between 0.44 and 1.0, depending on the site and the season. Different DOP values were obtained for the same samples when different techniques were applied for extraction of reactive iron. Framboidal pyrite was dominant; however, other textural forms of pyrite were also observed. The size distribution of the individual pyrite crystals and the framboids was fairly narrow; with the majority of them having diameters < 10 mum. Despite deposition taking place in aerobic waters (fully oxygenated waters) at the sampled sites, both the DOP and pyrite textures indicated dysoxic (waters with low oxygen concentrations) to euxinic (waters with no oxygen present, and H2S may be continually or intermittently present) bottom waters. These results indicate that caution must be applied when using DOP and pyrite morphologies as proxies for interpreting the redox conditions of different depositional environments.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration and Sediment Accretion in San Francisco Bay Tidal Wetlands
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands play an important role with respect to climate change because of both their sensitivity to sea-level rise and their ability to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Policy-based interest in carbon sequestration has increased recently, and wetland restoration projects have potential for carbon credits through soil carbon sequestration. We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using Cs-137 and Pb-210 downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0.2-0.5 cm year(-1), indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on Pb-210 dating was 79 g C m(-2) year(-1), with slightly higher rates based on Cs-137 dating. There was little difference in the sequestration rates among sites or across stations within sites, indicating that a single carbon sequestration rate could be used for crediting tidal wetland restoration projects within the Estuary.

TI  - Uptake and accumulation of metals in Spartina alterniflora salt marshes from a South American estuary
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are capable of reducing metal pollution in coastal waters, but this capacity is highly dependent on the metal, the physico-chemical characteristics of the sediment, the plant species, the production of biomass, the time of the year, etc. The aim of this study was to assess the uptake and accumulation of Pb, Ni, Cu and Zn in Spartina alterniflora from three salt marshes within the Bahia Blanca estuary (BBE), a human-impacted Argentinean system. Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora from the BBE is efficient in accumulating some metals, despite usually low metal concentrations in sediments and plants.

TI  - NUTRIENT AND METAL ACCUMULATION IN A FRESH-WATER TIDAL MARSH
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratigraphic records from sediment cores collected in a freshwater tidal marsh and in the estuary up stream and downstream from the marsh were used to determine the accumulation of nutrients and trace metals over long time periods. Analysis of pollen and seeds show that the high marsh has formed only within the past 100 yr, following increased sedimentation rates in the area. Variations in nutrient and trace metal accumulations over several decades show that pollutants from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge are stored to a greater extent in high-marsh than in low-marsh sediments. Greater accumulation rates in the high marsh are probably related to its greater sedimentary organic carbon concentration.

TI  - SULFIDE VARIATION IN THE PORE AND SURFACE WATERS OF ARTIFICIAL SALT-MARSH DITCHES AND A NATURAL TIDAL CREEK
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pore and surface water sulfide variation near artificial ditches and a natural creek are examined in salt marshes bordering the Indian River Lagoon in east-central Florida. Pore water sulfide concentrations ranged from 0-mu-g-at l-1 to 1,640-mu-g-at l-1. On average, the natural creek had the lowest sulfide concentrations (mean < 1.0-mu-g-at l-1) and the perimeter ditch of a managed salt marsh impoundment the highest (436.5-mu-g-at l-1). There was a trend of increasing sulfide concentration in the summer, and sharp peaks in late fall-early winter which correspond with peak litter input into the sediments. Significant differences in sulfide concentration between sites are attributed to differences in water flow and in organic matter content. Delaying the seasonal opening of culverts (which connect impounded marshes with the lagoon) until lagoon water levels rise in fall may prevent massive fish kills that have been associated with high sulfide levels in the impoundment perimeter ditches.

TI  - Coupling breakwalls with oyster restoration structures enhances living shoreline performance along energetic shorelines.
T2  - Ecological Engineering
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest and investment in constructing living shorelines rather than harder engineering structures are on the rise worldwide. However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions - wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of [approximately]1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability.

TI  - Sources, distribution and bioavailability of sedimentary phosphorus species in coastal areas off Changjiang Estuary
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Changjiang Estuary (CE), two transects along the Andong salt marsh (AD-A and AD-C) south-west of Hangzhou Bay, and three salt marshes on Zhoushan Island (ZS-A, ZS-B and ZS-C) were coastal zones receiving different flow regimes and human activities. In this study, sedimentary P species consisting of exchangeable P (Ex-P), iron P (Fe-P), authigenic P, detrital P (De-P) and organic P (OP) were determined in these sediments. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the degree of P pollution and the potential for these sediments to release P into the environment. Authigenic P was the largest fraction in AD-A, AD-C, CE, ZS-A and ZS-B (42-62%), followed by Ex-P (28-33%), Fe-P (4-19%), OP (2-8%) and De-P (1-2%); except in ZS-C where Ex-P was the most abundant (57.86%), followed by authigenic P (24.45%), Fe-P (12.34%), OP (2.85%) and De-P (2.49%). High portions of authigenic P indicate presence of apatite minerals; low levels of OP and De-P suggest low P pollution and low contribution from riverine input. The sedimentary total P (TP) in these locations (ranged from 91.30 to 324.74 mg/kg) indicates the risk of P pollution was very low. However, the bioavailable P (Ex-P, Fe-P and OP) constituted approximately 37-73% of TP. Thus, these locations are prone to release P from Ex-P fraction under oxic conditions and from Fe-P fraction under anoxic conditions.

TI  - Bromine biogeodynamics in the NE Atlantic: A perspective from natural wetlands of western Portugal
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bromine (Br) cycling in natural wetlands is highly complex, including abiotic/biotic processes and multiphase inorganic/organic Br-species. Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the western most fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br-) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8-75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3-13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8-13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1-8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br- rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111-253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br-] of interstitial waters (129 mu g/L-79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1-508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14-173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic "model". As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br- upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Importance of vascular plant and algal production to macro-invertebrate consumers in a southern California Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dietary importance of marsh vascular plants (primarily Salicornia virginica), algae and upland particulate inputs to macro-invertebrate consumers was studied in Carpinteria Salt Marsh, southern California, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. This marsh is predominantly a marine or hypersaline system and succulents are the most common vascular plant species. Of invertebrates collected from the vegetated marsh, tidal flats and channels, only detritivores from the vegetated marsh (Traskorchestia traskiana, Melampus olivaceus) had isotope values (delta(13)C= - 20 parts per thousand) that suggested some use of Salicornia-derived carbon. T. traskiana cultured in the laboratory on decomposing S. virginica or blue-green micro-algal mat had distinctive isotopic signatures, reflecting the capability of this consumer to assimilate carbon and nitrogen derived from these sources. The delta(13)C values (generally -16 parts per thousand 0 to -15 parts per thousand) of species from tidal flats and channels (e.g. Cerithidea californica, Protothaca staminea, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Neotrypaea califormiensis) were most similar to values for benthic algae and phytoplankton. Specimens of M. galloprovincialis along a gradient of presumed increase in marine influence had similar isotope values, suggesting little contribution to diet from upland runoff. The present results differ most noticeably from published values in the C-13 enrichment of suspension-feeders, suggesting the use of resuspended C-13-enriched benthic microalgae in tidal channels by these consumers, and in the C-13 depletion and N-15 enrichment of plants and consumers along a portion of the marsh boundary receiving inputs of nutrient-enriched perched groundwater. In general, the isotopic composition of macro-invertebrates indicated the incorporation of algal production rather than of S. virginica or upland sources into the marsh food web.

TI  - Effects of flooding frequencies on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in river marginal wetlands in a ten-year period
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland hydrology can greatly influence the variations in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils. The findings of this work provide a potential explanation for the "missing" carbon sinks at a larger scale.

TI  - Relationship between anthropogenic sewage discharge, marsh structure and bird assemblages in an SW Atlantic saltmarsh
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main effects of urbanization on coastal areas is through the discharge of sewage, which increases nutrient concentrations in the receiving environment. Salt marshes, like other coastal marine environments, are limited by nutrients, mainly nitrogen, and thus increasing nutrient loadings to a marsh may have consequences on marsh characteristics. We evaluated how the effects of nutrient enrichment in the form of sewage input, affected the vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh system near Bahia Blanca, Argentina (39 degrees 01' S - 56 degrees 25' W). Surveys of nutrient concentration, vegetation and birds were made at three different distances from the sewage discharge source. The concentration of ammonium, phosphate, and nitrate and the percent organic matter was higher in marshes nearest to the sewage discharge source. Bird composition and abundance, and vegetation physiognomy changed along a gradient of nutrient concentration. The increased habitat complexity found near the areas of higher nutrient concentration was exploited by birds that use neighboring interior and coastal habitats, including Spartina densiflora marshes, freshwater marshes and upland shrubby habitats. Our results show that local increases of nutrient inputs directly changed the vegetation physiognomy, and indirectly the composition and abundance of bird assemblages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Crab Burrowing Limits Surface Litter Accumulation in a Temperate Salt Marsh: Implications for Ecosystem Functioning and Connectivity
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Burial of aboveground plant litter by animals reduces the amount available for surface transport and places it into a different environment, affecting decomposition rates and fluxes of organic matter to adjacent ecosystems. Here we show that in a Southwestern Atlantic salt marsh the burrowing crab Neohelice granulata buries aboveground plant litter at rates (0.5-8 g m(-2) day(-1)) comparable to those of litter production (3 g m(-2) day(-1)). Buried litter has a low probability (0.6%) of returning to the marsh surface. The formation of burrow excavation mounds on the marsh surface is responsible for most litter burial, whereas litter trapped in burrows was an order of magnitude lower than rates of burial under excavation mounds. Crab exclusion markedly increased surface litter accumulation (3.5-fold in just 21 days). Tides with the potential to transport significant amounts of surface litter are infrequent; hence, most litter is buried before it can be transported elsewhere or decomposes on the surface. Crab litter burial can account for the observed low levels of surface litter accumulation in this ecosystem and likely drives organic matter transformation and export. The impacts of ecosystem engineering by this crab species are therefore substantial and comparable in magnitude to the large effects found for tropical crabs and other litter-burying organisms, such as anecic earthworms.

TI  - Grazing effects on microbial community composition, growth and nutrient cycling in salt marsh and sand dune grasslands
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of grazing by large herbivores on the microbial community and the ecosystem functions they provide are relatively unknown in grassland systems. In this study, the impact of grazing upon the size, composition and activity of the soil microbial community was measured in field experiments in two coastal ecosystems: one salt marsh and one sand dune grassland. Bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass were not systematically affected by grazing across ecosystems, although, within an ecosystem, differences could be detected. Fungal-to-bacterial ratio did not differ with grazing for either habitat. Redundancy analysis showed that soil moisture, bulk density and root biomass significantly explained the composition of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers, dominated by the distinction between the two grassland habitats, but where the grazing effect could also be resolved. PLFA markers for Gram-positive bacteria were more proportionally abundant in un-grazed, and markers for Gram-negative bacteria in grazed grasslands. Bacterial growth rate (leucine incorporation) was highest in un-grazed salt marsh but did not vary with grazing intensity in the sand dune grassland. We conclude that grazing consistently affects the composition of the soil microbial community in semi-natural grasslands but that its influence is small (7 % of the total variation in PLFA composition), compared with differences between grassland types (89 %). The relatively small effect of grazing translated to small effects on measurements of soil microbial functions, including N and C mineralisation. This study is an early step toward assessing consequences of land-use change for global nutrient cycles driven by the microbial community.

TI  - Direct and Indirect Effects of Tides on Ecosystem-Scale CO2 Exchange in a Brackish Tidal Marsh in Northern California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the direct and indirect influence of tides on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a temperate brackish tidal marsh. NEE displayed a tidally driven pattern with obvious characteristics at the multiday scale, with greater net CO2 uptake during spring tides than neap tides. Based on the relative mutual information between NEE and biophysical variables, this was driven by a combination of higher water table depth (WTD), cooler air temperature, and lower vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during spring tides relative to neap tides, as the fortnightly tidal cycle not only influenced water levels but also strongly modulated water and air temperature and VPD. Tides also influenced NEE at shorter timescales, with a reduction in nighttime fluxes during growing season spring tides when the higher of the two semidiurnal tides caused inundation at the site. WTD significantly influenced ecosystem respiration (R-eco), with lower R-eco during spring tides than neap tides. While WTD did not appear to affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GPP) directly, the impact of tides on temperature and VPD influenced GPP, with higher daily light-use efficiency and photosynthetic activity during spring tides than neap tides when temperature and VPD were lower. The strong direct and indirect influence of tides on NEE across the diel and multiday timescales has important implications for modeling NEE in tidal wetlands and can help inform the timing and frequency of chamber measurements as annual or seasonal net CO2 uptake may be underestimated if measurements are only taken during nonflooded periods.

AB  - The export of detritus and faunal biomass from mangroves has long been considered as an important support for offshore biological production and has been widely used as an argument for mangrove conservation. This functional role of the mangroves, like many other paradigms in mangrove ecology, has seldom been put to rigorous test since the hypothesis was postulated about 25 years ago. Past studies on which the hypothesis was based were mostly carried out in mangrove or other wetland environments, little is known about the fate and effects of outwelled detritus on oceanic, offshore, communities. Mass balance studies carried out in the last 15 years tend to suggest that export is common from tidal mangroves, the direction of flow depends, however, on the identity of the chemical species in question. Pore water and groundwater flow can affect tidal material exchange but are poorly studied. Generally, tracer methods using stable isotope ratios or other signatures have suggested that outwelling may be much less significant than expected. Further, most past studies have focussed on particulate matter while it is increasingly apparent that dissolved organics may play a more important role in matter exchange between offshore and mangrove communities. There is also evidence that benthic biomass and richness may not bear any positive or significant relationship with detritus availability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Examination of surface-associated protozoa in Great Lakes coastal marshes has been minimal, although they play crucial roles in nutrient and energy transfer in similar systems. Spatio-temporal patterns of artificial substrate-associated protist and bacterial abundances are related to physicochemical conditions at this ''freshwater estuary.'' Assemblages were sampled monthly (May-October) at upstream, downstream and at two mid-estuarine sites. A total of 278 protistan taxa were observed, and greatest richness occur red in late June. Richness at the estuary mouth was consistently higher than npstream, possibly due to the influence of Lake Erie assemblages and variability in hydrology-driven habitat characteristics. PCA yielded two components accounting for 90% of total variance in species by sites data. Species abundances at the two mid-estuarine sites were most highly correlated, and taxa seasonally abundant at any one site tended to be abundant at others. Presence/absence data were wed to calculate community similarity indices, and a permutation-computed test statistic compared the mean similarity of triplicate substrates in one month (at a given site) to the between-month similarity. Significant differences (alpha = 0.05) between some months (site by site) were observed with a unique assemblage noted in October. Following classification into six functional feeding groups, bactivores (mainly heterotrophic microflagellates) and primary producers (mainly cryptomonads and chlamydomonads) dominated assemblages. Organisms in other functional groups comprised only 10-15% of observed taxa. A preponderance of bactivorous taxa is consistent with observations of a dense and metabolically active bacterial community associated with abundant particulate organic matter in easily resuspended surficial sediments.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION BY HEAVY METALS AND FLUORIDE IN THE SAEFTINGE SALT MARSH THE NETHERLANDS AND ITS EFFECT ON SHEEP
T2  - Tijdschrift voor Diergeneeskunde
M3  - Article
AB  - The Saeftinge salt marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (southwestern part of the Netherlands) represents one of the very few tidal brackish marsh exosystems in Western Europe. From May 1983 to May 1985 the local pollution of this marsh with metals and fluoride was investigated. Samples from soil and vegetation were analysed monthly for cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, manganese, iron, and fluoride. The amount of these substances in the soil appeared to be related to both the percentage of clay  particles and organic matter in the soil and to the frequency of tidal submergences. In vegetation, the pollutants clearly showed a seasonal variation. Adherent clay, deposited on the plants during submergences, contributed considerably to the total amount of these elements. Sheep grazing in the marsh were investigated for renal and faecal excretion of these elements, but no relation between these samples and the seasonal variation in vegetation was found. Presumably sheep consumed vegetation selectively, avoiding the more contaminated plants. Regular clinical inspection of the sheep revealed no signs of acute or chronic intoxication. The organs of sheep that died during the investigation showed increased levels of cadmium in the liver and kidney, and iron in the liver, but not enough to cause alarm. Fluoride found in the rib material, although slightly increased, did not indicate fluorosis. In conclusion, contamination with metals and fluoride, as observed in the salt marsh,  apparently does not impair the health of locally grazing sheep. This may be due to selective consumption behaviour of the sheep, their stabling during the winter, limited biological availability of the elements studied, and a sheep management adapted to the local circumstances.

TI  - Potential effects of sea-level rise on plant productivity: species-specific responses in northeast Pacific tidal marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland plants are adapted to varying degrees of inundation. However, functional relationships between inundation and productivity are poorly characterized for most species. Determining species-specific tolerances to inundation is necessary to evaluate sea-level rise (SLR) effects on future marsh plant community composition, quantify organic matter inputs to marsh accretion, and inform predictive modeling of tidal wetland persistence. In 2 macrotidal estuaries in the northeast Pacific we grew 5 common species in experimental mesocosms across a gradient of tidal elevations to assess effects on growth. We also tested whether species abundance distributions along elevation gradients in adjacent marshes matched productivity profiles in the mesocosms. We found parabolic relationships between inundation and total plant biomass and shoot counts in Spartina foliosa and Bolboschoenus maritimus in California, USA, and in Carex lyngbyei in Oregon, USA, with maximum total plant biomass occurring at 38, 28, and 15% time submerged, respectively. However, biomass of Salicornia pacifica and Juncus balticus declined monotonically with increasing inundation. Inundation effects on the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass varied inconsistently among species. In comparisons of field distributions with mesocosm results, B. maritimus, C. lyngbyei and J. balticus were abundant in marshes at or above elevations corresponding with their maximum productivity; however, S. foliosa and S. pacifica were frequently abundant at lower elevations corresponding with sub-optimal productivity. Our findings show species-level differences in how marsh plant growth may respond to future SLR and highlight the sensitivity of high marsh species such as S. pacifica and J. balticus to increases in flooding.

TI  - Deciphering organic matter sources and ecological shifts in blue carbon ecosystems based on molecular fingerprinting
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) play an essential role in the global carbon cycle by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it as organic carbon (OC) in biomass and sediments. However, organic matter (OM) deposition and degradation/preservation processes are poorly understood, especially on the long-term and at molecular scales. We analysed sediment samples from six cores collected in tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses (up to 150 cm long cores spanning up to 10,000 yrs of OC accumulation) from Spencer Gulf (South Australia), by pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS), and we compared the results with elemental and stable isotope data, to decipher OM provenance and to assess degradation/preservation dynamics. The results showed that: (1) the major biopolymers preserved were polysaccharides, polyphenolic moieties (lignin and tannin) and polymethylenic moieties (e.g. cutin, suberin, chlorophyll) with smaller apportions of proteins and resins; (2) the OM originates predominantly from vascular plant materials (in particular lignocellulose) that have been well-preserved, even in some of the oldest sediments; (3) mangroves were found to be the most efficient OC sinks, partially explained by syringyl lignin preservation; (4) seagrasses were shown to store polysaccharide-enriched OM; (5) large proportions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) in surficial tidal marsh and mangrove sediments probably reflect pyrogenic OM from industrial combustion, and; (6) "ecosystem shifts", i.e. mangrove encroachment in tidal marsh and transition from seagrass to mangrove, were detected. Deposition environment and source vegetation control OC sequestration and there is no specific recalcitrant form of OM that is selectively preserved. For the first time, we demonstrate how analytical pyrolysis in combination with stable isotope analysis can be used to reconstruct (palaeo-)ecological shifts between different BCE. This study improves our knowledge on OC accumulation dynamics and the response of BCE to environmental change, which can inform the implementation of strategies for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Plant-Sediment Interactions in Salt Marshes - An Optode Imaging Study of O-2, pH, and CO2 Gradients in the Rhizosphere
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In many wetland plants, belowground transport of O-2 via aerenchyma tissue and subsequent O-2 loss across root surfaces generates small oxic root zones at depth in the rhizosphere with important consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling. This study demonstrates how roots of the intertidal salt-marsh plant Spartina anglica affect not only O-2, but also pH and CO2 dynamics, resulting in distinct gradients of O-2,O- pH, and CO2 in the rhizosphere. A novel planar optode system (VisiSens TDR (R), PreSens GmbH) was used for taking high-resolution 2D-images of the O-2, pH, and CO2 distribution around roots during alternating light-dark cycles. Belowground sediment oxygenation was detected in the immediate vicinity of the roots, resulting in oxic root zones with a 1.7 mm radius from the root surface. CO2 accumulated around the roots, reaching a concentration up to threefold higher than the background concentration, and generally affected a larger area within a radius of 12.6 mm from the root surface. This contributed to a lowering of pH by 0.6 units around the roots. The O-2, pH, and CO2 distribution was recorded on the same individual roots over diurnal light cycles in order to investigate the interlinkage between sediment oxygenation and CO2 and pH patterns. In the rhizosphere, oxic root zones showed higher oxygen concentrations during illumination of the aboveground biomass. In darkness, intraspecific differences were observed, where some plants maintained oxic root zones in darkness, while others did not. However, the temporal variation in sediment oxygenation was not reflected in the temporal variations of pH and CO2 around the roots, which were unaffected by changing light conditions at all times. This demonstrates that plant-mediated sediment oxygenation fueling microbial decomposition and chemical oxidation has limited impact on the dynamics of pH and CO2 in S. anglica rhizospheres, which may in turn be controlled by other processes such as root respiration and root exudation.

TI  - Nitrogen mineralization processes of soils from natural saline-alkalined wetlands, Xianghai National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen mineralization was evaluated using a 12-wk anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C in two wetland soils located in Xianghai National Nature Reserve, China. The Erbaifangzi wetland is an open wetland because it hydrologically connected to the surrounding ecosystem, whereas the Fulaowenpao wetland is a closed wetland, which is not hydrologically connected. Nitrogen mineralization was fitted to an effective cumulative temperature model. Nitrogen mineralization increased gradually with increases in the cumulative temperature and decreased with depth in the soil profile. Nitrogen mineralization was positively correlated with total N (TN) or soil organic matter (SOM), but not with soil pH. Basal N mineralization was found to be greater-in the Fulaowenpao wetland (0.314g N m(-2) d(-1)) than the Erbaifangzi wetland (0.230 g N m(-2) d(-1)).

TI  - Linking Anthropogenic Activities and Eutrophication in Estuaries: The Need of Reliable Indicators
T2  - EUTROPHICATION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND CONTROL
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In recent decades we have witnessed human-induced alterations to coastal watersheds that caused or aggravated eutrophication problems in estuarine systems. Although eutrophication is a natural process in the aging of lakes and estuaries, human activities are greatly accelerating this phenomenon by increasing the rate at which nutrients and organic substances enter aquatic ecosystems from their surrounding watersheds. Despite there is a fundamental understanding of the processes that cause eutrophication we still need to develop new methods and indicators and improve others to detect incipient eutrophication in ecosystems, providing information before major changes in species composition and abundance take place. The need of reliable indicators that correlate estuarine changes with human pressures over time (urban, industrial, and agriculture) is essential to understand their dynamics and to ensure effective management of these ecosystems. This chapter aims to evaluate the relative utility of rooted macrophytes and chemical variables in assessing eutrophication of two Portuguese estuaries subjected to different degrees of anthropogenic inputs owing to varied human activities and soil uses on their watersheds. We also document nitrogen deposition history in each estuary.

TI  - Organic matter sources and their use by bacteria in the sediments of the Altamaha estuary during high and low discharge periods
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the influence of river discharges on the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter (OM) in estuarine sediments, we conducted chemical and isotopic analyses of surface sediment samples collected from the Altamaha estuary (Georgia, USA) in March 2002 (high discharge period) and October 2002 (low discharge period). Chemical and isotopic analyses included bulk parameters (TOC, TN, delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15(TN)), chlorophyll-a (Ch1-a), lipids (fatty acids, alcohols, and sterols) and lipid carbon isotopic compositions. Bulk parameters were apportioned with a three-end-member mixing model and biomarkers were processed using principal component analysis (PCA). The modeling indicated that OM from C3 terrestrial and marine sources dominate (> 80%) at most sediment sites during the two periods while C4 salt marsh plants contribute a large fraction (similar to 40%) of OM at one site during the low discharge period. The PCA demonstrated that more allochthonous OM deposits in the high discharge period while more autochthonous OM accumulates in the low discharge period; OM in the high discharge period is relatively fresh while that in the low discharge period is highly degraded. Distributions of bacteria-specific fatty acids in the estuarine sediments followed the same patterns as Ch1-a, algal lipids, and mixed lipids but were not correlated with terrestrial lipids, suggesting that the microbial community in the sediments depends largely on OM from phytoplankton rather than from terrestrial higher plants. When salt marsh plants became an important input into the sediments, bacteria efficiently used this OM, indicated by the coincident changes between molecular isotope ratios of bacteria-specific fatty acids and bulk delta C-13(TOC).

TI  - Dynamics of bacterial community succession in a salt marsh chronosequence: evidences for temporal niche partitioning
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms underlying community assembly and promoting temporal succession are often overlooked in microbial ecology. Here, we studied an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence, spanning over a century of ecosystem development, to understand bacterial succession in soil. We used 16S rRNA gene-based quantitative PCR to determine bacterial abundance and multitag 454 pyrosequencing for community composition and diversity analyses. Despite 10-fold lower 16S rRNA gene abundances, the initial stages of soil development held higher phylogenetic diversities than the soil at late succession. Temporal variations in phylogenetic beta-diversity were greater at initial stages of soil development, possibly as a result of the great dynamism imposed by the daily influence of the tide, promoting high immigration rates. Allogenic succession of bacterial communities was mostly driven by shifts in the soil physical structure, as well as variations in pH and salinity, which collectively explained 84.5% of the variation concerning community assemblage. The community assembly data for each successional stage were integrated into a network co-occurrence analysis, revealing higher complexity at initial stages, coinciding with great dynamism in turnover and environmental variability. Contrary to a spatial niche-based perspective of bacterial community assembly, we suggest temporal niche partitioning as the dominant mechanism of assembly (promoting more phylotype co-occurrence) in the initial stages of succession, where continuous environmental change results in the existence of multiple niches over short periods of time.

TI  - Salt Tolerance in the Halophyte Suaeda maritima L. Dum.-the Effect of Oxygen Supply and Culture Medium on Growth
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda maritima is an annual species that grows in salt marshes and tolerates not only salt but also flooding, although plants are smaller at lower than at higher elevations of salt marshes. We investigated whether adventitious roots play a role in tolerance to flooding and how flooding affects ion accumulation in the shoots, a determinant of growth in this species. We examined the response of plants grown in Stout and Arnon culture solution to different periods of flooding at different salinities and verified our results with plants grown in other culture solutions (Hoagland and Yoshida). We measured growth, photosynthesis and estimated stomatal frequency as well as the accumulation of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+: plants grew and photosynthesised optimally in 200-mM Na+ (in Stout and Arnon solution), but the optimal concentration for growth increased to 450 mM when in Yoshida solution. Flooding always decreased growth, but had little effect on Na+ concentrations. Although plants produced adventitious roots, their mass decreased rather than increased with flooding. The decrease in production of adventitious roots under flooded conditions suggested that they were not important in the tolerance of this species to submergence-an unusual response compared with the general response of flooding-tolerant plants.

TI  - Effect of waterlogging on soil biochemical properties and organic matter quality in different salt marsh systems
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effects of hydroperiod on soil organic matter quality in three different salt marshes in the Baiona lagoon (N Italy) representing terrestrial, intertidal and subaqueous ecosystems in the area. The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.

TI  - Ecosystem-Scale Rates of Primary Production Within Wetland Habitats of the Northern San Francisco Estuary
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh restoration is hypothesized to provide shoreline stabilization, increased fish habitat, and organic carbon subsidies for estuarine food webs. Organic carbon comes from diverse primary producers that differ in carbon fixation rates and areal extent within wetland systems. This study was designed to obtain some of the first estimates of the relative contribution of different primary producers to total organic carbon production within open water and tidally flooded wetlands of the northern San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Carbon fixation rates of phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, and low marsh emergent vegetation were measured in two natural and four restoring wetlands in 2004. Areal (m(2)) rates of carbon fixation were greatest for low marsh vegetation, while phytoplankton and microphytobenthos rates were one and two orders of magnitude lower, respectively. However, when areal production rates were scaled to the amount of habitat available for each primary producer group, the relative importance of each group varied by location. Given that each primary producer group supports a different subset of estuarine consumers, the type of food subsidy desired should influence the amount open water channel, mudflat and low marsh area restored. Large-scale wetland restoration activities should consider the types of primary producers likely to occupy restored habitats when estimating future food web impacts.

TI  - Changes in benthic algal attributes during salt marsh restoration
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess attributes of algal assemblages as indicators of salt marsh restoration, we chose eight pairs of salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, each pair with one restored marsh (from I to 28 years old) and a nearby existing salt marsh. Algae on both Spartina alterniflora and sediments (sediment algae) were collected in each marsh during spring and summer 1998 for assaying algal biomass (dry mass (DM), ash free dry mass (AFDM), chl a content, algal biovolume), algal species composition and diversity, and gross primary production. An attribute restoration ratio was calculated by dividing attribute values from each restored marsh by values from a paired reference marsh. Controlling for regional variation in reference marshes substantially increased precision in relations between attributes and the increase in age of restored marshes. The organic matter restoration ratio of sediments increased with age of restored marshes in both spring and summer. The algal biomass restoration ratios of epiphytes, calculated with algal biovolume and chl a, increased with restored marsh age in summer but not during spring. Biomass of sediment algae was not related to marsh age. The species diversity of sediment algae in summer showed an asymptotic relationship with sediment nutrient concentration. The similarity of diatom species composition between paired restored and reference sites increased with age of restored marshes during spring and summer. Primary production by epiphytic and sediment algae in summer showed site-specific changes and did not change consistently with marsh age. Algal biomass, algal diversity, and diatom species composition during summer were positively correlated with sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. We concluded that other structural and functional development of restored wetlands, especially nutrient storage in sediments, regulates algal species composition and algal biomass accumulation, which can be used to evaluate salt marsh restoration.

TI  - ACCRETION RATES OF LOW INTERTIDAL SALT MARSHES IN THE PACIFIC-NORTHWEST
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-marsh accretion rate was investigated at sites that spanned a gradient in relative rate of sea-level rise in Washington and Oregon. Mean accretion rate over all sites was 3.6 mm yr-1 (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr-1), which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate (1.3 mm yr-1; sd = 0.6). However, a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr-1 (sd = 1.9) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate. Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate. Lowest accretion rates were recorded at sites with the least sediment supply. Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply. A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine predictions of the effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marshes.

Average foliar SRP release rates varied from undetectable to 7.5 mug P (g dry wt)-1 h-1 with values from individual plants as high as 61.7 mug P (g dry wt)-1 h-1. Release rates of SRP generally exhibited little diel variation and were highest in midsummer. Estimates of extrafoliar SRP accumulated on leaf surfaces varied from < 1 to 41 mug P (g dry wt leaf)-1 and 0.8 to 1.7 Mg p m-2 normalized to marsh area. Time course experiments revealed that SRP release was a 2-step process with a rapid solubilization of extrafoliar SRP and a constant release thereafter. Releases of SRP from creekbank stands of S. alterniflora during tidal submergence were estimated to be 3.1 to 8.2 Mg p M-2 d-1, with annual releases of 1.7 g P m-2 yr-1. Foliar releases of SRP from the live plants are equivalent to 60 % of the annual production of particulate phosphorus as S. alterniflora detritus reported from Georgia salt marshes.

TI  - The inner filter effects and their correction in fluorescence spectra of salt marsh humic matter
T2  - ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The inner filter effects in synchronous fluorescence spectra (Delta lambda = 60 nm) of sedimentary humic substances from a salt marsh were studied. Accordingly to their type and the influence of plant colonization, these humic substances have different spectral features and the inner filter effects act in a different manner. The fluorescence spectra of the humic substances from sediments with colonizing plants have a protein like band (lambda(exc) = 280 nm) which is strongly affected by primary and secondary inner filter effects. These effects were also observed for the bands situated at longer wavelengths, i.e., at lambda(exc) = 350 nm and lambda(ex) = 454 nm for the fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA), respectively. However, they are more important for the band at 280 nm, causing spectral distortions which can be clearly seen when the spectra of solutions 40 mg L-1 of different samples (Dissolved Organic Carbon - DOC similar to 20 mg L-1) are compared with and without correction of the inner filter effects. The importance of the spectral distortions caused by inner filter effects has been demonstrated in solutions containing a mixture of model compounds which represent the fluorophores detected in the spectra of sedimentary humic samples. The effectiveness of the mathematical correction of the inner filter effects in the spectra of those solutions and of solutions of sedimentary humic substances was studied. It was observed that inner filter effects in the sedimentary humic substances spectra can be mathematically corrected, allowing to obtain a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and humic substances concentration and preventing distortions at concentrations as high as 50 mg L-1 which otherwise would obscure the protein like band.

AB  - An 87-day simulation experiment was conducted to test the effects of water level fluctuation on soil properties of an inland salt marsh. The simulated wetland was periodically flooded for 15 days with consistent water levels of 10cm above the wetland surface soil and then drained to 0cm for 9 days. Soil samples were collected from the 0 to 30 cm depth with 10cm intervals at days of 0, 39 and 72 after a 15-day pre-incubation. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), soil organic matter (SOM) and pH were determined during the experimental period. Results showed that TN content was much higher in surface soils than other soil layers during the whole incubation period, especially at the second inundation period (54 days), and TN greatly increased in the soil layers above 20cm with increasing incubation time. However, the SOM content in each soil layer showed a consistent tendency of "decreasing followed increasing" with increasing incubation time. Compared to other soil layers, SOM content in surface soils were generally higher during the simulation periods. TP content in upper soils (0-20cm) consistently increased over the course of incubation time, while those in deeper soils (20-30cm) decreased. Soil pH values showed similar changing tendencies to SOM content over the incubation experiment, while they generally increased with depth. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill on Salt Marsh Periwinkles (Littoraria irrorata)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deepwater Horizon was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. waters, oiling large expanses of coastal wetland shorelines. We compared marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) density and shell length at salt marsh sites with heavy oiling to reference conditions similar to 16 months after oiling. We also compared periwinkle density and size among oiled sites with and without shoreline cleanup treatments. Densities of periwinkles were reduced by 80-90% at the oiled marsh edge and by 50% in the oiled marsh interior (similar to 9 m inland) compared to reference, with greatest numerical losses of periwinkles in the marsh interior, where densities were naturally higher. Shoreline cleanup further reduced adult snail density as well as snail size. Based on the size of adult periwinkles observed coupled with age and growth information, population recovery is projected to take several years once oiling and habitat conditions in affected areas are suitable to support normal periwinkle life-history functions. Where heavily oiled marshes have experienced accelerated erosion as a result of the spill, these habitat impacts would represent additional losses of periwinkles. Losses of marsh periwinkles would likely affect other ecosystem processes and attributes, including organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food chains, and multiple species that prey on periwinkles.

T2  - ADVANCES IN LIMNOLOGY 47: SUSPENDED PARTICULATE MATTER IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Suspended Particulate Matter in Rivers and Estuaries
CL  - REINBEK, GERMANY
AB  - The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Georgia rivers are significantly higher than the concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC). This dissolved organic matter (DOM) is shown to be composed mainly of DOC large than 10,000 dal, nominal molecular weight (NMW). The concentrations of this large molecular size fraction of the DOC appear to vary relative to river flow. Up to 25 % of the large molecular size carbon brought to the marshes by rivers form particulates when contacting the salinity gradients at the head of the estuaries. This newly formed POC has an enriched N/C ratio relative to riverine DOC. Concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are equal to or greater than inorganic nitrogen in these river systems indicating that DON may represent a significant source of nitrogen to heterotrophs in the estuaries. Annual flux of carbon as DOC and nitrogen as DON from the Georgia upland watersheds to the salt marsh estuaries is 23.6 +/- 3.5 thousands of tonnes C and 11.3 +/- 2.6 hundreds of tonnes N, respectively.

TI  - Salt-marsh areas as copper complexing ligand sources to estuarine and coastal systems
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved copper levels, copper complexing capacities and conditional stability constants have been determined in the Tagus estuarine waters and one of the saltmarshes located in this estuary, the Rosario saltmarsh. Tagus estuarine waters show a constant and around 20 nM copper concentration during the estuarine mixing. Most of this copper is organically complexed by a strong ligand (L-1) with a concentration that varies between 19 and 55 nM and a log K' between 14.14 and 15.75. In addition L-1/Cu ratios are quite constants and close to 1 all through the estuary, indicating the same source. A second and weaker ligand (L-2) was also detected in these waters in higher concentrations (36-368 nM) but with a lower log K' that varies between 12.06 and 13.13. The present work has demonstrated that salt-marsh areas are important and continuous sources of copper complexing ligands to the Tagus estuary. Noticeable, tidal induced transport continuously feed these waters with copper and ligands, mainly with the stronger one. This continuous input, together with the high residence times of this system results in a quite constant concentration along the salinity gradient. This input represents 95% of the ligand present in the estuary. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intensity of Respiration and Activity of Oxidizing-Reducing Soil Enzyme Depending on Their Agricultural Use
T2  - Russian Agricultural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientifically based fertilizer system used in the 11-field grain-grass-row crop rotation promotes an increase in the lethargic respiration rate in chernozem by 20.6-22.1% and catalase activity by 21.9-27.3% with very little activity of ferric reductase. On high rice checks of meadow chernozem soils, compared to low meadow-marsh soils, the intensity of respiration increases by 18.5-22.8%, catalase activity by 15.0-28.6%, and the activity of ferric reductase decreases 21.4-41.3%. Irrespective of the agricultural use of soils, biochemical processes are more active in the 0-20 cm layer. Permanent cultivation of rice for 80 years on meadow-chernozem soil leads to a decrease in the intensity of respiration and the activity of oxidation-reduction enzymes. The ratio of the activity of ferric reductase and catalase can serve as an indicator of the oxidation-reduction state of soils and, along with iron compounds, characterize the degree of their hydromorphicity.

TI  - Effects of non-native Spartina patens on plant and sediment organic matter carbon incorporation into the local invertebrate community
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cycling of organic matter through food webs is a fundamental process that may be altered by the invasion of non-indigenous plants. We explored consequences of the invasion of non-indigenous Spartina patens to the composition of soil organic matter (SOM) and to detritivore and herbivore diets in the upper salt marsh within Corrubedo National Park, northwest Spain. We tested for the incorporation of S. patens carbon (C) into SOM and by detritivores and herbivores using stable isotope analysis, focusing primarily on detritivorous enchytraeid oligochaetes and herbivorous insects. Stable isotope results indicated that C derived from S. patens has been incorporated into SOM. Elevated densities of enchytraeids in stands of S. patens, and their incorporation of C derived from this plant, suggested that dense patches of S. patens may facilitate detritivore populations. In contrast, although insect herbivores used S. patens as habitat, there was little isotopic evidence for the widespread incorporation of S. patens-derived C by these consumers. The population and dietary response of enchytraeids to S. patens suggests that S. patens invasion could indirectly influence soil processes and pathways mediated by detritivore activity (e. g., soil respiration rates, nutrient retention and transformation, energy flow). The loss of food resources to insect herbivores alters local food webs. However, insect herbivores may move and feed on native plants elsewhere. As a result, insect populations may be less immediately impacted than soil detritivore populations by S. patens. Our study suggests that the influences of S. patens invasion extend beyond the more obvious changes in native plant abundance, to include differing responses in the cycling of organic matter between detritivore and insect herbivore food web pathways.

TI  - Optical Characterization of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Fe(II) Concentrations in Soil Porewaters Along a Channel-Bank Transect in a Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were measured in surface and porewaters as a function of depth and distance from the channel in a transect up the bank in a southern California salt marsh. Higher absorbance coefficients and fluorescence intensities in porewaters at depth vs. surface waters and shallower porewaters suggest soil porewater is a reservoir of CDOM in the marsh. Higher values were observed at the marsh sites compared to the channel site, suggesting increased production and storage in the marsh sites, and reduced leaching into overlying surface waters, is occurring. Spectral slope ratios decreased with depth, consistent with more aromatic, higher molecular weight material in the deeper porewaters, possibly due to different bacterial processing in the anaerobic vs. aerobic zones. Fe(II) concentrations, indicative of anaerobic bacterial processing, increased significantly at depth to values >1000M, consistent with active anaerobic microbial processing occurring at depth. The transitions to higher reduced iron concentrations correlated with increased absorbance and fluorescence, suggesting processing by anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria in these deeper zones may not mineralize as much carbon as in the shallower aerobic zones. Alternatively, this may be due to reduction of solid iron oxides coated with organic matter releasing both DOM and Fe(II). The ratio of humic-like fluorescence to the absorption coefficient decreased with increasing iron concentration, possibly due to optical interference by iron species. Taken together, the data indicate that marsh sites in the salt marsh act as a reservoir for higher molecular weight, more aromatic organic matter.

CL  - MINNEAPOLIS, MN
AB  - The mobility and plant availability of many trace and toxic metals in wetland soils is often substantially different from upland soils. Oxidation-reduction (redox) and associated pH changes that occur in soils as a result of flooding or drainage can affect the retention and release of metals by clay minerals, organic matter, iron oxides, and, for coastal wetlands, sulfides. Except where a flooded soil or sediment becomes strongly acid upon drainage and oxidation, as sometimes occurs, the processes immobilizing metals tend to be complimentary such that large-scale metal releases from contaminated soils and sediments do not occur with changing redox conditions. Metals tend to be retained more strongly in wetland soils compared with upland soils.

TI  - Sulphide addition favours respiratory ammonification (DNRA) over complete denitrification and alters the active microbial community in salt marsh sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The balance between nitrate respiration pathways, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (DNRA), determines whether bioavailable nitrogen is removed as N-2 gas or recycled as ammonium. Saltwater intrusion and organic matter enrichment may increase sulphate reduction leading to sulphide accumulation. We investigated the effects of sulphide on the partitioning of NO3- between complete denitrification and DNRA and the microbial communities in salt marsh sediments. Complete denitrification significantly decreased with increasing sulphide, resulting in an increase in the contribution of DNRA to NO3- respiration. Alternative fates of NO3- became increasingly important at higher sulphide treatments, which could include N2O production and/or transport into intracellular vacuoles. Higher 16S transcript diversity was observed in the high sulphide treatment, with clear shifts in composition. Generally, low and no sulphide, coupled with high NO3-, favoured the activity of Campylobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Altermonadales, all of which include opportunistic denitrifiers. High n-ary sumation sulphide conditions promoted the activity of potential sulphide oxidizing nitrate reducers (Desulfobulbaceae, Acidiferrobacteraceae and Xanthomonadales) and sulphate reducers (Desulfomonadaceae, Desulfobacteraceae). Our study highlights the tight coupling between N and S cycling, and the implications of these dynamics on the fate of bioavailable N in coastal environments susceptible to intermittent saltwater inundation and organic matter enrichment.

TI  - Methanogenic abundance and changes in community structure along a rice soil chronosequence from east China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in abundance, community structure and activity of archaea were investigated for rice paddy soil under long-term cultivation along a chronosequence that spans 700 years in a coastal area of east China. Topsoil samples were analysed for archaeal abundance and community structures, which were determined with archaeal 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA genes. Methane production potential (MPP) was evaluated concurrently with a laboratory anaerobic incubation of treated topsoil samples. Gene abundance of archaea andmethanogenic archaea increased from 6.70 x 10(6) and 1.53 x 10(5) copies g(-1) in marsh to 2.89 x 10(8) and 2.73 x 10(7) copies g(-1) in rice soil cultivated for seven centuries, respectively. Compared with the uncultivated marsh, diversity indices for both archaea and methanogenic archaea increased markedly with rice cultivation. Methanogenic archaeal community structure was dominated by Methanosarcinales and changed to a lesser extent after 100 years. The measured MPP varied over a range from 241.3 to 301.1 mu g CH4 g(-1) for the rice soil, whereas it was 101.3 mu g CH4 g(-1) for the uncultivated marsh soil. Therefore, gene abundance of both archaea and methanogenic archaea appeared to increase with the accumulation of organic matter following long-term rice cultivation. The changes in MPP and community structure, however, were independent of differences in archaeal abundance. This suggests a complex interaction of soil organic matter, archaeal abundance and community structure, which could change the potential methanogenic activity in rice soil with long histories of rice cultivation.

TI  - Photosynthetic Responses to Light Intensity of Sarcocornia Taxa (Chenopodiaceae)
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes show a characteristic zonation of species distribution, which is correlated with marsh elevation. Radiation intensity and photoperiod change throughout the tidal frame. Photosynthetic response to light regime, 90-2450 mu mol/(m(2) s), was determined in the laboratory for four closely related halophytic taxa of the genus Sarcocornia (Chenopodiaceae), which inhabit different positions in the tidal frame. Sarcocornia fruticosa, which germinates below vegetation cover and is found at high levels in the tidal frame, had the lowest maximum net photosynthetic rate and stomata conductance values. The two S. perennis subspecies demonstrated intermediate maximum net photosynthetic rates but S. perennis ssp. alpini reached light saturation point at higher light intensities. S. perennis ssp. perennis, found in the lowest elevations of the marshes, spends a significant proportion of its time submerged and therefore needs to take full advantage of available light. S. perennis ssp. alpini is exposed to very high light intensities in open salt pans at high elevations. The hybrid, S. perennis x fruticosa, which is currently found at intermediate elevations with less frequent inundation, had the highest net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll a content. The ability to cope with high light levels may help to explain one of the environmental parameters, which affects distribution of four taxa throughout the tidal frame and also raise intriguing questions about the future role of the hybrid in the successive development of these marsh systems.

TI  - Marshes Are the New Beaches: Integrating Sediment Transport into Restoration Planning
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent coastal storms and associated recovery efforts have led to increased investment in nature-based coastal protection, including restoration of salt marshes and construction of living shorelines. In particular, many of these efforts focus on increasing vertical elevation through sediment nourishment, where sediment is removed from the tidal channel and placed on the marsh plain, or preventing lateral erosion through shoreline protection. In the USA alone, millions of dollars have been allocated or spent on these coastal protection solutions over the last few decades because of their perceived sustainability and ecologically positive co-benefits including habitat provision and carbon sequestration. These projects would benefit from integration of sediment transport pathways, budgets, and metrics during planning and modeling of restoration outcomes, in order to evaluate sustainability before investment. This is analogous to the decades of experience with coastal management and engineering on the open coast. Salt marshes are geomorphic features that rely partially on external sediment supply to maintain their network of tidal channels, intertidal flats, and marsh plain. Removing sediment from one component of the overall system to nourish another component may be counterproductive, given that the net sediment budget is unchanged. For example, dredging a tidal channel beyond its equilibrium condition will cause it to fill with sediment from the tidal flat or elsewhere in the system. This may cause slumping of the marsh edge, or over-deepening of other sections of the channel to compensate. Similarly, shoreline protection that prevents edge erosion hampers the marsh plain's ability to accrete on the levee and naturally transgress landward or it starves other components of the system of regularly supplied sediment. A limited vertical or lateral-only perspective, instead of a three-dimensional perspective, during project planning and evaluation may lead to suboptimal decision-making regarding restoration priorities, approaches, and outcomes. I contend that before significant investments are made in marsh restoration through sediment nourishment or shoreline protection, sediment transport measurements and models that consider sediment dynamics should be integrated into the early phases of restoration planning. This will help identify where and under what conditions marsh restoration will most likely be successful and economically justified. Triaging and prioritizing is then possible, which is a sustainable approach for restoration, given the persistent vulnerability of marshes to sea-level rise, storms, and sediment deficits.

AB  - Measurements of nitrogen, organic carbon and delta(13)C are presented for Spartina-dominated marsh sediments from a mineral marsh in SW Netherlands and from a peaty marsh in Massachusetts, U.S.A. delta(13)C Of organic carbon in the peaty marsh sediments is similar to that of Spartina material, whereas that in mineral marshes is depleted by 9-12 parts per thousand. It is argued that this depletion in delta(13)C of organic matter in marsh sediments is due to trapping of allochthonous organic matter which is depleted in C-13. The isotopic composition and concentration of organic carbon are used in a simple mass balance to constrain the amount of plant material accumulating in marsh sediments, i.e. in terms of the so-called net ecosystem production. Net ecosystem production (similar to 2-100 g C m(-2) year(-1)) is a small fraction (1-5%) of plant production (similar to 2000 g C m(-2) year(-1)). This small amount of plant material being preserved is nevertheless sufficient to support marsh-accretion rates similar to the rate of sea-level rise. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Classification and environmental correlates of tidal wetland vegetation in Nova Scotia, Canada
T2  - BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - We numerically classified tidal wetland vegetation and determined the relationships between variation in plant species composition and environmental factors. Sampling was conducted at eight sites along a range of tidal magnitudes (< 2 to >14 m). Cluster analysis revealed seven distinct salt or brackish marsh plant associations, usually dominated by a single graminoid species. Redundancy analysis showed continuous variation among community units and identified inundation time, elevation, soil salinity, and organic matter content as key correlates of plant community patterns. Associations detected were similar to those found in New Brunswick's Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait wetlands, and to those farther south in northern New England, but two new brackish associations were also identified within this study (Juncus balticus Willd. - Festuca rubra L. and Spartina pectinata Link). Although elevation is understood to drive vegetation types in salt marshes in the region, here we show that salinity can differentiate vegetation types at the same elevation. These data provide a quantitative baseline and allow for better predictions of tidal wetland ecological restoration trajectories in Nova Scotia.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh,emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater proportion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelagic and benthic aquatic consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources available in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had delta(13)C values of -29 to -21 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of about 8 parts per thousand, which indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had delta(13)C values of -23 to -15 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of 5 to 15 parts per thousand resembling a mixture of Spartina spp., benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic consumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources far the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced in the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, consumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where its availability is the highest. Third, benthic and pelagic organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are influenced by many factors related with human activity, such as eutrophication, chemical contamination, selective overfishing, bottom trawling and blast fishing. However, various regions have shown at least some changes that were likely to be attributable to recent climate change. Although various works have pointed to repercussions of climate change on ocean processes at physical and biological levels, a few thoughts were highlighted on contaminant pathways in concert with the predicted and confirmed climate changes. Human activities released during the last century a cocktail of contaminants that are stored in soil, coastal sediments and ice. Predicted alterations under climatic changes raise pertinent questions on this topic. Are hazardous substances stored in those compartments released to cycling within the ecosystem under climate changes? To what extent are quantities injected in the ecosystems toxic to marine organisms? Does it affect ecosystem functioning?This article reviews relevant aspects of contaminant cycling under climate changes and gives examples of evidences and scenarios. The selected examples are: melting of ice in the Arctic and the already observed increase of trace metals availability in water; temperature increase and the enhanced production of methyl mercury, a potent neurotoxin; prolonged periods of UV radiation and mercury release from soils and air-exposed sediments; sea-level rise and coastal erosion and the release of metals and organic pollutants from salt marshes; heavy rainfall events and abrupt input of historical and present contaminants from agriculture fields, obsolete industrial and urbanised areas.

TI  - Pollen-Derived Paleovegetation Reconstruction and Long-Term Carbon Accumulation at a Fen Site in the Attawapiskat River Watershed, Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) constitute a globally significant carbon pool; the paleoecological record provides an opportunity to investigate long-term drivers of change in carbon accumulation and related changes in vegetation. We present a Holocene record from the Victor Fen site (VM-3-3) in Ontario's HBL to reconstruct vegetation history, quantify rates of carbon accumulation, and determine the role of paleoclimatic drivers. Pollen analysis indicates initiation of peat accumulation over a mineral substrate, accompanied by relatively rapid rates of carbon accumulation, following emergence from the Tyrrell Sea similar to 6900 yrs BP. The earliest vegetation assemblage consisted of a tidal marsh, quickly succeeding to a Typha marsh, then a poor fen dominated by Sphagnum and Cyperaceae by 6400 yrs BE Rapid rates of isostatic uplift at the time likely contributed to these changes. Once established, this fen community persisted without major vegetation change until the most recent century, when the abundance of shrub and Cyperaceae pollen increased, suggesting increasingly minerotrophic conditions. Average rate of long-term carbon accumulation (LORCA) for the whole record (mean = 22.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is similar to other northern peatlands, and higher than the Holocene average for an adjacent bog. Increased precipitation after similar to 2400 yrs BP may have contributed to the higher LORCA reconstructed for the late Holocene, but the increased precipitation did not coincide with any apparent changes in vegetation as inferred from pollen assemblages.

TI  - Changes of community structure and abundance of methanogens in soils along a freshwater-brackish water gradient in subtropical estuarine marshes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane emissions from wetlands contribute to the currently rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

TI  - Salt marsh vegetation on the Croatian coast: plant communities and ecological characteristics
T2  - PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a lack of a comprehensive study of eastern Adriatic salt marsh vegetation with special attention to plant-soil relationships that determine individual plant assemblages. We surveyed 41 sites of salt marshes on the Croatian coastline in order to classify their vegetation by numerical methods and to compare the resulting groups in terms of soil chemical properties. A clear zonation between plant communities along the hydro-sequence was identified and was well represented by the dominance of individual diagnostic species. Two large vegetation groups were detected, well distinguished by mean species richness and soil properties. The first group, assigned into the classes Thero-Salicornietea and Sarcocornietea fruticosae, contains three subgroups of succulent, sparse stands of species-poor vegetation on the mudflat zone flooded by sea water, characterised by high salinity, electric conductivity, exchangeable Mg and K, and low nutrient content (total nitrogen, organic carbon) of the substrate. In the second group, tall rush communities (class Juncetea maritimi), three subordinate clusters, were identified, occurring in the upper, brackish zone with infrequent tides. Their soils had low salinity and electric conductivity and increased total nitrogen, organic carbon and exchangeable Mg and Ca. Vegetation within the second group occurring in the uppermost tidal zone had the highest species-richness, nutrient content in the soil and the lowest salinity. It has not been previously identified. Here, we described it as the new association Limonio narbonensis-Caricetum divisae.

TI  - Comparison of wetland structure and function on grazed and ungrazed salt marshes
T2  - Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophyte productivity, soil development, and benthic invertebrate communities were compared on grazed and ungrazed salt marshes to examine the effects of grazing by feral ponies on wetland structure and function. The marshes had similar geomorphology (embayment), elevation (streamside and backmarsh), tidal inundation (1 m), salinity (25-35 ppt), soil type (Carteret series), and plant species composition (Spartina alterniflora Loisel) but differed with respect to the presence or absence of ponies. Over a two year period, above and belowground (0-30 cm depth) biomass were significantly lower in the grazed marsh (aboveground = 196-400 g/m2, belowground = 828-1049 g/m2) than the ungrazed marsh (aboveground = 588-671 g/m2; belowground = 4,921-6,730 g/m2). Reduction in Spartina biomass at the grazed marsh resulted in less soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus than at the ungrazed marsh. There was no difference in C:N ratios at the two marshes, but N:P ratios were higher in the ungrazed marsh (9:1-19:1) than the grazed marsh (6:1-11:1), suggesting that more N is available for marsh organisms at the ungrazed site. Total benthic infauna density did not differ between the grazed (31,265 organisms/m2) and ungrazed (45,511 organisms/m2) marshes. However, the density of subsurface deposit feeders was significantly lower in the grazed marsh (10,370 organisms/m2) than in the ungrazed marsh (16,877 organisms/m2), perhaps as a result of lower soil organic matter and reduced food availability. Our findings suggested that herbivory by feral ponies co-ops primary productivity that would otherwise enter the detritus based salt marsh food web. This hypothesis should be tested using manipulative studies (e.g. exclosures) that exclude the ponies from areas of the marsh.

TI  - Short-term changes in simulated inundation frequency differentially affect inorganic nitrogen, nitrification, and denitrification in estuarine marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the possibility of short-term changes in hydrological patterns caused by climatic change, there is a need to assess the effects of inundation frequency on soil nitrogen cycling in estuarine wetland ecosystems. Here, we performed soil/plant translocation experiments in Shanyu tidal marsh, China, and examined the effects of elevated and reduced frequencies of inundation on nitrogen cycling over a period of 90 days. Our results indicated that soil ammonia levels (14.35-25.37 mg N kg(-1)) showed similar responses to changes in inundation frequency, whereas after 60 days of elevated inundation frequency, nitrate levels (0.32-1.52 mg N kg(-1)) were lower by 42.72% compared with the initial levels, although there were no significant changes in nitrate levels in response to reduced inundation frequency. After 90 days, both nitrification and denitrification rates were observed to correspond to naturally occurring hydrological gradients, showing increases of 564.49% and 108.82%, respectively, in response to elevated inundation frequency, and decreases of -77.83% and -94.92%, respectively, in response to reduced inundation frequency. Moisture, Fe(II), Fe(III), electrical conductivity, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants were identified prominent factor contributing to the observed changes in nitrification and denitrification. Our findings highlight the likelihood of changes in nitrification and denitrification in response to short-term elevation or reduction inundation frequency.

TI  - Coastal wetland loss, consequences, and challenges for restoration
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE COASTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal wetlands mainly include ecosystems of mangroves, coral reefs, salt marsh, and sea grass beds. As the buffer zone between land and sea, they are frequently threatened from both sides. The world coastal wetland lost more than 50% of its area in the 20th century, largely before their great value, such as wave attenuation, erosion control, biodiversity support, and carbon sequestration, was fully recognized. World wetland loss and degradation was accelerated in the last three decades, caused by both anthropogenic and natural factors, such as land reclamation, aquaculture, urbanization, harbor and navigation channel construction, decreased sediment input from the catchments, sea level rise, and erosion. Aquaculture is one of the key destinations of coastal wetland transformation. Profound consequences have been caused by coastal wetland loss, such as habitat loss for wild species, CO2 and N2O emission from land reclamation and aquaculture, and flooding. Great efforts have been made to restore coastal wetlands, but challenges remain due to lack of knowledge about interactions between vegetation and morphological dynamics. Compromise among the different functionalities remains a challenge during restoration of coastal wetlands, especially when faced with highly profitable coastal land use. To solve the problem, multi-disciplinary efforts are needed from physio-chemical-biological monitoring to modelling, designing, and restoring practices with site-specific knowledge.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate applicability of the end-member mixing model in assessment of input and transport of organic carbon in estuarine systems, we incubated marine diatom, land grass, and salt marsh plant in Altamaha estuarine water for two months. Chemical and isotopic parameters (bulk organic carbon/nitrogen contents, lipid compositions, stable C/N isotopes, and lipid stable carbon isotopic ratios) were analyzed for fresh and degraded materials. The results showed that although the C/N and delta N-15 ratios of three materials varied similarly during degradation, the bulk delta C-13, lipid compositions, and lipid stable carbon isotopic compositions varied differently from material to material and from compound to compound, implying that applications of the end-member model should consider the diagenetic status of organic materials and the potential changes in chemical and isotopic signatures.

T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying living roots in a marsh is a necessary but difficult task in wetland research. The two main difficulties usually encountered are distinguishing living from dead roots and processing a dense mat of fine roots. We found that living roots of salt-marsh plants release much more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in boiling water than dead roots. Based on this finding, we developed a DOC procedure to quantify living roots of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus. The DOC released in boiling water is a function of root activity, and the amount released can be used to calculate the living root biomass of a sample. The amount of living roots determined by the DOC method correlated well with the amount of living roots determined by the manual sorting method (r2 = 0.78, p < 0.01). The DOC method is more objective, precise, and much less tedious than the manual sorting method.

TI  - Regulation of climate, soil and hydrological factors on macrophyte biomass allocation for coastal and inland wetlands in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of root: shoot ratio (R/S) is fundamental for our understanding of carbon allocation and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the periodic variation of water table and the difficulty ofmeasuring belowground biomass (BGB), macrophyte biomass allocation in both coastal and inland wetlands remains unclear, especially at regional scale. In this study, 131 records of biomass allocation inwetlandswere collected to examine general pattern of macrophyte R/S in relation to climate, soil, and hydrological factors in China using model selection and variance decomposition analysis. Our results showed that coastal wetlands supported higher aboveground biomass (AGB, 3.1 kgm(-2)) but a lower R/S (1.2) than inland ones (1.47 kgm(-2) and 3.1, respectively). The positive relationships between AGB and BGB and between BGB and R/S in coastal wetlands were significantly different from those in inland wetlands, while only inland wetlands exhibited a significant negative correlation between R/S and AGB (R-2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Among climate ( i.e., mean annual temperature and precipitation), soil (e.g., pH, salinity, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), and hydrological (water level and depth for coastal and inland wetlands, respectively) properties, the latter two groups explained 64% and 31% of spatial variation for inland and coastal R/S, respectively, compared with climate (2.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Specifically, soil salinity was the most important factor in regulating R/S for coastal wetlands, while, for inlandwetlands, itwas soil phosphorus. This study highlights the importance of hydrology, soil salinity and nutrients on wetland R/S and BGB estimation, which could be incorporated into wetland ecosystem models to improve prediction performance for carbon dynamics and their feedbacks to climate change in the future.

TI  - Habitat range and phenotypic variation in salt marsh plants
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecologists have long speculated that species with wider environmental ranges would have broader ranges in phenotype; however, most tests of this hypothesis have involved small numbers of species and/or closely related taxa. We related phenotypic variation in twelve salt marsh plant species from six families to variation in four environmental variables using multiple regression. Within species, plant phenotype was predictably related to environmental variation. Salinity was the most common predictor of plant traits, followed by organic content, water content and elevation. Across species, regressions of single plant trait CVs on range (2 X SD) of single environmental variables were not significant and did not support the hypothesis that species occupying broad environmental ranges would have broad ranges in phenotypes. However, regression of a composite phenotypic PCAI on a composite environmental PCAI showed a marginally significant (P = 0.054) linear relationship for 10 species. Considering the different patterns of response across species, the lack of a relationship between variation in single phenotypic traits and single environmental variables is likely because the distantly-related taxa employed fundamentally different morphological and physiological strategies to respond to environmental stress gradients. The significant relationship between composite environmental and phenotypic variables reflects the complex nature of species phenotypic response to multivariate environmental gradients. Specifically, in this system, species increase variation in the number of leaves, but decrease variation in leaf size in response to an increase in range of salinity and decrease in range of water and organic content.

TI  - The blue carbon wealth of nations
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows is an essential coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystem service for climate change mitigation. Here we offer a comprehensive, global and spatially explicit economic assessment of carbon sequestration and storage in three coastal ecosystem types at the global and national levels. We propose a new approach based on the country-specific social cost of carbon that allows us to calculate each country's contribution to, and redistribution of, global blue carbon wealth. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute a mean +/- s.e.m. of US$190.67 +/- 30 bn yr(-1) to blue carbon wealth. The three countries generating the largest positive net blue wealth contribution for other countries are Australia, Indonesia and Cuba, with Australia alone generating a positive net benefit of US$22.8 +/- 3.8 bn yr(-)(1) for the rest of the world through coastal ecosystem carbon sequestration and storage in its territory.Blue carbon ecosystems take up and store substantial amounts of carbon. This represents an important ecosystem service in the context of climate change, with coastal ecosystems contributing nearly US$200 bn yr(-)(1) to blue carbon wealth.

TI  - The significance of spatial and temporal patterns of algal mat deposition in structuring salt marsh vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Question: Are there hot spots of algal mat deposition in space and time at the marsh scale and, if so, how does this affect the coexistence of a dominant (Spartina anglica) and gap dependent (Salicornia europaea) species?Location: The Rattekaai salt marsh in the Scheldt estuary in the southwestern Netherlands (NW Europe).Methods: Mat cover and the abundance of the gap dependent species Salicornia europaea were monitored at the scale of a marsh. The effects of mat cover on the vegetation structure were studied by applying three mat removal treatments over three growing seasons.Results: The low marsh border was found to be a hot spot of algal mat deposition during the growing season, which had a correlated spatial pattern between two successive years at a 20 in x 20 in scale. The combination of duration, timing and repetition of mat cover determined growth inhibition of the competitive dominant Spartina anglica, and thereby the abundance of subordinates such as Salicornia europaea. Mat cover reduced the storage of carbon reserves in Spartina and our results imply that repetition of non-lethal mat cover can lead to,gap creation'. Gaps gave only temporary habitat to less dominant species since Spartina quickly re-invaded them. The gap dependent annual Salicornia was most abundant at intermediate levels, of disturbance measured as a function of both space and time.Conclusions: In addition to disturbance level, the spatial and temporal distribution of disturbance are important in creating and maintaining habitat for gap dependent species. Relatively small disturbances will have a large effect on diversity if the spatial and temporal distribution of the disturbances leads to 'disturbance hot spots'.

TI  - A closed chamber CO2 flux method for estimating marsh productivity
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a closed-chamber method of rapidly measuring CO2 flux in marshes which, in conjunction with appropriate sampling strategies, can be useful for estimating marsh net productivity, comparing productivity of two or more marshes, or assessing factors that influence productivity. The method relies on placement of an environmental chamber over the marsh followed by no more than 6 min of measurement via an infrared gas analyzer. Three laboratory trials and one field trial were undertaken to assess the method. Laboratory trials included: (1) ensuring that measurements could show a well-defined relationship between CO2 concentration and CO2 flux, (2) regression of CO2 flux measurements against biomass for Sporobolus virginicus (L.) Kunth, and (3) comparison of CO2 flux for three plant species associated with salt marshes to ensure that the method could detect differences among species. The field trial compared pairs of CO2 flux measurements from 14 plots to assess precision. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in photosynthetic yield (Fv/Fm) responses of salt-marsh microalgal communities along an osmotic gradient (Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, France)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of salt-marsh microphytobenthic communities to daily changes is characterized by high microalgal growth rates. In comparison, the irregular tidal submersions that prevail in the extreme macrotidal system of "La Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel" (France) could be considered as a large-scale disturbance. The physiological capacities of microphytobenthic communities along a salinity gradient were assessed for rapid response to osmotic stress, salinity tolerance and changes in response to short-time submersion. The photosynthetic system response (Fv/Fm) of microphytobenthic communities sampled at different levels of the saltmarsh along a conductivity gradient was studied during spring-tide and neap-tide periods. All samples demonstrated a dominant adaptation of the microalgal community to coastal seawater salinity, but response heterogeneity ruled out euryhaline adaptation as the global response of microphytobenthic taxa. The higher and lower salinity tolerances at the seaward and uppermost stations, respectively, were probably due to the occurrence of oversalted or undersalted habitats during the neap tide period. Moreover, the seaward communities were characterized by successive stimulation and inhibition of Fv/Fm during the spring tide period. Such a phenomenon could result from the opposing influences of sea submersion, which supplies resources on the one hand and destabilizes the biofilm on the other hand. Despite the singular response of these saltmarsh microphytobenthic communities to a conductivity gradient, the rapid and irregular salinity changes due to seawater submersion cannot be considered as a stressor for the dominant taxa.

TI  - Predicting dissolved organic carbon concentration in a dynamic salt marsh creek via machine learning
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a master variable in aquatic systems. Resolving DOC dynamics requires high-temporal resolution data. However, DOC concentration cannot be directly measured in situ, and discrete sample collection and analysis becomes expensive as temporal resolution increases. To surmount this problem, an option is to predict site-specific DOC concentration with linear modeling and optical data predictors collected from high-cost, high-maintenance in situ spectrophotometers. This study sought to improve upon the accuracy and field costs of linear predictive DOC methods by using machine learning modeling coupled to low-to-zero cost predictors. To do this, we collected 16 months of in situ data (e.g., spectrophotometer attenuation, salinity, temperature), assembled freely available predictors (e.g., point in year, rainfall), and collected samples for DOC analysis, all in a salt marsh creek. At seasonal timescales, machine learning (coefficient of determination [R-2] = 0.90) modestly improved upon the accuracy of linear methods (R-2 = 0.80) but offered substantial instrumentation cost reductions (similar to 90%) by requiring only cost-free predictors (online data) or cost-free predictors paired with low-cost in situ predictors (temperature, salinity, depth). At intertidal timescales, linear methods proved ill-equipped to predict DOC concentration compared to machine learning, and again, machine learning offered a substantial instrumentation cost reduction (similar to 90%). Although our models were developed for and applicable to a single site, the use of machine learning with low-to-zero cost predictors provides a blueprint for others trying to model DOC dynamics and other analytes in any complex aquatic system.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil exposure has been shown to be detrimental to several salt marsh plants however little information is available for Juncus roemerianus. Thirty-two mesocosms were established with J. roemerianus sod and replicate marshes were exposed to Louisiana sweet crude oil to test oil dose (6, 12, and 24 L m(-2)) and weathering (oil weathered for 0 days, 3 days, and 3 weeks). Juncus were monitored following oil exposure for culm survival, photosynthetic rates, and C-assimilation rates. Oil dosage had a significant effect among wetlands with low-dose (6 L m(-2)) mesocosms having higher culm survival, photosynthetic rates, and C-assimilation rates than medium or high dose wetlands (12 or 24 L m(-2)). Oil weathering did not elicit significant differences between treated wetlands however full strength wetlands (un-weathered oil) consistently had the lowest culm survivorship, photosynthetic rates, and C-assimilation rates. From our results, J. roemerianus marshes may be very susceptible to oil exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trophic subsidies of Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus edulis and Crepidula fornicata in the Bay of Mont Saint Michel (France): A delta C-13 and delta N-15 investigation
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focussed on the determination of the main trophic subsidies for three dominant filter feeding molluscs of the benthic community, namely, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), Mytilus edulis (L.) and Crepidula fornicata (L.), cultivated or naturally occurring in the Bay of Mont Michel (France). delta C-13 and delta N-15 values revealed that the diet of these filter feeders was primarily based on marine plankton together with a lower contribution of the organic matter derived from salt marsh phanerogames, as estimated through the isotopic mixing equations (Isosource). The microphytobenthos inhabiting the intertidal flat and the salt marshes do not contribute significantly to the diet of cultivated and naturally occurring C. gigas and M. edulis. Hence, in this bay, the major trophic pathways differ from previous results obtained in several coastal systems devoted to shellfish culture. This could result from ecological particularities and/or strong hydrodynamic conditions in the Bay of Mont Michel. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These are consistent with findings from seasonally sampled modern silts, and with the interpretation, on physical and palynological grounds, of the fine-grained and coarse-grained components as warm-season and cold-season deposits, respectively. The control is considered to be seasonal variations in the character of the organic matter supplied.

TI  - Responses of Spartina alterniflora to Multiple Stressors: Changing Precipitation Patterns, Accelerated Sea Level Rise, and Nutrient Enrichment
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands, well recognized for their ecosystem services, have faced many threats throughout the USA and elsewhere. While managers require good information on the net impact of these combined stressors on wetlands, little such information exists. We conducted a 4-month mesocosm study to analyze the multiple stressor effects of precipitation changes, sea level rise, and eutrophication on the salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora. Pots containing plants in an organic soil matrix were positioned in tanks and received Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) water. The study simulated three precipitation levels (ambient daily rain, biweekly storm, and drought), three levels of tidal inundations (high (15 cm below mean high water (MHW)), mean (MHW), and low (15 cm above MHW)), and two nutrient enrichment levels (unenriched and nutrient-enriched bay water). Our results demonstrate that storm and drought stressors led to significantly less above- and belowground biomass than those in ambient rain conditions. Plants that were flooded at high inundation had less belowground biomass, fine roots, and shoots. Nutrients had no detectable effect on aboveground biomass, but the enriched pots had higher stem counts and more fine roots than unenriched pots, in addition to greater CO2 emission rates; however, the unenriched pots had significantly more coarse roots and rhizomes, which help to build peat in organogenic marshes. These results suggest that multiple stressors of altered precipitation, sea level rise, and nutrient enrichment would lead to reduced marsh sustainability.

TI  - Saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes alters the biogeochemical processing of organic carbon
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental perturbations in wetlands affect the integrated plant-microbial-soil system, causing biogeochemical responses that can manifest at local to global scales. The objective of this study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas production in coastal wetlands. Working with tidal freshwater marsh soils that had experienced similar to 3.5 yr of in situ saltwater additions, we quantified changes in soil properties, measured extracellular enzyme activity associated with organic matter breakdown, and determined potential rates of anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production. Soils from the field plots treated with brackish water had lower carbon content and higher C : N ratios than soils from freshwater plots, indicating that saltwater intrusion reduced carbon availability and increased organic matter recalcitrance. This was reflected in reduced activities of enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of cellulose and the oxidation of lignin, leading to reduced rates of soil CO2 and CH4 production. The effects of long-term saltwater additions contrasted with the effects of short-term exposure to brackish water during three-day laboratory incubations, which increased rates of CO2 production but lowered rates of CH4 production. Collectively, our data suggest that the long-term effect of saltwater intrusion on soil CO2 production is indirect, mediated through the effects of elevated salinity on the quantity and quality of autochthonous organic matter inputs to the soil. In contrast, salinity, organic matter content, and enzyme activities directly influence CH4 production. Our analyses demonstrate that saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes affects the entire process of carbon mineralization, from the availability of organic carbon through its terminal metabolism to CO2 and/or CH4, and illustrate that long-term shifts in biogeochemical functioning are not necessarily consistent with short-term disturbance-type responses.

TI  - What drives the distribution of crab burrows in different habitats of intertidal salt marshes, Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crabs play important roles in coastal ecosystems and are useful indicators for evaluating ecosystem health. Many previous studies have examined the distribution patterns of crabs among different habitats. However, we know little about what the key factors determining crab burrow distribution among types of habitats. Different kind of crab species may have different preferences of environmental conditions, here, we focus on the dominant crab species Hate tientsinensis in the Yellow River Delta. To identify the drivers of crab burrow distribution in intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta, we examined crab burrow density among seven habitats across different marsh zones, with reference to abiotic (water depth, soil hardness, water content, bulk density, porewater salinity, organic matter, total nitrogen and total carbon) and biotic (plant coverage, above- and belowground biomass, macrofauna species richness, abundance and biomass) factors that might explain crab burrow distribution patterns. Differences of all above factors were examined by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) among different habitats. The best single predictors of crab burrow density were tested by liner re- gression across the entire study area. Our results showed that patterns of crab burrow distribution were more strongly affected by abiotic drivers (water depth, water content, salinity, soil hardness, organic matter and total carbon) than biotic drivers. Crabs prefer habitats with softer and wetter edaphic conditions. In the future of coastal management, building habitats first, thereafter attracting crabs settling down and regulating feeding area of water birds and other benthic communities are good strategies to follow.

TI  - Lower limits of Spartina densiflora and S-maritima in a Mediterranean salt marsh determined by different ecophysiological tolerances
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 Salt marshes in south-west Spain are being invaded by Spartina densiflora, a South American introduction, although the native S. maritima still dominates many lower marshes. A transplant experiment was used to investigate the means by which physical and chemical factors may determine lower vegetation limits in the tidal frame. Both species were transplanted from a mid-level marsh to lower, unvegetated tidal flats.2 The survival and growth of transplanted clumps and their constituent tillers were monitored on an elevational gradient. The photosynthetic competence of transplants was assessed by measurements of leaf gas exchange and the fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence. Submergence period, salinity, redox potential and sulphide concentration in the sediment were also examined at the transplant sites.3 Neither species survived for a year at the lowest transplant point (+ 1.04 m relative to Spanish Hydrographic Zero). At + 1.41 m elevation, S. maritima survived well but all clumps of S. densiflora died. At higher elevations (+ 1.46-1.67 m), clumps of both species had high survival rates. Tiller growth rates in surviving clumps of both species increased with elevation, but that of S. densiflora was more sensitive to low elevation.4 S. maritima showed no impairment of photosynthetic performance, even at the lowest elevation; its rates of gas exchange were independent of elevation, as were its chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. In contrast, in S. densiflora the rate of CO2 uptake declined and stress to photosystem II (Fv/Fp) increased at lower elevations; both of these photosynthetic measurements were linearly related to sediment redox potential. Stomatal conductance did not vary with elevation.5 S. maritima has a potentially wide elevational tolerance and an absolute lower limit substantially below that of S. densiflora. The progressively reduced growth and survival of S. densiflora at lower levels appear to result primarily from impairment of photosynthesis when root conditions are hypoxic. This effect is mediated through effects on the photochemical apparatus rather than on stomatal resistance to CO2 uptake.6 These studies define lower limits to the fundamental niches of the two species in a Mediterranean-type salt marsh and thus provide a basis for future investigations of interactions between them. The correlation between chlorophyll fluorescence and long-term survival of S. densiflora suggests that this short-term measure may be a valuable tool.

TI  - Recent salt marsh development and natural regeneration of reclaimed areas in the Plentzia estuary, N. Spain
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of benthic foraminifera, a range of elements, and. Cs-137 and Pb-210 were studied in surface sediments and 0.5 m cores from the Plentzia estuarine marshes (northern Spain) to determine the recent development of these previously reclaimed coastal areas. These marshes receive abundant calcium carbonate from regional rocks and this allows calcareous foraminifera to colonize all marsh sub environments. Good preservation of the original foraminiferal assemblages in the buried sediments is also favoured by high regional background carbonate. Benthic foraminifera are shown to be sensitive to both elevation above mean sea level (exposure) and salinity. Results from the chemical analyses indicate moderate anthropogenic pollution in the estuary, and maximum input seems to have occurred in the 1960s. Recent marsh foraminiferal assemblages are good analogues for the palaeo environmental interpretation of historical and Holocene cores, and the combined micropalaeontological/geochemical approach is demonstrated to be successful for the identification of short-term anthropogenic impacts on this coastal region.

T2  - Revista Brasileira de Biologia
M3  - Article
AB  - The Carbon-13 isotopic composition (.delta.13C) of Spartina alterniflora and of the sediment at three different depths were determined in the "Pedra de Guaratiba salt marsh (Rio de Janeiro, RJ). Values obtained for the Spartina alterniflora ranged between-13.0.permill. and -14.3.permill.. Leaves, stem, rhizome dead leaves and decomposing tissues were analysed values obtained for the sediment were -19.3.permill. (0-2 cm), -19.5.permill. (2-17 cm) and -24.4.permill. (17-32 cm), clearly indicating the contribution of Spartina alterniflora for the organic matter in the surface layers. Isotope dilution calculations showed that about 50% of the organic matter in the first 17 cm of the sediment is derived from Spartina alterniflora.

TI  - Natural-abundance radiocarbon as a tracer of assimilation of petroleum carbon by bacteria in salt marsh sediments
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural abundance of radiocarbon (C-14) provides unique insight into the source and cycling of sedimentary organic matter. Radiocarbon analysis of bacterial phospholipid lipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in salt-marsh sediments of southeast Georgia (USA)-one heavily contaminated by petroleum residues-was used to assess the fate of petroleum-derived carbon in sediments and incorporation of fossil carbon into microbial biomass. PLFAs that are common components of eubacterial cell membranes (e.g., branched C-15 and C-17, 10-methyl-C-16) were depleted in C-14 in the contaminated sediment (mean Delta C-14 value of +25 +/- 19 parts per thousand for bacterial PLFAs) relative to PLFAs in uncontaminated "control" sediment (Delta C-14 = +101 +/- 12 parts per thousand). We suggest that the C-14-depletion in bacterial PLFAs at the contaminated site results from microbial metabolism of petroleum and subsequent incorporation of petroleum-derived carbon into bacterial membrane lipids. A mass balance calculation indicates that 6-10% of the carbon in bacterial PLFAs at the oiled site could derive from petroleum residues. These results demonstrate that even weathered petroleum may contain components of sufficient lability to be a carbon source for biomass production by marsh sediment microorganisms. Furthermore, a small but significant fraction of fossil carbon is assimilated even in the presence of a much larger pool of presumably more-labile and faster-cycling carbon substrates.

TI  - Spatial distribution of phosphorus in marsh soils of a typical land/inland water ecotone along a hydrological gradient
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Profile samples from 0 to 70 cm depth were collected in five plant zones along a hydrological gradient in a typical land/inland water ecotone, Northeast China. Total phosphorous (TP), organic phosphorous (OP), inorganic phosphorous (IP) and available phosphorous (AP) were measured to study their horizontal and vertical distribution patterns in the land/inland water ecotone, as well as their important influencing factors such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and water level. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TP, OP, IP and AP were generally higher in the flooding zone (zone A), the over-wetted zone (zone B) and the drying and wetting zone (zone C), but the drying zones (zones D and E) contained lower P concentrations. Soil P was mainly concentrated in upper soils (0-30 cm) and the P levels decreased with depth, except for small accumulative peaks in the 50 to 70 cm soil increment for TP and OP in zone C and for IP and AP in zone A. Surface soils in zones D and E had a lower mean SOC:OP ratio than zones A. B and C, reflecting the higher probability of OP mineralization in the drying zones. However, higher mean values of the IP:OP and AP:TP ratios were found in zone A (P<0.05), indicating that increasing soil moisture may be the most important agent determining IP release rate and biological availability. The significantly positive correlations with soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content would contribute to P retention in zones A. B and C (P<0.01) where the soils contained relatively high organic matter and clay content. The results obtained in this study suggest that the distributions and dynamics of P forms in soil, especially in the land/inland water ecotone, can be significantly impacted by various biogeochemical and environmental factors (i.e., soil moisture, SOM, and clay content).

TI  - Bioturbation has a limited effect on phosphorus burial in salt marsh sediments
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been hypothesized that the evolution of animals during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition stimulated the burial of phosphorus in marine sediments. This assumption is centrally based on data compilations from marine sediments deposited under oxic and anoxic bottom waters. Since anoxia excludes the presence of infauna and sediment reworking, the observed differences in P burial are assumed to be driven by the presence of bioturbators. This reasoning however ignores the potentially confounding impact of bottom-water oxygenation on phosphorus burial. Here, our goal is to test the idea that bioturbation increases the burial of organic and inorganic phosphorus (P-org and P-inorg, respectively) while accounting for bottom-water oxygenation. We present solid-phase phosphorus speciation data from salt marsh ponds with and without bioturbation (Blakeney salt marsh, Norfolk, UK). In both cases, the pond sediments are exposed to oxygenated bottom waters, and so the only difference is the presence or absence of bioturbating macrofauna. Our data reveal that the rate of P-org and P-inorg burial are indistinguishable between bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments. A large terrestrial fraction of organic matter and higher sedimentation velocity than generally found in marine sediments (0.3 +/- 0.1 cm yr(-1)) may partially impact these results. However, the absence of a clear effect of bioturbation on total P burial puts into question the presumed importance of bioturbation for phosphorus burial.

TI  - Using soil profiles of seeds and molecular markers as proxies for sawgrass and wet prairie slough vegetation in Shark Slough, Everglades National Park
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured the abundance of Cladium jamaieense (Crantz) seeds and three biomarkers in freshwater marsh soils in Shark River Slough (SRS), Everglades National Park (ENP) to determine the degree to which these paleoecological proxies reflect spatial and temporal variation in vegetation. We found that C. janiaieense seeds and the biomarkers Paq, total lignin phenols (TLP) and kaurenes analyzed from surface soils were all significantly correlated with extant aboveground C. jamaicense biomass quantified along a vegetation gradient from a C. jamaicense to a wet prairie/slough (WPS) community. Our results also suggest that these individual proxies may reflect vegetation over different spatial scales: Paq and kaurenes correlated most strongly (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.99, respectively) with vegetation within 1 m of a soil sample, while seeds and TLP reflected vegetation 0-20 in upstream of soil samples. These differences in the spatial scale depicted by the different proxies may be complementary in understanding aspects of historic landscape patterning. Soil profiles of short (25 cm) cores showed that downcore variation in C. jamaicense seeds was highly correlated with two of the three biomarkers (Paq, R-2 = 0.84, p < 0.005; TLP, R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001), and all four of the proxies indicated a recent increase in C. jamaicense biomass at the site. Using a preliminary depth-to-age relationship based on matching charcoal peaks with available ENP fire records (1980-present) specific to our coring site, we found that peak-depths in C. jamaicense seed concentration appeared to correspond to recent minimum water levels (e.g., 1989 and 2001), and low seed abundance corresponded to high water levels (e.g., 1995), consistent with the known autecology of C. jamaicense. In summary, the combination of C. jamaicense seeds and biomarkers may be useful for paleoecological reconstruction of vegetation change and ultimately in guaging the success of ongoing efforts to restore historic hydrologic conditions in the South Florida Everglades.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses to copper stress of an invasive cordgrass, Spartina densiflora
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina densiflora Brongn. is found in coastal marshes of south-west Spain, growing in sediments with between 300 and 3000 mg Cu kg(-1) total soil DW (450-4500 ring Cu kg(-1) supposing that the soil porosity is 0.5). An experiment was designed to investigate the effect of copper from 0 to 5000 mg kg(-1) (64 mmol I-1) on the photosynthetic apparatus and the growth of S. densiflora. We also determined total ash. copper, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous concentrations, as well as C/N ratio. S. densiflora survived to concentrations as high as 320 Mg Cu kg(-1) DW in leaves, although excess of Cu diminished water use efficiency and Ca-, Mg- and P-uptake. Also. quantum efficiency of PSII, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and pigment concentrations declined with increasing external Cu. Finally, the decline in the photosynthetic function resulted in a biomass reduction of between 50 and 80% (for 600 and 5000 mg Cu kg(-1), respectively). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced decomposition offsets enhanced productivity and soil carbon accumulation in coastal wetlands responding to climate change
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are responsible for about half of all carbon burial in oceans, and their persistence as a valuable ecosystem depends largely on the ability to accumulate organic material at rates equivalent to relative sea level rise. Recent work suggests that elevated CO2 and temperature warming will increase organic matter productivity and the ability of marshes to survive sea level rise. However, we find in a series of preliminary experiments that organic decomposition rates increase by about 20% per degree of warming. Our measured temperature sensitivity is similar to studies from terrestrial systems, three times as high as the response of salt marsh productivity to temperature warming, and greater than the productivity response associated with elevated CO2 in C-3 marsh plants. Although the experiments were simple and of short duration, they suggest that enhanced CO2 and warmer temperatures could actually make marshes less resilient to sea level rise, and tend to promote a release of soil carbon. Simple projections indicate that elevated temperatures will increase rates of sea level rise more than any acceleration in organic matter accumulation, suggesting the possibility of a positive feedback between climate, sea level rise, and carbon emissions in coastal environments.

AB  - Wetlands can potentially sequester vast amounts of carbon. However, over 50% of wetlands globally have been degraded or lost. Restoration of wetland systems may therefore result in increased sequestration of carbon. Preliminary results of our investigations into atmospheric carbon sequestration by restored coastal wetlands indicate that carbon can be sequestered in substantial quantities in the first 2-50 years after restoration of natural hydrology and sediment accretion processes.

T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Depth distributions of thiosulfate (S2O32-) and sulfite (SO32-) were measured in the porewaters of a Danish salt marsh and subtidal marine sediments by HPLC analysis after derivatization with DTNP [2,2'-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine)]. The distributions were compared to the redox zonation as indicated by Eh and Mn2+, Fe2+, and H2S distributions. Concentrations Of S2O32- varied from below detection (<50 nM) to 600 nM while SO32- concentrations generally were 2-3 times higher, 100-1500 nM. Depth distributions of the two species were roughly similar. Lowest concentrations were found in the oxidized zone, including both the oxic surface layer and the suboxic zone of intense manganese and iron reduction, and concentrations tended to increase through the suboxic and into the reduced, sulfidic zone. The similarity of SO32- and S2O32- profiles suggested a close coupling of the cycling of the two species. Rates of consumption were suggested as the main factor governing their distribution. Rapid turnover times for S2O32- and H2S of 4 and 1. 1 h, respectively, were estimated for the upper 0-1 cm of a subtidal sediment.

TI  - Fish Productivity and Trophic Transfer in Created and Naturally Occurring Salt Marsh Habitat
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High marsh pools are natural features in New England salt marshes that provide important subtidal refuge for the dominant resident fish, Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog). F. heteroclitus is considered an important component in the trophic transfer pathway for its omnivorous diet and role as a prey species providing connectivity to adjacent near-shore and terrestrial habitats. Pool creation, such as ditch-plugging, is a common component of habitat restoration and enhancement projects throughout the region. Our study combined field experiments measuring fish growth and benthic invertebrates with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes measurements to test the hypothesis that ditch plug pools have similar trophic structure and levels of productivity as naturally occurring salt marsh pools. Marked fish placed in enclosures were measured for length and weight weekly in natural pools and pools created using ditch plugs. Benthic invertebrates were sieved and sorted from soil cores to characterize invertebrate community structure, and stable isotopes were used to posit diets and trophic pathways associated with each pool type. Growth in fish length was 27 % higher and instantaneous biomass growth 17 % higher in natural pool habitat than in ditch plug habitat. Likewise, invertebrate species richness, biomass, and caloric value were all significantly greater in natural pool habitat than in ditch plugs. Stable isotope mixing models identified distinct resource utilization and trophic structure for natural and created pools. We attribute these differences to flooding and plant loss in response to ditch-plugging, which reduces habitat quality (as measured by resource availability, community structure, and trophic transfer) for fish and invertebrates. Our study increases our understanding of the ecology of salt marsh pools, and the significant results indicate that pools created using ditch plugs do not replicate the structure and function of natural pools at Moody Marsh.

TI  - Fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane in different coastal Suaeda salsa marshes of the Yellow River estuary, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and associated abiotic sediment parameters were quantified for the first time across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary during 2009/2010. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O and CH4 fluxes from coastal marsh ranged from -0.0147 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1) to 0.0982 mgN(2.) O m(-2) h(-1) and -0.7421 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) to 0.4242 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The mean N2O fluxes in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 0.0325 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), 0.0089 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), 0.0119 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1) and 0.0140 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), and the average CH4 fluxes were -0.0109 mgCH(4-) m(-2) h(-1), -0.0174 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), -0.0141 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and -0.0089 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively, indicating that the coastal marsh acted as N2O source and CH4 sink. Both N2O and CH4 fluxes differed significantly between times of day of sampling. N2O fluxes differed significantly between sampling seasons as well as between sampling positions, while CH4 fluxes had no significant differences between seasons or positions. Temporal variations of N2O emissions were probably related to the effects of vegetation (S. salsa) during summer and autumn and the frequent freeze/thaw cycle of sediment during spring and winter, while those of CH4 fluxes were controlled by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors (soil moisture and salinity). Spatial variations of N2O and CM., fluxes were primarily affected by soil moisture fluctuation derived from astronomic tide, sediment substrate and vegetation composition. N2O and CH4 fluxes, expressed as CO2-equivaltent (CO2-e) emissions, showed that N2O comprised the principal part of total calculated CO2-e emissions during spring and winter, while the contributions of CH4 could not be ignored during summer and autumn. This study highlights the importance of seasonal N2O and CH4 contributions, particularly during times of significant CH4 consumption. For the accurate up-scaling of N2O and CH4 fluxes to annual rates, a careful sampling design at site-level is required to capture the potentially considerable temporal and spatial variations of N2O and CH4 emissions.

TI  - Microbial Community Response to a Passive Salt Marsh Restoration
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to current threats to salt marshes, there are increasing efforts to restore these vital coastal ecosystems and promote their resilience to global change drivers. Unfortunately, the economic cost associated with assessing the effectiveness of restoration is prohibitive and more information is needed about the trajectory and timing of restoration outcomes to improve restoration practices. Microbial communities provide essential salt marsh functions so assessing the degree to which microbial communities in restored marshes resemble reference marshes can serve as a proxy indicator for the potential return of microbial function. We studied a recently restored marsh located on Cape Cod, MA, USA, by examining shifts in the microbial community and sediment edaphic properties in three habitats of a degraded oligohaline marsh, both before and after restoration of tidal flooding and in comparison with three nearbyS. alterniflorareference marshes that never had flow restrictions. We hypothesized that the microbial community would respond rapidly to the restoration and that over time these communities would be indistinguishable from reference marsh communities. We found that soil edaphic characteristics shifted along a trajectory of recovery toward the reference marshes, with increases in salinity and decreases in soil organic matter, percentage of carbon, and percentage of nitrogen. The microbial communities in all three habitats within the restored marsh were different from reference marshes, and both the prokaryotic and fungal communities withinP. australisandTyphasp. habitats became more similar to reference marshes (similarities increasing from an average of 5 to 16% for prokaryotes and 3 to 10% for fungi) during the first 2 years after restoration. In that same time period, by contrast, there was no return of the native marsh vegetation. These results suggest that shifts in microbial community structure occur prior to shifts in marsh vegetation and may facilitate the successful revegetation of restored marshes. Understanding the recovery trajectory of marshes during restoration and the role that microbes play in promoting the long-term sustainability of these habitats is essential; these results suggest that microbial communities respond rapidly and in a positive direction to restoration efforts.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of an Amphibolis griffithii seagrass bed
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Australia has a rich diversity of seagrasses, many of which are meadow-forming species with a high diversity of associated epiphytes. Potential food sources and dominant invertebrates and fishes were collected in a non-quantitative sampling programme designed to examine the variability in naturally occurring isotopes (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) within an Amphibolis griffithii dominated seagrass bed in Western Australia. The aims of this study were to determine the isotopic composition of the organisms, and to determine the sources of carbon available to consumers using the variations in the ratio of N-15/N-14 and C-13/C-12 among organisms in the seagrass assemblage. Autotrophs showed a wide distribution of delta C-13 values, with seagrass material significantly enriched in C-13 relative to macroalgal sources by > 10 parts per thousand. This variation allowed us to successfully identify macroalgae as the main contributor of carbon to the trophic structure. delta N-15 ratios did not vary to the degree that would make it useful as tracer, but it was applied to estimating the total number of trophic transfers of nitrogen. Analysis of delta N-15 values suggested that four trophic positions were present, with fishes (Acanthallitcres vittiger, Scobonichthys granulatus and Siphonognathus radiatus, Pelsartia humeralis, Pelates sexlineatus, Leviprora inops, Odax acroptilus and Notolabrus parilus) occupying the top two levels. delta C-13 of seston (20-200 mu m) and sedimentary organic matter indicate that seagrass material is the main contributor to these two carbon pools, and that very little of it is incorporated into the trophic structure.

AB  - These data were collected from a small (14 ha), created salt marsh in Carteret County, North Carolina (34.82 deg. N; 76.61 deg. W). This site was created in 2007 following an engineering plan developed by Dr. Michael Burchell (NC-State University). This data collection was to support the development of a site-specific carbon budget. Data were collected from 2011 to 2013, or approximately 4-6 years post-creation. The data collection specifically funded by the U.S. Geological Survey includes plant carbon biomass, plant above ground biomass, plant below ground biomass, plant decomposition, and soil greenhouse gas fluxes, and these data are being made available. These data represent critical components of the carbon budget, and were previously missing from on-going study efforts focusing on other aspects of on-site carbon cycling. Other components of the carbon budget, for example dissolved and hydrological flux variables, were funded directly by North Carolina State University, and not included here.

TI  - Impact of Iron Amendment on Net Methylmercury Export from Tidal Wetland Microcosms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands can be important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems. As a result, wetland restoration could increase MeHg concentrations. Previous research has shown that addition of Fe[II] to wetland sediment can reduce MeHg production by decreasing concentrations of bioavailable Hg complexes with dissolved sulfur species. In this study, the potential for reducing MeHg production via an iron amendment was evaluated in laboratory microcosms that used intact sediments from a tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay. The microcosms were maintained under simulated tidal conditions and amended at four iron doses (0, 180, 360, and 720 g-Fe/m(2)). Two experiments were conducted: one with devegetated sediments and one with live wetland vegetation. Following iron addition to the devegetated sediments, porewater S[-II] concentrations decreased for each dose relative to the control with the average weekly export of MeHg in the surface water decreased by 82% and 89% for the two highest doses, respectively. Despite substantial variability within treatment groups, similar trends were observed for the vegetated microcosms. The results suggest that iron addition has the potential to provide a landscape-scale control on MeHg released by restored tidal wetlands; however, additional research is required to evaluate the efficacy of this approach under field conditions.

TI  - Soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater influenced wetlands (FIW), wetlands impacted by both freshwater flooding and underground seawater (MIW) and seawater influenced wetlands (SIW) were chosen as sampling sites to investigate the variations in the soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that a salinity gradient developed as the hydrologic conditions ranged from freshwater to seawater. In 0-50cm soils, the mean values of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and readily oxidized organic carbon (ROOC) were higher in FIW and SIW than those in MIW, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a higher mean value in MIW. Along the 0-50cm soil profile, SOC, MBC, ROOC and DOC decreased as the soil depth increased in FIW and SIW. However, in MIW, soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later. The annual mean values of SOC in 0-50 cm soils were 6.87 g/kg in FIW, 4.92 g/kg in MIW and 5.42 g/kg in SIW, respectively. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) values for FIW, MIW and SIW were 4.55, 3.26 and 3.84 kg C/m(2), respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that SOC, ROOC and DOC were significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, bulk density (BD), sand content, and the C/N ratio, and positively related with water content (WC), silt content, and TN (p < 0.05). However, MBC showed a significantly negative relationship with EC, salt ions content, pH, BD and the C/N ratio, and a significantly positive correlation with TN (p < 0.05).

TI  - Habitat context influences nitrogen removal by restored oyster reefs
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many ecosystem functions in marine and terrestrial environments, nutrient processing varies dramatically over small spatial scales, making efforts to apply findings within and across ecosystems challenging. In estuaries, information on the influence of habitat context on sediment nutrient cycling is lacking even though this is an important estuarine function with high societal value. We collected triplicate intact sediment cores from restored oyster reefs located in different habitat contexts (adjacent to salt marshes, seagrass beds and mudflats), as well as salt marshes, seagrass beds and mudflats without reefs (controls). Sediment denitrification and fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were measured under ambient and experimentally elevated water column nitrate levels. Under ambient nitrate, oyster reefs enhanced sediment denitrification by 18-275% over the controls, with highest rates of denitrification in the mudflat context. With experimentally elevated nitrate, the rate of denitrification was higher for oyster reefs compared to the controls in all contexts. This suggests that oyster reefs prime sediments to denitrify nitrate pulses by providing a labile carbon source for denitrifying bacteria. There was a weak positive relationship between oyster density and denitrification under ambient nitrate concentrations and a positive relationship with denitrification that became negative beyond approximate to 2400 individuals m(-2) with elevated nitrate concentrations. The effect of the oyster reef on sediment denitrification was most pronounced in the mudflat context, due to the absence of other structured habitats and higher oyster density, compared to the other two habitat contexts investigated. The consistency of denitrification efficiency across the habitats and lack of difference between habitats with reefs and those without (controls) suggest oyster-mediated denitrification is an effective sink for nitrogen in coastal systems.Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that oyster-mediated denitrification is dependent on the habitat context of the oyster reef, and variation in oyster density and the relative functional redundancy of oyster reefs where other structured habitats exist (e.g. seagrass and salt marshes) may explain this pattern. Efforts to model and predict ecosystem services provided through oyster reef restoration such as the removal of anthropogenically derived nitrogen should incorporate how habitat context influences ecosystem functions.Our study indicates that oyster-mediated denitrification is dependent on the habitat context of the oyster reef, and variation in oyster density and the relative functional redundancy of oyster reefs where other structured habitats exist (e.g. seagrass and salt marshes) may explain this pattern.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of dissolved oxygen in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ria de Aveiro is a very important area of the Portuguese coast, which has been under an increasing anthropogenic pressure, for several decades, contributing to the degradation of the lagoon's water quality.A water quality model was applied to predict concentrations of inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. Both data and modelling results point out that the DO distribution in the lagoon is controlled by tidal transport processes. The DO distribution in the Ria de Aveiro seems to be mainly controlled by tidal processes, as its concentration remains relatively high and close to sea values. The far end of the lagoon, where the intertidal salt marshes are important, the DO concentration is dominantly affected by re-aeration and the flooding/drying processes over the intertidal salt marshes, the phytoplankton activity, the nitrification processes and oxidation of the organic matter. These processes play an important role in the creation of the summer hypoxic/anoxic situations, when primary production and advective transport are low. Data and modelling results show strong relationship between nutrients and the CHL-a concentrations during spring-summer, but weak during winter-spring, evidencing the light and nutrients limiting effect during, respectively the last and the former period. High NO3 and NH4 concentrations or important spikes in the concentration precede or coincide, in general, with the CHL-a increase. The main results concerning the DO evolution and distribution demonstrate that a generalized eutrophication state is unlikely to occur within the lagoon, except near its very far end, during summer and in a situation of high BOD concentrations. The good connection between Ria de Aveiro lagoon and the sea and the circulation pattern inside the lagoon are, therefore, responsible for relatively high level of oxygen water content in the water column, throughout its main channels.

TI  - How Wetlands Affect Floods
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Review
AB  - It is widely recognised that wetlands play an important role in the hydrological cycle, influencing groundwater recharge, low flows, evaporation and floods. This has led to policies being formulated world-wide to conserve and manage wetlands to deliver these key services, especially flood risk reduction. Generic statements have often been published about wetland hydrological services but the term "wetlands" covers many land types, including wet woodlands, reedbeds, peat bogs, fens, and salt marshes. Each of these wetland types can have a hydrological function that is subtly different, making it difficult to generalise the flood reduction services of wetlands. In this paper we focus on two example wetland types (upland rain-fed wetlands and floodplain wetlands) to demonstrate why there are differences in flood functions both within and between wetland types. Upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods. However, landscape location and configuration, soil characteristics, topography, soil moisture status and management all influence whether these wetlands provide flood reduction services.

TI  - The Green Berry Consortia of the Sippewissett Salt Marsh: Millimeter-Sized Aggregates of Diazotrophic Unicellular Cyanobacteria
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial interactions driving key biogeochemical fluxes often occur within multispecies consortia that form spatially heterogeneous microenvironments. Here, we describe the "green berry" consortia of the Sippewissett salt marsh (Falmouth, MA, United States): millimeter-sized aggregates dominated by an uncultured, diazotrophic unicellular cyanobacterium of the order Chroococcales (termed GB-CYN1). We show that GB-CYN1 is closely related to Crocosphaera watsonii (UCYN-B) and "Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa" (UCYN-A), two groups of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that play an important role in marine primary production. Other green berry consortium members include pennate diatoms and putative heterotrophic bacteria from the Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Tight coupling was observed between photosynthetic oxygen production and heterotrophic respiration. When illuminated, the green berries became supersaturated with oxygen. From the metagenome, we observed that GB-CYN1 encodes photosystem II genes and thus has the metabolic potential for oxygen production unlike UCYN-A. In darkness, respiratory activity rapidly depleted oxygen creating anoxia within the aggregates. Metagenomic data revealed a suite of nitrogen fixation genes encoded by GB-CYN1, and nitrogenase activity was confirmed at the whole-aggregate level by acetylene reduction assays. Metagenome reads homologous to marker genes for denitrification were observed and suggest that heterotrophic denitrifiers might co-occur in the green berries, although the physiology and activity of facultative anaerobes in these aggregates remains uncharacterized. Nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean was long thought to be driven by filamentous cyanobacterial aggregates, though recent work has demonstrated the importance of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria (UCYN) from the order Chroococcales.The green berries serve as a useful contrast to studies of open ocean UCYN and may provide a tractable model system to investigate microbial dynamics within phytoplankton aggregates, a phenomenon of global importance to the flux of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen in surface waters.

Weed Research52, 269276. Summary Flooding has been described as one of the most important environmental factors determining the distribution of salt marsh plants. We studied the impact of five water levels (from well-drained to 8 cm deep) on the germination and establishment of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora under controlled glasshouse conditions. The germination rate was ca. 60%, tending to decrease gradually with depth. There was no seedling emergence from deeper than 4 cm, because every seedling at 8 cm died. Spartina densiflora showed a high physiological plasticity. Seven months after germination, relative water content varied between 69 +/- 13% at well-drained conditions and 87 +/- 7% at 4 cm, without significant differences between treatments. Plants rooted at 4 cm presented the highest quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) with slightly lower maximum net photosynthesis rate than other treatments, reflecting high photoprotection levels, together with low nitrogen and pigments contents. Water level depth reduced shoot relative growth rate (RGR). Our results could be useful to fight S.similar to densiflora invasion, because artificial inundation of invaded marshes to a water depth of 8 cm would prevent its establishment from the seed bank.

TI  - Exotic Spartina alterniflora Enhances the Soil Functions of a Coastal Ecosystem
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal soils are recognized as a valuable global resource because of their important roles in maintaining ecosystem services, especially C storage. Exotic species often have negative impacts on biodiversity but less is known about their potential benefits for soil function. We investigated impacts of Spartina alterniflora Loisel. on soil functions (based on basic chemical and physical properties) related to soil depth on a coastline of the East China Sea. Subsequently, we assessed the trend of soil functions by integrating multiple soil functions into a single index. The results showed that significant relationships were observed between the age of S. alterniflora and the factors soil organic C (SOC) storage soil pH in the topsoil (30 cm), and soil salinity within the upper 1 m depth. These results implied that some soil functions were enhanced over time following the introduction of the species (i.e., C sequestration and desalinization). Spartina alterniflora had a positive effect on the basic functionality of soils in areas that do not have native salt marsh species. Over the course of exotic plant introduction, soil pH made the highest contribution at the beginning, whereas salinity gradually became the most important factor controlling the physicochemical functionality of soils. We suggest that it is essential to explicitly test the impacts of species introduction on soil functions to address key issues of the sustainable management of coastal soils.

TI  - Utilization of a citizen monitoring protocol to assess the structure and function of natural and stabilized fringing salt marshes in North Carolina
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Narrow fringing salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora occur naturally along estuarine shorelines and provide many of the same ecological functions as more extensive marshes. These fringing salt marshes are sometimes incorporated into shoreline stabilization efforts. We obtained data on elevation, salinity, sediment characteristics, vegetation and fish utilization at three study sites containing both natural fringing marshes and nearby restored marshes located landward of a stone sill constructed for shoreline stabilization. During the study, sediment accretion rates in the restored marshes were approximately 1.5- to 2-fold greater than those recorded in the natural marshes. Natural fringing marsh sediments were predominantly sandy with a mean organic matter content ranging between 1.5 and 6.0%. Average S. alterniflora stem density in natural marshes ranged between 130 and 222 stems m(-2), while mean maximum stem height exceeded 64 cm. After 3 years, one of the three restored marshes (NCMM) achieved S. alterniflora stem densities equivalent to that of the natural fringing marshes, while percentage cover and maximum stem heights were significantly greater in the natural than in the restored marshes at all sites. There was no significant difference in the mean number of fish, crabs or shrimp captured with fyke nets between the natural and restored marshes, and only the abundance of Palaemonetes vulgaris (grass shrimp) was significantly greater in the natural marshes than in the restored ones. Mean numbers of fish caught per 5 m of marsh front were similar to those reported in the literature from marshes adjacent to tidal creeks and channels, and ranged between 509 and 634 fish net(-1). Most of the field data and some of the sample analyses were obtained by volunteers as they contributed 223 h of the total 300 h spent collecting data from three sites in one season. The use of fyke nets required twice as many man-hours as any other single task. Vegetation and sediment parameters were sensitive indicators of marsh restoration success, and volunteers were capable of contributing a significant portion of the labor needed to collect these parameters.

TI  - Biomass, decomposition and nutrient cycling in a SW Atlantic Sarcocornia perennis marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass dynamics, decomposition and nutrient cycling were studied in a Sarcocornia perennis salt marsh in the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina) to achieve a better understanding of these processes and provide information about a species and a region underrepresented in the literature. Above and belowground biomass stocks and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration in plant tissues were monitored every 2 months during a year. The decomposition rate and the concentration of C, N and P during the process were also estimated in above and belowground tissues. Biomass values were low (mean of 363 +/- 43 and 242 +/- 27 g m(-2) for aboveground and belowground tissues, respectively), presumably associated with the high salinity of this estuary. The general trend of higher values for aboveground biomass is in agreement with other reports for this species and has an effect on nutrients pools, which are higher for aboveground tissues for C and N. Above and belowground decomposition rates were high (64 and 70% after a year, respectively), meaning this process plays a significant role in the cycling of organic matter. C/N and C/P ratios changed during decomposition, but final ratios were usually higher, suggesting a net release of nutrients. Our results indicate that significant amounts of C, N and P are recycled by Sarcocornia perennis, highlighting the role of this species and suggesting important consequences of its lost in the study area.

Six samples taken over the course of a year were extracted to ensure representation of shifts in SRB community tied to seasonal growth cycles of the marsh grass Spartina. A clone library was constructed using 385F (selective for delta-Proteobacterial SRB) and 1492R (general bacteria) primers. Phylogenetic relationships were determined by the neighbor-joining method, whereas overall sampling efficiency and diversity were estimated using rarefaction analysis and the Chao-1 richness estimator. The primers also amplified other groups, such as epsilon-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cytophaga/Flexibacter, since the primer target sequences that are shared by almost all delta-Proteobacterial SRB, also occur in representatives of other bacterial lineages. We analyzed more than 1,000 sequences and over 50% belonged to members of delta-Proteobacteria. Among the delta-Proteobacteria, most of the ribotypes (unique 16S rRNA sequences) were associated with members of the Desulfobacteriaceae (Desulfosarcina, Desulfobacterium and Desulfonema) and Desulfobulbaceae (Desulfobulbus, Desulfofustis and Desulfotalea) group. Sequences from the Desulfomicrobiaceae and Desulfoarculaceae groups were also observed. Over two thirds of the delta-Proteobacterial ribotypes were most similar to Desulfosarcina and Desulfobacterium, suggesting that complete oxidizers dominate this environment. This is supported by a previous study in which Desulfobacteriaceae accounted for up to 2 5% of the total Bacteria rRNA in the marsh sediments. Furthermore, no close relatives of Desulfovibrio were detected, despite their sequence match to the amplification primers and previous reports suggesting their presence in marsh sediments.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Coastal marshes are highly valued for ecosystem services such as protecting inland habitats from storms, sequestering carbon, removing nutrients and other pollutants from surface water, and providing habitat for fish, shellfish, and birds. Because plants largely determine the structure and function of coastal marshes, quantifying plant biomass is essential for evaluating these ecosystem services, understanding the biogeochemical processes that regulate ecosystem function, and forecasting tidal wetland responses to accelerated sea level rise. Allometry is a convenient and efficient technique for nondestructive estimation of plant biomass, and it is commonly used in studies of carbon and nitrogen cycles, energy flows, and marsh surface elevation change. We present plant allometry data and models developed for three long-term experiments at the Smithsonian Global Change Research Wetland, a brackish marsh in the Rhode River subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. The dataset contains 9,771 measurements of stem height, dry mass, and (in 9638 cases) stem width across 11 plant species. The vast majority of observations are for Schoenoplectus americanus (8430) and Phragmites australis (311), with fewer observations for other common species: Amaranthus cannabinus, Atriplex patula, Iva frutescens, Kosteletzkya virginica, Polygonum hydropiper, Solidago sempervirens, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina cynosuroides, and Typha angustifolia. Allometric relationships take the form of linear regressions of biomass (transformed using the Box-Cox procedure) on either stem height and width, or on stem height alone. Allometric relationships for Schoenoplectus americanus were not meaningfully altered by elevated CO2, N enrichment, the community context, interannual variation in climate, or year, showing that a single equation can be used across a broad range of conditions for this species. Archived files include: (1) raw data used to derive allometric equations for each species, (2) reports and evaluations of the allometric equations we derived from the data, and (3) R code with which our derivations can be replicated. Methodological details of our experiments, data collection efforts, and statistical modeling are described in the metadata. The allometric equations can be used for biomass estimation in empirical and modeling studies of North American coastal wetlands, and the data can be used in ecological studies of terrestrial plant allometry.

TI  - Role of Tidal Wetland Stability in Lateral Fluxes of Particulate Organic Matter and Carbon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetland fluxes of particulate organic matter and carbon (POM, POC) are important terms in global budgets but remain poorly constrained. Given the link between sediment fluxes and wetland stability, POM and POC fluxes should also be related to stability. We measured POM and POC fluxes in eight microtidal salt marsh channels, with net POM fluxes ranging between -12133 (export) and10228 (import)gOMm(-2)year(-1) and net POC fluxes ranging between -5214 and4312gCm(-2)year(-1). A regression employing two measures of stability, the unvegetated-vegetated marsh ratio (UVVR) and elevation, explained >95% of the variation in net fluxes. The regression indicates that marshes with lower elevation and UVVR import POM and POC while higher elevation marshes with high UVVR export POM and POC. We applied these relationships to marsh units within Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, finding a net POM import of 2,3551,570Mg OM/year (15 +/- 10g OMm(-2)year(-1)) and a net POC import of 1,263 +/- 632Mg C/year (8 +/- 4g Cm(-2)year(-1)). The magnitude of this import was similar to an estimate of POM and POC export due to edge erosion (-2,535Mg OM/year and-1,291Mg C/year), suggesting that this system may be neutral from a POM and POC perspective. In terms of a net budget, a disintegrating wetland should release organic material, while a stable wetland should trap material. This study quantifies that concept and demonstrates a linkage between POM/POC flux and geomorphic stability.Plain Language Summary The worldwide budgets of organic material, especially carbon, are important to understand future climate change, environmental health, and habitat change. Tidal wetlands and salt marshes are large banks of organic material and carbon that can store material over centuries or lose it quickly if they are eroded by waves or submerged by sea level rise. We measured the deposits and withdrawals from this organic material bank, at eight salt marshes across the United States. We found a wide range of deposits and withdrawals and determined that the budget is related to how stable the marsh is. Marshes with a lot of plants and more height were more likely to have deposits of organic materials, while marshes with less plants and less height had withdrawals. These results will help complete the accounting of organic material and carbon in worldwide budgets.

TI  - Two-decade wetland cultivation and its effects on soil properties in salt marshes in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland cultivation and its effects on soil properties in salt marshes in the Yellow River Delta, China were examined by using a combination of the satellite imageries and field experiments. Results showed that the conversions mainly occurred between dry lands and Phragmites australis-Suaeda salsa-Tamarix chinensis marshes (PSTMs). The total area of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986 to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH, salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH, salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in NO3--N. TN (total nitrogen), and AP (available phosphorus) (P < 0.05) was observed. The more loss of soil nutrient storage also occurred after the maximal area conversion from PSTMs to dry lands compared to other conversions during the study period. The storages of soil organic matter, NH4+-N and total phosphorus decreased greatly under the conversion from three types of marshes to dry lands, while those of NO3--N, AP and TN showed an obvious increase during the whole study period.

TI  - Influence of Spartina alterniflora on superficial sediment characteristics of tidal flats in Paranagua Bay (South-Eastern Brazil)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Superficial sediment characteristics of salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated sites were compared in Paranagua Bay, SE Brazil, in order to assess the influence of Spartina alterniflora. Twenty stations were sampled along a salinity and environmental gradient, from the inner to the outer bay, to provide a first characterization of sediment distribution along the tidal flats. Paranagua Bay was then divided into three different sectors according to the hydrodynamic regime and sediment characteristics. The mesohaline sector is characterized by typically fluid sediments, with the predominance of medium silt, and high organic and water contents. Deposits of the middle polyhaline sector are poorly sorted, very fine sands, with variable organic matter content. Sediments in the higher-energy euhaline sector are well-sorted fine sands, with lent organic content. Four sampling sites were chosen in different sectors to assess whether S. alterniflora marshes can introduce differences in sediment texture along spatial and seasonal gradients. Differences in sediment parameters between marshes and unvegetated tidal flats are not evident in the inner sector, but are increasingly significant towards the high-energy euhaline sector. With the exception of water and organic content, the latter usually higher in summer, seasonal differences in sediment parameters are not significant. The results suggest that differences between the sediments of salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated tidal flats are positively correlated with the environmental energy gradient along Paranagua Bay. Sand unavailability and high sedimentation rates lead to a marked sedimentological homogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated flats in the upper reaches of the bay. On the other hand, S. alterniflora is a major source of sediment heterogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated sites in the high-energy euhaline sector, characterized by more mature sediments.

TI  - Effect of ultraviolet-B radiation on salt marsh vegetation: Trends of the genus Salicornia along the Americas
T2  - PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of natural UV-B radiation on growth, photosynthetic and photoprotective pigment composition of different Salicornia species were analyzed in salt marshes at three different sites along the Americas (Puerto Rico, southern Brazil and Patagonia, Argentina). Plants were exposed to different levels of UV-B radiation for 1-2 years in situ as well as in outdoor garden UV-B exclusion experiments. Different UV-B levels were obtained by covering plants with UV-B opaque (blocked 93-100% of ambient UV-B) and UV-B attenuating (near-ambient) filters (reduced 20-25% of UV-B). Unfiltered plants were exposed to natural irradiance. UV-B filters had significant effects on temperature and photosynthetic pigments (due to changes in PAR; 400-700 nm). The growth of Salicornia species was inhibited after 35 to 88 days of exposure to mean UV-B radiation dosages between 3.6 and 4.1 kJ m(-2) day(-1). The highest number of branches on the main shoot (S. bigelovii and S. gaudichaudiana) and longest total length of the branches (S. gaudichaudiana) were observed in the UV-B opaque treatment. Salicornia species responded to increasing levels of UV-B radiation by increasing the amount of UV-B absorbing pigments up to 330%. Chromatographic analyses of seedlings and adult S. bigelovii plants found seven different UV-B absorbing flavonoids that are likely to serve as UV-B filtering pigments. No evidence of differential sensitivity or resilience to UV-B radiation was found between Salicornia species from low-mid latitudes and a previously published study of a high-latitude population.

TI  - Using Noble Gases to Compare Parameterizations of Air-Water Gas Exchange and to Constrain Oxygen Losses by Ebullition in a Shallow Aquatic Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of air-water gas exchange fluxes is critically important for calculating ecosystem metabolism rates from dissolved oxygen in shallow aquatic environments. We present a unique data set of the noble gases neon, argon, krypton, and xenon in a salt marsh pond to demonstrate how the dissolved noble gases can be used to quantify gas transfer processes and evaluate gas exchange parameterizations in shallow, near-shore environments. These noble gases are sensitive to a variety of physical processes, including bubbling. We thus additionally use this data set to demonstrate how dissolved noble gases can be used to assess the contribution of bubbling from the sediments (ebullition) to gas fluxes. We find that while literature gas exchange parameterizations do well in modeling more soluble gases, ebullition must be accounted for in order to correctly calculate fluxes of the lighter noble gases. In particular, for neon and argon, the ebullition flux is larger than the differences in the diffusive gas exchange flux estimated by four different wind speed-based parameterizations for gas exchange. We present an application of noble gas derived ebullition rates to improve estimates of oxygen metabolic fluxes in this shallow pond environment. Up to 21% of daily net oxygen production by photosynthesis may be lost from the pond via ebullition during some periods of biologically and physically produced supersaturation. Ebullition could be an important flux of oxygen and other gases that is measurable with noble gases in other shallow aquatic environments.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of methane dynamics in the tropical mangrove dominated estuary, NE coast of Bay of Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal and spatial variation of dissolved and atmospheric methane (CH4) was measured in the estuaries of the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem from January to December 2003. This unique mangrove forest ecosystem (9630 km(2)), a part of the Hooghly-Matia estuarine system (NE coast of Bay of Bengal) comprises about 3% of the total area of the world's mangroves. Dissolved methane concentrations in the mangrove dominated estuarine water (Muriganga, Saptamukhi and Thakuran) were observed between 11.0 and 129.0 nmol L-1 with emission rates between 1.97 and 134.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Methane emission showed maximum rate during post-monsoon when phytoplankton reached blooming proportion. During post-rnonsoon materials transported from the mangrove forest could stimulate phytoplankton bloom when transparency of water column was increased and river input of nutrient was low. However, dissolved methane concentrations in the Hooghly estuary, the main river water flushing channel showed lower values between 10.3 and 59.25 nmol L-1 with emission rates between 0.88 and 148.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Methane concentrations in the salinity gradient zone of the Hooghly estuary did not show any decreasing trend with increased salinity due to its lateral transport from the mangrove forest situated at the lower stretch of the estuary. Dissolved methane concentration in the pore water collected from the virgin mangrove forest showed a maximum concentration of 5769 nmol L-1 which was considerably lower compared to that of coastal salt marsh, tidal fresh water wetland. This indicated intense oxidation or out competition of methanogenic bacteria by sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria. Methane emission from the adjacent forest ecosystem (18.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was higher compared to that in the mangrove water. Considering methane emission rates from the aquatic and forest ecosystems, an area average rate of 47.28 x 10(5) mol km(-2) yr(-1) for Sundarban mangrove environment was obtained. Extrapolating over the global area covered by mangrove forest with area average soil methane emission rate without considering its emission from water could yield inaccurate estimation.

TI  - Changes in methanogenic substrate utilization and communities with depth in a salt-marsh, creek sediment in southern England
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A combined biogeochemical and molecular genetic study of creek sediments (down to 65 cm depth) from Arne Peninsula salt-marsh (Dorset, UK) determined the substrates used for methanogenesis and the distribution of the common methanogens, Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales capable of metabolising these substrates. Methane concentrations increased by 11 cm, despite pore water sulphate not being removed until 45 cm. Neither upward methane diffusion or anaerobic oxidation of methane seemed to be important in this zone. In the near-surface sulphate-reduction zone (5-25 cm) turnover time to methane for the non-competitive methanogenic substrate trimethylamine was most rapid (80 days), and were much longer for acetate (7900 days), methanol (40,500 days) and bicarbonate (361,600 days). Methylamine-utilizing Methanosarcinales were the dominant (60-95%) methanogens in this zone. In deeper sediments rates of methanogenesis from competitive substrates increased substantially, with acetate methanogenic rates becoming similar to 100 times greater than H-2/CO2 methanogenesis below 50 cm. In addition, there was a dramatic change in methanogen diversity with obligate acetate-utilizing, Methanosaeta related sequences being dominant. At a similar depth methanol turnover to methane increased to its most rapid (1700 days). This activity pattern is consistent with deeper methanogen populations (55 cm) being dominated by acetate-utilizing Methanosaeta with H-2/CO2 and alcohol-utilizing Methanomicrobiales also present. Hence, there is close relationship between the depth distribution of methanogenic substrate utilization and specific methanogens that can utilize these compounds. It is unusual for acetate to be the dominant methanogenic substrate in coastal sediments and delta C-13-CH4 values (-74 to -71 parts per thousand) were atypical for acetate methanogenesis, suggesting that common stable isotope proxy models may not apply well in this type of dynamic anoxic sediment, with multiple methanogenic substrates.

TI  - The role of bioturbation by Ucides cordatus crab in the fractionation and bioavailability of trace metals in tropical semiarid mangroves
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the burrowing activity of U. cordatus and its effects on Fe, Cu and Zn fractionation, bioavailability and bioaccumulation in a semiarid mangrove area (Ceara state, NE-Brazil). Were analyzed the Eh; pH; grain size and pore water composition; total S and organic C, and the speciation of Fe, Cu and Zn solid-phases in two areas: a densely populated crab and a control site. The burrowing activity and seasonal variation affect the biogeochemical conditions of mangrove soils increasing metals bioavailability and bioaccumulation. The crab burrows favors the entrance of oxygen into the soil, oxidizing the pyrite and forming poorly-crystalline Fe minerals, increasing the risks of biocontamination. Furthermore, the metals content in the hepatopancreas are a good proxy for the evaluation of bioavailable metal forms and, thus, further studies must be conducted in order to evaluate the potential use of U. cordatus as a bioindicator for trace metals contamination.

TI  - Does historical exposure to hydrocarbon contamination alter the response of benthic communities to diesel contamination?
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A microcosm experiment was used to compare the influence of diesel contamination on two benthic salt-marsh communities, one chronically exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons for decades (Louisiana [LA]) and the other relatively uncontaminated (Mississippi [MS]). Initial meiofaunal community composition of the two sites was similar. Higher organic content of MS sediments should have reduced bioavailability, and thus the toxicity of hydrocarbons relative to the LA site. Nevertheless, although responses to diesel contamination at the two sites were generally qualitatively similar, a species-specific and several community-response variables were influenced to a much greater degree in the MS community. In particular, the abundance of total nauplii, ostracods, and copepods were negatively impacted to a greater extent in MS than in LA, as was grazing by ostracods on benthic microalgae. Nematode:copepod ratios in contaminated sediments were much higher in MS than in LA sediments. Pseudostenhelia wellsi (a benthic copepod) nauplii suffered greater adverse effects of diesel in MS than in LA. We conclude that the MS community was more sensitive to diesel contamination than was the LA community. The differential sensitivity is presumably a manifestation of different tolerances to hydrocarbon contaminants, mediated by a higher proportion of more tolerant species and/or increased tolerance among individual species in LA. Although the MS site was more sensitive to diesel contamination, qualitative responses of the LA and MS communities were similar, and comparable to previous studies of diesel contamination. The spatial and temporal consistency of diesel impacts on salt-marsh communities suggests that hydrocarbon contamination results in predictable community responses. Specifically, crustacean (e.g. copepods, ostracods, and nauplii) benthos are most sensitive to hydrocarbons. Reductions in abundance and grazing activity of crustaceans leads to enhanced algal biomass, reduced copepod diversity, and alters competitive interactions among meiofauna.

TI  - Evidence of spatial and temporal changes in sources of organic matter in estuarine sediments: stable isotope and fatty acid analyses
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated spatial and temporal changes in sources of organic matter in sediments within an estuarine environment in South Africa using fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (SI). Samples of sediments and sources of organic matter [i.e., particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos (MPB), macrophytes, salt marsh plants, and terrestrial leaves] were collected during spring and summer 2012, and autumn and winter 2013 from the upper, middle, and lower reaches. A Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) mixing model was used to identify the organic matter sources contributing to sediments in each estuarine reach and season. We found that diatom-associated fatty acids (20:5 omega 3; 16:1 omega 7) increased toward the upper reaches, while long-chained terrigenous fatty acids (24:0) tended to be more prevalent in lower reach sediments. In support of the FA results, the SI mixing model showed a substantial contribution from the marsh grass Spartina maritima in sediments of the lower estuary during periods of low-freshwater discharge (autumn and winter), while MPB was the main component in sediments from the upper and middle reaches during all seasons. Our results have implications for evaluating estuarine food webs since the spatial and seasonal variability in the organic matter deposited can influence estuarine community structure.

TI  - Reclamation-induced tidal restriction increases dissolved carbon and greenhouse gases diffusive fluxes in salt marsh creeks
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal creeks play an important role in transporting nutrients between coastal ecosystems and ocean. Reclamation is a predominant anthropogenic disturbance in coastal regions; however, the influence of reclamation on carbon and nitrogen species and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in creek remains unclear. In a subtropical salt marsh of eastern China, the seasonal patterns of dissolved carbon (DOC, DIC, CO2, and CH4) and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N and N2O) species, and the diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, were compared between the natural tidal creeks and the reclaimed creeks. Due to notably changed hydrological and biological conditions in the reclaimed creeks, concentrations of all dissolved carbon species, NH4+-N and NO2--N increased significantly by 60.2-288.2%, while NO3--N and N2O decreased slightly, compared to the natural tidal creeks. DIC and NO3--N were the primary components of the total dissolved carbon and inorganic nitrogen in both creek types; however, their proportions decreased as a result of elevated DOC, CO2, CH4, NH4+-N, and NO2--N following reclamation. Significantly higher global warming potential (0.58 +/- 0.15 g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1)) was found in the reclaimed creeks, making them hotspot of greenhouse effects, compared to the natural tidal creeks. Our results indicated that changes in flow velocity, salinity, Chlorophyll a, and pH were themain factors controlling the dissolved carbon and nitrogen and consequent GHG emissions, due to reclamation. This study is helpful in understanding of carbon and nitrogen sink-source shifts resulting from land use changes in coastal wetlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nutrient dynamics from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary to the East China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water and sediment samples were collected from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary and the adjacent East China Sea during impoundment of the river at the Three Gorges Dam. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients, and particulate inorganic phosphorus and particulate organic phosphorus in the water column (PIP and POP, respectively) and sediments (SIP and SOP, respectively) were analyzed. The nutrient dynamics in salt marshes associated with the Changjiang estuary were also considered. In addition, river water samples were collected bimonthly in the lower reaches of the Changjiang. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients, PIP and POP showed temporal and spatial variations, which decreased from the coast to offshore areas. The dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus (P) concentrations showed patchy distributions, but were consistent with the distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Phosphorus is the major limiting element for phytoplankton growth. Among the various P forms, particulate P represented 38-52% of total P. The PIP and POP concentrations showed clear seasonal variations corresponding to the occurrence of the levels of suspended particulate matter. The P accumulation rates showed a decreasing trend from the coast to offshore areas, and high P burial efficiencies were found; the latter were related to a low benthic PO43- flux and high sediment accumulation rates. The potential bioavailable P was estimated to be 65-70% of total P, of which more than two-thirds was regenerated in the water column. The salt marsh in the Changjiang estuary plays an important ecological role in nutrient transport from the river to offshore areas, and increased P limitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Plant Response and Adaptation to Anaerobiosis
CL  - LAMMI, FINLAND
AB  - Plants of saline habitats can encounter anoxic conditions to extents which vary with habitat and life form. Rhizophytes (with roots or rhizoids in a sediment) routinely have anoxia or hypoxia in their roots, rhizoids and rhizomes. Haptophytes (attached to large particles of substrate) and planophytes (unattached) are generally less prone to anoxia or hypoxia, exceptions being ice-encased polar haptophytes and estuarine and muddy shore macroscopic planophytes (pleustophytes) which can become hypoxic or anoxic as a result of burial in sediment or under new growth.A major difference between anoxia in low-salinity habitats and anoxia in saline habitats is the presence of high sulphate concentrations in most saline habitats including seawater. Use of sulphate as electron acceptor in microbial oxidation or organic carbon produces sulphide, with relatively less production of methane than in anoxic habitats with lower sulphate concentrations. In addition to its role as a toxin, S-34/S-32 natural abundance data show that S-34-depleted sulphide is directly or indirectly used as a sulphur source for roots and rhizomes of seagrasses and for the whole organism of emergent salt marsh herbs. and mangroves. Granted the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the rhizosphere. its entry by lipid-solution permeation of the plasmalemma is inevitable. The balance of evidence favours the entry of hydrogen sulphide rather than the oxidation of S-34-depleted sulphide to S-34-depleted sulphate in an aerobic rhizosphere with subsequent entry of sulphate.

T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 221st National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society
CL  - NEW ORLEANS, LA
AB  - 3-Mercaptopropionate (3-MPA) is a major hydrophilic thiol in salt marsh sediments from Shelter island, New York. It is associated mainly with the sedimentary particulate phase, although the mechanism of its binding has not been clear. In this study, we show that humic substances coated on clay minerals are involved in binding 3-MPA through di- and poly-sulfide linkages. With increasing depth, the abundance of 3-MPA in the fulvic acid fraction decreases with a concomitant increase in the humic acid fraction, suggesting that, with depth, fulvic-bound 3-MPA is converted into humic-bound 3-MPA. We modeled the depth variation with a multi-G model which suggests that there are two types of reactive components in both fulvic acid-bound and humic acid-bound 3-MPA, one changing about 10 times more rapidly than the other. These two 3-MPA pools probably reflect different types of sulfur bridging, with the polysulfide-bridged pool changing more rapidly than the disulfide-bridged pool. As free thiol, 3-MPA is attacked relatively rapidly by anaerobic bacteria, its degradation following first-order kinetics. However, in the sediment core we studied, humic-bound 3-MPA was present throughout the sediment column, down to 22 cm, corresponding to an age of about 90 years. These results suggest that thiols can escape bacterial degradation in sediments by binding to humic substances. The sedimentary distribution of 3-MPA is an important illustration of the interplay of biological and chemical processes in the fate of thiols in anoxic marine sediments.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide and Methane Dynamics in Three Coastal Systems of Cadiz Bay (SW Spain)
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and concentration of dissolved CH4 in surface waters have been studied in three coastal systems connected to Cadiz Bay (southwestern coast of Spain) over different time scales. The concentration of CH4 varied from 1 to 4200 nmol kg(-1) (192.1 +/- 463.6 nmol kg(-1)) and the saturation percent from 19 to 159,577% (6645 +/- 16,921%), and pCO(2) from 315 to 3240 mu atm (841.9 +/- 466.3 mu atm), with saturation percent values varying between 72 and 981% (220 +/- 133%). The seasonal variation of pCO(2) mainly depends on the temperature. On the contrary, the annual distribution of dissolved CH4 is associated with the precipitation regime. In addition, pCO(2) and dissolved CH4 showed spatial variation. pCO(2) increased toward the inner part of the systems, with the proximity to the discharge points from human activities. Dissolved CH4 is influenced by both anthropogenic inputs and natural processes such as benthic supply and exchange with the adjacent salt marshes. pCO(2) and dissolved CH4 also varied with the tides: The highest concentrations were measured during the ebb, which suggests that the systems export CO2 and CH4 to the Bay and adjacent Atlantic Ocean.

TI  - Molecular Fingerprints of Soil Organic Carbon in Wetlands Covered by Native and Non-native Plants in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compared soil organic carbon (SOC) in wetlands dominated by native and one invasive plant specie to better understand how short-termSpartina alternifloracolonization affected carbon circulation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Freshwater marsh dominated byPhragmites australis(FM) had the highest SOC, total nitrogen (TN), and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) contents, whereas SOC contents varied only slightly among salt marshes covered bySuaeda salsa(SM2),S. alterniflora(SM3) and bare flat (MD). Invasion byS. alterniflorasubstantially changed the molecular characteristics of SOC. The spectral characteristics of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of humic acids (HAs) were similar from 4000 to 1800 cm(-1)but differed greatly from 1800 to 1000 cm(-1)among four wetlands. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technology (Py-GC/MS) was used to characterize molecular fingerprints of HAs. Aliphatics (27.38%), lignin (16.64%), nitrogen-containing compounds (Nc) (16.16%), polysaccharides (16.93%), and phenol (13.42%) were dominant inFM, and aliphatics, alkyl, and Nc were primary in HAs fromMD,SM2, andSM3.Lignin moieties were only found in HAs fromFMandSM3, which accounted for about 16.64% and 1.6% of the total ion current, respectively. The absorption bands of the FTIR spectrum around 3340 and 1650 cm(-1)inFMsamples were much larger than those in the other three wetlands. However, the ratio of the peak areas at 1620 and 2930 cm(-1)(R-1620/2930) inSM3, was lower than that inMDandSM2, and it meant carbon inSM3was less stable. Proportions of lignin and phenol moieties to total ion counts (TIC) inMDandSM2were 3.3% and 3.4%, while these proportions in FM and SM were 30% and 7.5%, respectively. It showedS. alterniflorainvasion into salt marsh would increase SOC contents and its stability, while it will inverse if freshwater marsh was supplanted byS. alterniflorain the YRD.

TI  - Ecosystem Metabolism Modulates the Dynamics of Hypoxia and Acidification Across Temperate Coastal Habitat Types
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in photosynthetic and respiration rates in coastal marine habitats cause considerable variability in ecosystem metabolism on timescales ranging from diel to tidal to seasonal. Here, temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved oxygen (DO), carbonate chemistry, and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) were quantified from spring through fall in multiple, distinct, temperate estuarine habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, an open water estuary, and a shallow water habitat dominated by benthic macroalgae. DO and pH(T) (total scale) measurements were made via high frequency sensor arrays coupled with discrete measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and high-resolution spatial mapping was used to document intra-habitat spatial variability. All habitats displayed clear diurnal patterns of pH(T) and DO that were stronger than tidal signals, with minimums and maximums observed during early morning and afternoon, respectively. Diel ranges in pH(T) and DO varied by site. In seagrass meadows and the open estuarine site, pH(T) ranged 7.8-8.4 and 7.5-8.2, respectively, while DO exceeded hypoxic thresholds and aragonite was typically saturated (omega(Ar) > 1). Conversely, pH(T) in a shallow macroalgal and salt marsh dominated habitats exhibited strong diel oscillations in pH(T) (6.9-8.4) with diel acidic (pH(T) < 7) and hypoxic (DO < 3 mg L-1) conditions often observed during summer along with extended periods of aragonite undersaturation (omega(Ar) < 1). The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) exceeded 3000 and 2000 mu atm in the salt marsh and macroalgal bed, respectively, while pCO(2) never exceeded 1000 mu atm in the seagrass and open estuarine site. Mesoscale (50-100 m) spatial variability was observed across sites with the lowest pH(T) and DO found within regions of more restricted flow. NEM across habitats ranged from net autotrophic (macroalgae and seagrass) to metabolically balanced (open water) and net heterotrophic (salt marsh). Each habitat exhibited distinct buffering capacities, varying seasonally, and modulated by adjacent biological activity and variations in total alkalinity (TA) and DIC. As future predicted declines in pH and DO are likely to shrink the spatial extent of estuarine refuges from acidification and hypoxia, efforts are required to expand seagrass meadows and the aquaculture of macroalgae to maximize their ecosystem benefits and maintain these estuarine refuges.

TI  - True Value of Estuarine and Coastal Nurseries for Fish: Incorporating Complexity and Dynamics
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, salt marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, comprise some of the world's most productive and ecologically significant ecosystems. Currently, the predominant factor considered in valuing coastal wetlands as fish habitats is the contribution they make to offshore, adult fish stocks via ontogenetic migrations. However, the true value of coastal nurseries for fish is much more extensive, involving several additional, fundamentally important ecosystem processes. Overlooking these broader aspects when identifying and valuing habitats risks suboptimal conservation outcomes, especially given the intense competing human pressures on coastlines and the likelihood that protection will have to be focussed on specific locations rather than across broad sweeps of individual habitat types. We describe 10 key components of nursery habitat value grouped into three types: (1) connectivity and population dynamics (includes connectivity, ontogenetic migration and seascape migration), (2) ecological and ecophysiological factors (includes ecotone effects, ecophysiological factors, food/predation trade-offs and food webs) and (3) resource dynamics (includes resource availability, ontogenetic diet shifts and allochthonous inputs). By accounting for ecosystem complexities and spatial and temporal variation, these additional components offer a more comprehensive account of habitat value. We explicitly identify research needs and methods to support a broader assessment of nursery habitat value. We also explain how, by better synthesising results from existing research, some of the seemingly complex aspects of this broader view can be addressed efficiently.

TI  - EARLY DIAGENESIS OF LIGNIN-ASSOCIATED PHENOLICS IN THE SALT-MARSH GRASS SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The predepositional stability of lignin in the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora was examined in two different degradation studies: one was a traditional litterbag study carried out using post-senescent brown leaves in a North Carolina marsh creek, and the other was a study in which senescing, standing plants were tagged and allowed to undergo in situ degradation in a Sapelo Island, Georgia, salt marsh. Based on results from lignin oxidation product (LOP) analysis of leaves, lignin in the S. alterniflora was shown to be significantly degraded in both studies, with 13 +/- 2% and 25 +/- 12% of the total lignin mass loss occurring over the 496-day litterbag and 146-day tagged studies, respectively.A comparison of the results from both studies suggests that most of the calculated lignin loss (>90%) occurs early in the degradation history of the plant, with a significant portion occurring while the plant is still standing in the salt marsh. Further detailed evaluation of this loss demonstrates that selective lignin degradation occurs in S. alterniflora, deriving from the preferential loss of labile lignin moieties. The most labile component, trans-ferulic acid, accounted for 57% and 82% of the total lignin loss in the litterbag and tagged studies, respectively, based on normalization to syringyl-phenol concentrations. Comparison of these two data sets supports the following approximate lignin stability sequence for S. alterniflora: S congruent-to Ca congruent-to V > P much greater than Fa. Based on measured changes in both the lignin mass loss and the LOP acid/aldehyde ratio, as well as evidence suggesting that degradation occurred under oxic conditions, it is proposed that aromatic ring cleavage was the predominant mechanism of lignin degradation in both studies.In light of these results and those from other recent lignin degradation studies, we discuss the geochemical consequences regarding the usefulness of lignin oxidation products as quantitative tracers of vascular plant-derived organic matter being transported, deposited, and buried in aquatic environments.

CP  - 13th International Estuarine Biogeochemistry Symposium (IEBS) on Estuaries and Bays under Anthropogenic Pressure - Past-Present-Future
CL  - Bordeaux, FRANCE
AB  - Platinum is one of the least abundant elements in the earth crust with an average concentration of 0.51 ng g(-1), but its use in several human activities (mainly automobile catalytic converters) is leading its enrichment in surface sediments. Whereas, previous studies have assessed the Pt behavior in soils from urban areas, natural systems are still poorly studied.Accordingly, this study is aimed to characterize the behavior of the Pt released to coastal environments in sediments, ascertain the role of vegetation on the biogeochemistry of this element and assess the transference of Pt into the biological compartments. Several sediment cores were sampled in salt marshes (in unvegetated and vegetated areas) of the Tagus Estuary under different traffic pressure. Platinum concentration was analyzed in solid sediment, interstitial water and roots, leaves and stems of Sarcocomia fruticosa, a typical plant in south European salt marshes. In addition, interpretative parameters (e.g. redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, total reduced sulfur species, salinity and dissolved Fe and Mn in interstitial waters) were determined to better understand the biogeochemical cycle of Pt in salt marsh sediments.Although surface enrichment of Pt exists in the sediments at Low Traffic Station (2.8 ng g(-1)), the highest enrichment was found at High Traffic Station where concentration was, in some cases, up to 40 ng g(-1), linked to traffic emissions. However, dissolved Pt in interstitial waters (from 0.14 to 0.70 ng L-1) did not show this superficial maximum. This dissimilarity points out the unreactivity of traffic-borne Pt and the dissolution/precipitation cycle of natural Pt linked to Mn and O-2 cycle, depending on the redox conditions, highly controlled by the vegetation. Platinum concentration in roots (0.9 +/- 0.6 ng g(-1)) is reflecting the Pt concentration in the interstitial waters in each moment, even though at the two peaks of dissolved Pt (up to 2.5 ng L-1) found at deeper layers, reflecting a low bioaccumulation. However, results pointed that a different Pt species (with different bioavailability) may exist in both stations. Besides, Pt mean value in stems and leaves (0.04 +/- 0.05 ng g(-1)) indicates a low translocation of Pt from the roots to aerial parts.Therefore, the role of vegetation is fundamental on the geochemical behavior of Pt in sediments, due to the control of the redox conditions by roots in the surrounding sediments (between the O-2 release and the organic matter degradation) and leading to Pt species of varying bioavailability.

M3  - Review
AB  - Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC. is a New World warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical zone, perennial subshrub that is an important species in hypersaline coastal sites. Also known as sea ox-eye, it tolerates salinities ranging from less than 20 ppt to 130 ppt. It occurs in substrates low in organic matter and deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nearly all reproduction is vegetative from an extensive rhizome system. Populations of this species recover quickly after coverage by wrack. Stands of B. frutescens often dominate the landward border of salt marshes.

TI  - Direct and indirect trophic effects of predator depletion on basal trophic levels
T2  - ECOLOGY

AB  - Human population growth and development have heavily degraded coastal ecosystems with cascading impacts across multiple trophic levels. Understanding both the direct and indirect trophic effects of human activities is important for coastal conservation. In New England, recreational overfishing has triggered a regional trophic cascade. Predator depletion releases the herbivorous purple marsh crab from consumer control and leads to overgrazing of marsh cordgrass and salt marsh die-off. The direct and indirect trophic effects of predator depletion on basal trophic levels, however, are not understood. Using observational and experimental data, we examined the hypotheses that (1) direct trophic effects of predator depletion decrease meiofaunal abundance by releasing deposit feeding fiddler crabs from consumer control, and/or (2) indirect trophic effects of predator depletion increase meiofaunal abundance by releasing blue carbon via the erosion of centuries of accreted marsh peat. Experimental deposit feeder removal led to 23% higher meiofaunal density at die-off than at healthy sites, while reciprocally transplanting sediment from die-off and healthy sites revealed that carbon-rich die-off sediment increased meiofauna density by over 164%: six times stronger than direct trophic effects. Recovering sites had both carbon-rich sediment and reduced deposit feeding leading to higher meiofauna densities than both die-off and healthy sites. This suggests that consequences of the trophic downgrading of coastal habitats can be driven by both direct and indirect trophic mechanisms that may vary in direction and magnitude, making their elucidation dependent on experimental manipulations.

TI  - Elucidating carbon sources driving microbial metabolism during oil sands reclamation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial communities play key roles in remediation and reclamation of contaminated environments via biogeochemical cycling of organic and inorganic components. Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

AB  - Analysis of thirty-eight samples collected in the Carreras subsystem delimited three sectors: a) The Carreras Channel, with medium and fine sands transported in saltation, low organic matter and high hydrodynamics. The foraminiferal association is dominated by porcellaneous forms, such as Q. oblonga, Q. seminulum or Triloculina oblonga, and some marine forms introduced in suspension; b) the inner channels and channel borders, with sandy-silty-muddy sediments, abundant organic matter and low-moderate hydrodynamics. The most abundant species are Ammonia inflata, Astrononion stelligerum, Elphidium williamsoni and Haynesina germanica and c) the salt marsh, with muddy sediments and very abundant organic matter. The population of this protists is almost exclusively composed by Jadammina macrescens and Trochammina inflata.

TI  - Relative Stability of Plant Communities in a South Carolina High Salt Marsh
T2  - CASTANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - The high marsh in southeast Atlantic coast salt marshes forms a relatively small but ecologically important transition zone between low marsh and the terrestrial shoreline. However, long-term trend data from high marshes are limited to a few studies. Permanent plots established in a high marsh near Waties Island in northeast South Carolina were measured for plant coverage from 2002-2010. At the beginning and at the end of the study, four groups of plots were identified: mixed indicated by Borrichia frutescens, Distichlis spicata, and Fimbristylis castanea; Juncus indicated by Juncus roemerianus; Salicornia indicated by Salicornia virginica; and Spartina indicated by Spartina patens. Ordination of the 2010 plot data and soil analyses produced clear separation of the groups along a single dominant axis with Salicornia and Juncus groups at the high end of a salinity gradient and the Spartina group at the high end of soil organic matter gradient. Comparison of plots classified in 2002 to the same plots in 2010 suggested both stability and change, depending on community classification. Salicornia and Spartina groups were stable. The mixed group experienced a switch in dominance from Distichlis spicata to Borrichia frutescens, whereas the Juncus group had gradually declining importance of Juncus roemerianus and gradually increasing importance of Borrichia frutescens. These data represent patterns and trends in a system and time period not affected by development or influenced by high intensity disturbance, and can be used as a reference for other high marshes in the immediate area experiencing environmental change.
