TI  - Seagrass ecosystems as a globally significant carbon stock
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection of organic carbon stored in forests is considered as an important method for mitigating climate change. Like terrestrial ecosystems, coastal ecosystems store large amounts of carbon, and there are initiatives to protect these 'blue carbon' stores. Organic carbon stocks in tidal salt marshes and mangroves have been estimated, but uncertainties in the stores of seagrass meadows-some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth-hinder the application of marine carbon conservation schemes. Here, we compile published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass biomass and underlying soils in 946 distinct seagrass meadows across the globe. Using only data from sites for which full inventories exist, we estimate that, globally, seagrass ecosystems could store as much as 19.9 Pg organic carbon; according to a more conservative approach, in which we incorporate more data from surface soils and depth-dependent declines in soil carbon stocks, we estimate that the seagrass carbon pool lies between 4.2 and 8.4 Pg carbon. We estimate that present rates of seagrass loss could result in the release of up to 299 Tg carbon per year, assuming that all of the organic carbon in seagrass biomass and the top metre of soils is remineralized.

TI  - Sea Level-Driven Marsh Migration Results in Rapid Net Loss of Carbon
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise alters coastal carbon cycling by driving the rapid migration of coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater systems, and replacement of terrestrial forests with tidal wetlands. Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.

TI  - Deposition and burial of organic carbon in coastal salt marsh: Research progress
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh has higher potential of carbon sequestration, playing an important role in mitigating global warming, while coastal saline soil is the largest organic carbon pool in the coastal salt marsh carbon budget. To study the carbon deposition and burial in this soil is of significance for clearly understanding the carbon budget of coastal salt marsh. This paper summarized the research progress on the deposition and burial of organic carbon in coastal salt marsh from the aspects of the sources of coastal salt marsh soil organic carbon, soil organic carbon storage and deposition rate, burial mechanisms of soil organic carbon, and the relationships between the carbon sequestration in coastal salt marsh and the global climate change. Some suggestions for the future related researches were put forward: 1) to further study the underlying factors that control the variability of carbon storage in coastal salt marsh, 2) to standardize the methods for measuring the carbon storage and the deposition and burial rates of organic carbon in coastal salt marsh, 3) to quantify the lateral exchange of carbon flux between coastal salt marsh and adjacent ecosystems under the effects of tide, and 4) to approach whether the effects of global warming and the increased productivity could compensate for the increase of the organic carbon decomposition rate resulted from sediment respiration. To make clear the driving factors determining the variability of carbon sequestration rate and how the organic carbon storage is affected by climate change and anthropogenic activities would be helpful to improve the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal salt marshes in China.

TI  - Carbon in the Coastal Seascape: How Interactions Between Mangrove Forests, Seagrass Meadows and Tidal Marshes Influence Carbon Storage
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review We use the 'seascape' concept to explore how interactions between mangrove forests, tidal marshes and seagrass influence the storage of carbon in these ecosystems. Mangrove forests, with the other two 'blue carbon' habitats, are exceptionally powerful carbon sinks. Maintaining and enhancing these sinks is an emerging priority in climate change mitigation. However, managing any one ecosystem on its own risks is ignoring important contextual drivers of carbon storage emerging from its place in the seascape. We consider how interactions between these coastal habitats directly or indirectly affect the amounts of carbon they can store.Recent Findings The export of carbon from seagrasses may occur over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, much further than reported for mangroves or tidal marshes. Seagrasses may buffer mangroves from wave impacts, assisting forest regeneration. Trophic cascades supported by contiguous blue carbon habitat may limit excessive herbivory and bioturbation in them but evidence is limited.Summary Direct transfers of carbon between blue carbon habitats are common and are likely to enhance total carbon storage, but our understanding of their contribution to carbon stocks at the seascape level is elementary. There is evidence for indirect enhancement of carbon storage at the seascape by close association of habitats, mostly through the creation and maintenance of propitious conditions by one ecosystem for another. Protection from waves of mangroves by seagrass and protection from excess nutrients and sediment of seagrass by mangroves and tidal marsh are key mechanisms. There is little evidence or theory suggesting negative effects on carbon storage of one blue carbon habitat on another.

TI  - Carbon fluxes and stocks in a carbonate-rich chenier plain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they have high ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration capability. Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Large-scale predictions of salt-marsh carbon stock based on simple observations of plant community and soil type
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stored in coastal wetland ecosystems is of global relevance to climate regulation. Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44% of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32% of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37% of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44% of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (similar to 4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

TI  - Carbon accumulation in Bay of Fundy salt marshes: Implications for restoration of reclaimed marshes
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation of agricultural land to natural terrestrial vegetation has been suggested as a means to increase soil carbon storage. However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been "reclaimed," that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.

TI  - National scale predictions of contemporary and future blue carbon storage
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (+/- 65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Organic carbon stored in coastal wetlands, which comprises the major part of oceanic "blue carbon," is a subject of growing interest and concern. In this study, organic carbon storage in coastal wetlands and its economic value were estimated using the raw data of 25 studies related to soil carbon storage. Data were collected from three tidal flats (one protected and two developed areas) and two estuarine salt marshes (one protected and one restored area). Bulk density, soil organic matter content, and standing biomass of vegetation were all considered, with Monte Carlo simulation applied to estimate the uncertainty.Results: Mean carbon storage in two salt marshes ranged between 14.6 and 25.5 kg C m(-2). Mean carbon storage in tidal flats ranged from 18.2 to 28.6 kg C m(-2), with variability possibly related to soil texture. The economic value of stored carbon was estimated by comparison with the price of carbon in the emission trading market. The value of US $6600 ha(-1) is similar to 45% of previously estimated ecosystem services from fishery production and water purification functions in coastal areas.Conclusions: Although our study sites do not cover all types of large marine ecosystem, this study highlights the substantial contribution of coastal wetlands as carbon sinks and the importance of conserving these habitats to maximize their ecosystem services.

AB  - Global warming is anticipated to have a significant impact on high-latitude ecosystems which store large amounts of C in their soils and have a predominance of permafrost. The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.

TI  - The Invasion of Spartina alterniflora Alters Carbon Dynamics in China's Yancheng Natural Reserve
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem processes are tightly linked to the structure and functioning of plant communities. Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes. Our study indicates that instead of CO2 being simply incorporated into PCS and SCS, carbon dynamics following Spartina invasion are more complicated. Detailed studies of CH4 emissions are needed before ascertaining whether, and to what degree, the invasion of S. alterniflora may affect the global warming process.

TI  - Improved estimates on global carbon stock and carbon pools in tidal wetlands
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are global hotspots of carbon storage but errors exist with current estimates on their carbon density due to the use of factors estimated from other habitats for converting loss-on-ignition (LOI) to organic carbon (OC); and the omission of certain significant carbon pools. Here we show that the widely used conversion factor (LOI/OC = 1.724) is significantly lower than our measurements for saltmarsh sediments (1.92 +/- 0.01) and oversimplifies the polynomial relationship between sediment OC and LOI for mangrove forests. Global mangrove OC stock in the top-meter sediment reaches 1.93 Pg when corrected for this bias, and is 20% lower than the previous estimates. Ecosystem carbon stock (living and dead biomass, sediment OC and inorganic carbon) is estimated at 3.7-6.2 Pg. Mangrove deforestation leads to carbon emission rates at 23.5-38.7 Tg yr(-1) after 2000. Mangrove sediment OC stock has previously been over-estimated while ecosystem carbon stock underestimated.

TI  - A physical-biogeochemical mechanism for negative feedback between marsh crabs and carbon storage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are valuable global carbon sinks, yet large uncertainties in coastal marsh carbon budgets and mediating mechanisms limit our ability to estimate fluxes and predict feedbacks with global change. To improve mechanistic understanding, we assess how net carbon storage is influenced by interactions between crab activity, water movement, and biogeochemistry. We show that crab burrows enhance carbon loss from tidal marsh sediments by physical and chemical feedback processes. Burrows increase near-creek sediment permeability in the summer by an order of magnitude compared to the winter crab dormancy period, promoting carbon-rich fluid exchange between the marsh and creek. Burrows also enhance vertical exchange by increasing the depth of the strongly carbon-oxidizing zone and reducing the capacity for carbon sequestration. Results reveal the mechanism through which crab burrows mediate the movement of carbon through tidal wetlands and highlight the importance of considering burrowing activity when making budget projections across temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - By the methods of field survey and laboratory analysis, an investigation was conducted on the seasonal dynamics of biomass and carbon storage of Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora dominated vegetation belts in the Jiuduan Shoal Wetland of Yangtze Estuary, East China in 2010-2012. The organic carbon storage of the biomass (including aboveground part, underground part, and standing litter) of the two plants was the highest in autumn and the lowest in spring. The average carbon storage of the biomass of S. alterniflora per unit area (445.81 g x m(-2)) was much higher than that of P. australis (285.52 g x m(-2)), and the average carbon storage of the standing litter of S. alterniflora (315.28 g x m(-2)) was also higher than that of P. australia (203.15 g x m(-2)). However, the organic carbon storage in the surface soil (0-30 cm) under P. australis community (1048.62 g x m(-2)) was almost as twice times as that under S. alterniflora community (583.33 g x m(-2)). Overall, the carbon accumulation ability of P. australis community (3212.96 g x m(-2)) was stronger than that of the S. alterniflora community (2730.42 g x m(-2)). Therefore, it is of significance to protect the P. australis community in terms of carbon sequestration at the salt marsh.

AB  - Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Phragmites australis and Spartina afterniflora in Jiuduan Shoal Wetland of Yangtze Estuary, East China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - By the methods of field survey and laboratory analysis, an investigation was conducted on the seasonal dynamics of biomass and carbon storage of Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora dominated vegetation belts in the Jiuduan Shoal Wetland of Yangtze Estuary, East China in 2010-2012. The organic carbon storage of the biomass (including aboveground part, underground part, and standing litter) of the two plants was the highest in autumn and the lowest in spring. The average carbon storage of the biomass of S. alterniflora per unit area (445.81 g . m(-2)) was much higher than that of P. australis (285.52 g . m(-2)), and the average carbon storage of the standing litter of S. alterniflora (315.28 g . m(-2)) was also higher than that of P. australis (203.15 g . m(-2)). However, the organic carbon storage in the surface soil (0-30 cm) under P. australis community (1048.62 g . m(-2)) was almost as twice times as that under S. alterniflora community (583.33 g . m(-2)). Overall, the carbon accumulation ability of P. australis community (3212.96 g . m(-2)) was stronger than that of the S. alterniflora community (2730.42 g . m(-2)). Therefore, it is of significance to protect the P. australis community in terms of carbon sequestration at the salt marsh.

TI  - Temperate coastal wetland near-surface carbon storage: Spatial patterns and variability
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous, nevertheless are commonly described on the basis of vegetation distribution within the intertidal zone. Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.

TI  - System-Specific Complex Interactions Shape Soil Organic Carbon Distribution in Coastal Salt Marshes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide many critical ecosystem services including carbon storage. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most important component of carbon stock in coastal salt marshes. However, there are large uncertainties when estimating SOC stock in coastal salt marshes at large spatial scales. So far, information on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and determinants remains limited. Moreover, the role of complex ecological interactions in shaping SOC distribution is poorly understood. Here, we report detailed field surveys on plant, soil and crab burrowing activities in two inter-tidal salt marsh sites with similar habitat conditions in Eastern China. Our between-site comparison revealed slight differences in SOC storage and a similar vertical SOC distribution pattern across soil depths of 0-60 cm. Between the two study sites, we found substantially different effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC distribution. Complex interactions involving indirect effects between soil, plants and macrobenthos (crabs) may influence SOC distribution at a landscape scale. Marked differences in the SOC determinants between the study sites indicate that the underlying driving mechanisms of SOC distribution are strongly system-specific. Future work taking into account complex interactions and spatial heterogeneity is needed for better estimating of blue carbon stock and dynamics.

TI  - Assessing coastal carbon variability in two Delaware tidal marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the ability to sequester and store carbon. Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance's National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this 'blue carbon' storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.

TI  - Carbon Storage Increases with Site Age as Created Salt Marshes Transition to Mangrove Forests in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA)
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands can sequester large amounts of organic carbon (OC), providing an additional motivation for the preservation and restoration of these ecosystems. In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence. This study has demonstrated that carbon storage in created coastal wetlands is correlated to wetland age, indicating that these ecosystems have the potential to become significant sources of OC storage.

TI  - Spatial variation of above-ground carbon storage in temperate coastal wetlands
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous. The scale of assessment at which above-ground biomass is measured will directly influence carbon storage estimates. Greater confidence in estimates is obtained with approaches that describe more variation. There is a need to improve accuracy while optimising assessment effort efficiency. Accurate quantification of carbon storage is dependent upon accurate assessment of biomass, carbon content and the extent of vegetation for which carbon storage is being assessed. This study demonstrates that vegetation structure influences above-ground biomass of mangrove and saltmarsh, resulting in considerable variability in biomass estimates and associated carbon storage of temperate coastal wetlands in southeast Australia. For mangrove, variability in above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1) SE) was best described by measuring height, stem diameter, crown area and vegetation density, whereby tall mangrove (3-8 m in height; 71.50 +/- 12.53 Mg ha(-1)) had higher biomass than both shrub (1.3-3 m in height; 53.06 +/- 6.94 Mg ha(-1)) and dwarf mangrove (< 1.3 m in height; 10.68 +/- 1.77 Mg ha(-1)). Saltmarsh aboveground biomass was best described by height, species and vegetation density, which demonstrated significant differences between rush saltmarsh (15.97 +/- 2.35 Mg ha(-1)) and herbs, grasses and sedges saltmarsh (7.51 0.91 Mg ha '). The effect of this variation was compounded by carbon content (% C), which varied markedly between vegetation structural form and species (30.9-49.8% C). Maintaining accuracy when assessing carbon storage requires mapping units that correspond to the scale of biomass assessments. Results from this study suggest that recognition of variation in biomass and carbon content of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation structure will enhance the accuracy of estimates of carbon storage, and provide the confidence necessary for carbon storage inventories.

TI  - Ecosystem engineering by large grazers enhances carbon stocks in a tidal salt marsh
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazers can have a large impact on ecosystem processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.

TI  - Gulf of Mexico estuarine blue carbon stock, extent and flux: Mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses: A North American hotspot
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico blue carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes) form an important North American blue carbon hot spot. These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km(2) to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha. Constraints on the partial estuarine fluxes given for this new data are discussed as well as widespread anthropogenic destruction of the GoM blue carbon. A new North American comparison of our GoM blue carbon stocks versus Atlantic coastal blue carbon stock estimates is presented. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sediment Carbon Accumulation in Southern Latitude Saltmarsh Communities of Tasmania, Australia
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon sequestration values of wetlands are greatest in their sediments. Northern hemisphere research dominates the earlier saltmarsh carbon sequestration literature, recently augmented by analyses across mainland Australia where species assemblages, catchment histories and environmental settings differ. No previous assessment has been made for Tasmania. Carbon stores and accumulation rates in saltmarsh sediments of the Rubicon estuary, Tasmania, were investigated. Carbon was determined from sediment cores by Elemental Analyser, combined with analysis of organic content and bulk density. Carbon accumulation was determined using short-term and long-term sediment accretion indicators. Results showed carbon densities to be lower than global averages, with variation found between carbon stores of native and introduced species zones. Cores from introduced Spartina anglica indicated a trend of higher sediment carbon percentages relative to cores from native saltmarsh Juncus kraussii and Sarcocornia quinqueflora, and in finer grain sizes. Sediment carbon stock of 30 cm depths was 49.5 Mg C ha(-1) for native saltmarsh and 55.5 Mg C ha(-1) for Spartina. Carbon percentages were low owing to high catchment inorganic sediment yields, however carbon accumulation rates were similar to global averages, particularly under Spartina. Covering 85% of saltmarsh area in the estuary, Spartina contributes the majority to carbon stores, potentially indicating a previously unrecognized value for this invasive species in Australia.

TI  - Distribution of soil carbon storage in different saltmarsh plant communities in Chongming Dongtan wetland
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The high productivity of saltmarsh vegetation in coastal wetlands plays an important role on the formation of soil carbon pool. This paper studied the biomass difference, the spatiotemporal dynamics and vertical distribution of soil carbon storage in three dominant saltmarsh plant communities, i. e., Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter in the Chongming Dongtan wetland, in the Yangtze Estuary. The results indicated that the gross biomass in the three saltmarsh plant communities was in the order of S. alterniflora (5750.7 g . m(-2)) > P. australis (4655.1 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter (812.7 g . m(-2)). The aboveground biomass was the highest in summer, and autumn, and the underground biomass was the highest in winter. The soil carbon storage (0-50 cm) was the lowest in spring, gradually increased, and was the highest in winter. The annual increment of soil carbon storage decreased from the high tidal zone to the low tidal zone, and was in the order of P. australis community (711.8 g . m(-2)) > S. alterniflora community (646.2 g . m(-2)) > S. mariqueter community (185.3 g . m(-2)) > bare mudflat (65.6 g . m(-2)). The highest value was in the 25-30 cm, 10-15 cm, 30-35 cm and 30-40 cm soil layers for bare mudflat and the S. mariqueter, S. alterniflora and P. australis communities, respectively. There was a significant linear relationship between the soil carbon storage and the underground biomass in the different saltmarsh communities.

TI  - Variability in blue carbon storage related to biogeochemical factors in seagrass meadows off the coast of the Korean peninsula
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems, play an important role in climate change mitigation by an effective CO2 capture from atmosphere and water columns and long-term organic carbon (Corg) storage in sediments. Although seagrass meadows are considered intense carbon sinks, information on regional variability in seagrass blue carbon stock and factors influencing its capacity still remain sparse. In the present study, seagrass blue carbon storage by measuring Corg stocks in sediments and living seagrass biomass, and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in seagrass meadows were estimated along the Korean coast. Factors affecting variability in Corg stocks were also analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression and principal component analysis (PCA). Projected Corg stocks in sediment, extrapolated to a depth 1 m, exhibited substantial variability among sites, ranging from 49.91 to 125.71 Mg C ha-1. The majority of Corg (96-99%) was stored in sediments, whereas the contribution of living biomass was minor. PLS regression and PCA indicated that Corg stocks in seagrass meadows are strongly associated with sediment characteristics such as dry bulk density and water and mud content. Among seagrass traits, above- to below-ground biomass ratio was significantly related to the quantity of Corg stocks in seagrass meadows. Because of the high spatial variability in Corg stocks and CARs, local and regional differences in seagrass blue carbon storage should be considered to accurately assess the climate change mitigation potential of seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying blue carbon for the largest salt marsh in southern British Columbia: implications for regional coastal management
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding blue carbon storage and accumulation prior to engineering projects is essential for assessing the potential co-benefit of carbon storage for natural climate solutions. This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment. We outline subsequent research needed for salt marshes such as Boundary Bay to be included in voluntary carbon markets in British Columbia.

TI  - Seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh sedimentary carbon stocks in an urban estuary; Coffs Harbour, Australia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetation (seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh) termed "blue carbon'' systems have recently been noted for their potentially large carbon storage capacities. This study quantifies sedimentary blue carbon stocks in an urban estuary containing seagrass (Zostera muelleri), mangrove (Avicennia marina), and saltmarsh (Sporobolus virginicus) habitats in the Coffs Creek Estuary (NSW, Australia). The objective of this study is to investigate the carbon storage dynamics, including the evaluation of potential influences from the plant cover and geomorphology. The sediment carbon stock results presented in this work show that mangroves store more carbon, 1070 +/- 827 compared to 858 +/- 190 and 365 +/- 255 Mg ha(-1) than saltmarsh and seagrass, respectively. These results are of interest because in Coffs Creek alone, mangroves have expanded (in area) by more than 25% from 1986 to 2011. The large sediment carbon stocks found in this urban system emphasize the benefits of restoring and protecting these ecosystems as a way of offsetting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

TI  - Soil Carbon Stocks Vary Across Geomorphic Settings in Australian Temperate Tidal Marsh Ecosystems
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes rank among the ecosystems with the highest capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (C-org) on earth. To inform conservation of coastal vegetated ecosystems for climate change mitigation, this study investigated the factors driving variability in carbon storage. We estimated soil C(org)stocks in tidal marshes across temperate Western Australia and assessed differences among geomorphic settings (marine and fluvial deltas, and mid-estuary) and vegetation type (Sarcocornia quinquefloraandJuncus kraussii) linked to soil biogeochemistry. Soil C(org)stocks within fluvial and mid-estuary settings were significantly higher (209 +/- 14 and 211 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively; 1-m-thick soils) than in marine counterparts (156 +/- 12 Mg C-org ha(-1)), which can be partially explained by higher preservation of soil C(org)in fluvial and mid-estuary settings rich in fine-grained (< 0.063 mm) sediments (49 +/- 3% and 47 +/- 4%, respectively) compared to marine settings (23 +/- 4%). Soil C(org)stocks were not significantly different betweenS. quinquefloraandJ. kraussiimarshes (185 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 13 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively). The higher contribution of tidal marsh plus supratidal vegetation in fluvial (80%) and intermediate (76%) compared to marine (57%) settings further explains differences in soil C(org)stocks. The estimated soil C(org)stocks in temperate Western Australia's tidal marshes (57 Tg C(org)within similar to 3000 km(2)extent) correspond to about 2% of worldwide tidal marsh soil C(org)stocks. The results obtained identify global drivers of soil C(org)storage in tidal marshes and can be used to target hot spots for climate change mitigation based on tidal marsh conservation.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions could reduce the blue carbon value of marshes on eutrophic estuaries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The supply of nitrogen to ecosystems has surpassed the Earth's Planetary Boundary and its input to the marine environment has caused estuarine waters to become eutrophic. Excessive supply of nitrogen to salt marshes has been associated with shifts in species' distribution and production, as well as marsh degradation and loss. Our study of salt marshes in agriculturally intensive watersheds shows that coastal eutrophication can have an additional impact. We measured gas fluxes from marsh soils and verified emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) in nitrogen-loaded marshes while the reference marsh was a sink for this gas. Salt marsh soils are extremely efficient carbon sinks, but emissions of N2O, a greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than CO2, reduces the value of the carbon sink, and in some marshes, may counterbalance any value of stored carbon towards mitigation of climate change. Although more research is merited on the nitrogen transformations and carbon storage in eutrophic marshes, the possibility of significant N2O emissions should be considered when evaluating the market value of carbon in salt marshes subject to high levels of nitrogen loading.

TI  - Quantifying blue carbon and nitrogen stocks in surface soils of temperate coastal wetlands
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are carbon and nutrient sinks that capture large amounts of atmospheric CO2 and runoff of nutrients. 'Blue carbon' refers to carbon stored within resident vegetation (e.g. mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) and soil of coastal wetlands. This study aimed to quantify the impact of vegetation type on soil carbon stocks (organic and inorganic) and nitrogen in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of mangroves and tidal marsh habitats within nine temperate coastal blue carbon wetlands in South Australia. Results showed differences in surface soil organic carbon stocks (18.4 Mg OC ha(-1) for mangroves; 17.6 Mg OC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), inorganic carbon (31.9 Mg IC ha(-1) for mangroves; 35.1 Mg IC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), and total nitrogen (1.8 Mg TN ha(-1) for both) were not consistently driven by vegetation type. However, mangrove soils at two sites (Clinton and Port Augusta) and tidal marsh soils at one site (Torrens Island) had larger soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. These results highlighted site-specific differences in blue carbon stocks between the vegetation types and spatial variability within sites. Further, differences in spatial distribution of SOC within sites corresponded with variations in soil bulk density (BD). Results highlighted a link between SOC and BD in blue carbon soils. Understanding the drivers of carbon and nitrogen storage across different blue carbon environments and capturing its spatial variability will help improve predictions of the contribution these ecosystems to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Will coastal wetlands continue to sequester carbon in response to an increase in global sea level?: a case study of the rapidly subsiding Mississippi river deltaic plain
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The highly visible coastal phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) was examined through the prism of carbon accumulation and loss. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestration in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes. Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon. These results may serve as a predictor of the impact of future predictions of increasing global sea level rise on carbon sequestration for other coastal regions.

TI  - Blue Carbon Soil Stock Development and Estimates Within Northern Florida Wetlands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, have been recognized as carbon burial hotspots; however, methods on measuring blue carbon stocks have varied and thus leave uncertainty in global blue carbon stock estimates. This study analyzes blue carbon stocks in northern Florida wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Carbon measurements within 1-3m length vibracores yield total core stocks of 9.9-21.5 kgC center dot m(-2) and 7.7-10.9 kgC center dot m(-2) for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates in the top meter are 7.0 kgC center dot m(-2)-8.0 kgC center dot m(-2) and 6.1 kgC center dot m(-2)-8.6 kgC center dot m(-2) for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta C-13, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following relative sea-level rise. These transgressions impact carbon storage within the cores as the presence of carbon-poor soils, characteristic of non-blue carbon habitats, result in lower 1m carbon stocks in north Florida Gulf wetlands, and a deeper extent of carbon-rich soils, characteristic of blue carbon habitats, drive higher 1m and total carbon stocks in north Florida Atlantic wetlands. Future blue carbon research should assess carbon stocks down to bedrock when possible, as land-cover and/or climate change can impact different depths across localities. Ignoring carbon-rich soil below the top meter of soil may underestimate potential carbon emissions based on these changes.

TI  - Surface evolution and carbon sequestration in disturbed and undisturbed wetland soils of the Hunter estuary, southeast Australia
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the soil carbon storage and sequestration rates of undisturbed natural wetlands and disturbed wetlands subject to restriction of tidal flow and subsequent rehabilitation in an Australian estuary. Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15% for mangrove and 55% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65% for mangrove and 60% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95% for mangrove and 345% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

TI  - Feral hog disturbance alters carbon dynamics in southeastern US salt marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances that remove primary producers and alter substrate chemistry commonly influence ecosystem carbon dynamics. Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.

TI  - Operationalizing Blue Carbon in the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, Texas
T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, greater interest in the resilience of coastal habitat ecosystem services in the northern Gulf of Mexico has emerged due in part to an expansion of mangroves into areas previously dominated by salt marshes. To operationalize coastal wetland ecosystem services for decision-making, there is a need to clarify how salt marshes and mangroves function in this region. The goal of this research is to operationalize blue carbon (carbon stored in coastal habitats) within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, TX by documenting what we know about blue carbon within the study area, identifying data gaps and future research needs, and using available knowledge to inform management and decision-making within the Reserve. Our research shows that there is a lack of data within the Reserve on mangrove aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and soil carbon and on salt marsh soil carbon. There is also a dearth of information on wetland carbon sequestration and emission rates within the Reserve, making it challenging to inform management and develop a market for blue carbon.

TI  - Coastal Blue Carbon Assessment of Mangroves, Salt Marshes, and Salt Barrens in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal "blue carbon" habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

TI  - Expression, Purification, and Characterization of a Well-Adapted Tyrosinase from Peatlands Identified by Partial Community Analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In peatlands, bacterial tyrosinases (TYRs) are proposed to act as key regulators of carbon storage by removing phenolic compounds, which inhibit the degradation of organic carbon. Historically, TYR activity has been blocked by anoxia resulting from persistent waterlogging; however, recent events of prolonged summer drought have boosted TYR activity and, consequently, the release of carbon stored in the form of organic compounds from peatlands. Since 30% of the global soil carbon stock is stored in peatlands, a profound understanding of the production and activity of TYRs is essential to assess the impact of carbon dioxide emitted from peatlands on climate change. TYR partial sequences identified by degenerated primers suggest a versatile TYR enzyme community naturally present in peatlands, which is produced by a phylogenetically diverse spectrum of bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. One full-length sequence of an extracellular TYR (SzTYR) identified from a soda-rich inland salt marsh has been heterologously expressed and purified. SzTYR exhibits a molecular mass of 30 891.8 Da and shows a pH optimum of 9.0. Spectroscopic studies and kinetic investigations characterized SzTYR as a tyrosinase and proved its activity toward monophenols (coumaric acid), diphenols (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid), and triphenols (gallic acid) naturally present in peatlands.

TI  - Valuing the European 'coastal blue carbon' storage benefit
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Blue' carbon ecosystems are important carbon storage providers that are currently not protected by any international mechanism, such as REDD. This study aims to contribute to raising awareness in the political domain about the 'blue' carbon issue. This analysis also provides guidance in terms of how to value stock and flows of ecosystem services adding to the debate begun by the Costanza et al. (1997) paper in Nature. Through scenario analysis we assess how human welfare benefits will be affected by changes in the European coastal blue carbon stock provision. The current extent of European coastal blue carbon has an accounting stock value of about US$180 million. If EU Environmental Protection Directives continue to be implemented and effectively enforced, society will gain an appreciating asset over time. However, a future policy reversal resulting in extensive ecosystem loss could mean economic value losses as high as US$1 billion by 2060. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Plant size metrics and organic carbon content of Florida salt marsh vegetation
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stored in soil and vegetative biomass in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass flats ("coastal blue carbon") is a significant component of the coastal carbon budget due to the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as plant biomass and peat. Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2 +/- 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1 +/- 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4-47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3 +/- 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4 +/- 2.0% carbon. These species-specific equations and carbon data provide non-destructive methods to rapidly quantify vegetative biomass and carbon stocks for monitoring efforts and blue carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Estimating reclamation-induced carbon loss in coastal wetlands using time series GF-1 WVF data: A case study in the Yangtze Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF ECOSYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY XIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Coastal wetland is a net carbon sink with a high carbon density. However, coastal reclamation directly changes the structure of coastal wetland ecosystem and consequent carbon sink function. The aim of this work was to estimate the reclamation-induced carbon loss in coastal wetlands using time series GF-1 WVF data. For this purpose, GF-1 WVF imageries of 2013 (before reclamation) and 2017 (after reclamation) in the Yangtze Estuary were collected and analyzed combined with field monitoring. Results showed that the converted coastal wetland area occupied up to 61.60% between 2013 and 2017. Carbon estimation indicated that the coastal wetland before reclamation had greater potential contribution to the global warming mitigation than the wetland reclamation to other land cover types. Finally the vulnerability of carbon stores and uncertain analysis with remote sensing technology in coastal wetlands environment were discussed. We emphasized that long-term monitoring of coastal wetlands and its carbon dynamic are urgently needed, because so many uncertain factors exist in short-term monitoring.

TI  - What happens to soil organic carbon as coastal marsh ecosystems change in response to increasing salinity? An exploration using ramped pyrolysis
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Nitrate addition stimulates microbial decomposition of organic matter in salt marsh sediments
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes sequester carbon at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than their terrestrial counterparts, helping to mitigate climate change. As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

TI  - Coastal wetland response to sea level rise in Connecticut and New York
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistence of salt marshes in the landscape depends on their ability to accommodate rising sea level and minimize additional flooding stress. We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0 mm yr(-1) circa 1900 to 3.6 mm yr(-1) at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1), increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Response of a salt marsh plant to sediment deposition disturbance
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes (a type of coastal wetland with herbaceous plants) are one of the most productive ecosystems. The organic matter accumulated by plants, together with deposition of inorganic mineral sediments, contributes to vertical marsh growth and determines the marsh ability to cope with regional sea level rise. Deposition of mineral sediment, in turn, alters the growth of plant roots and shoots, and further marsh morphology and blue carbon storage. Based on mesocosm experiments simulating the sedimentation intensity, this paper examined the responses of Spartina alterniflora (a plant widely distributed in global salt marshes) to sediment deposition events (0-24 cm thicknesses). The plant height increased by 1.51 cm on average with 1 cm sediment deposition. New roots grew into the deposited sediment layers, resulting in a significant increase in the below-ground biomass. The below-ground biomass doubled with the treatment of 24 cm deposition thickness in comparison with that without deposition. The depth-dependent distribution of below-ground biomass changed from a monotonous (decreasing with soil depth) to a non-monotonic (increasing first and then decreasing) trend. This illustrates the growth of marsh plants in response to sediment deposition disturbance (similar to artificial or storm-induced sediment deposition) and have important implications for further investigations on marsh resiliency, blue carbon storage and marsh morphology.

TI  - Updated estimates of carbon accumulation rates in coastal marsh sediments
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on carbon stock in salt marsh sediments have increased since the review by Chmura et al. (2003). However, uncertainties exist in estimating global carbon storage in these vulnerable coastal habitats, thus hindering the assessment of their importance. Combining direct data and indirect estimation, this study compiled studies involving 143 sites across the Southern and Northern hemispheres, and provides an updated estimate of the global average carbon accumulation rate (CAR) at 244.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in salt marsh sediments. Based on region-specific CAR and estimates of salt marsh area in various geographic regions between 40 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N, total CAR in global salt marsh sediments is estimated at similar to 10.2 Tg C yr(-1). Latitude, tidal range and elevation appear to be important drivers for CAR of salt marsh sediments, with considerable variation among different biogeographic regions. The data indicate that while the capacity for carbon sequestration by salt marsh sediments ranked the first amongst coastal wetland and forested terrestrial ecosystems, their carbon budget was the smallest due to their limited and declining global areal extent. However, some uncertainties remain for our global estimate owing to limited data availability.

AB  - Wetland soils are globally important carbon stores, and natural wetlands provide a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through ongoing carbon accumulation. Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

TI  - Blue carbon in coastal landscapes: a spatial framework for assessment of stocks and additionality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to incorporate blue carbon, the carbon associated with marine ecosystems, into carbon accounting and carbon markets are increasing. To fully leverage the capacity of marine ecosystems to sequester carbon requires information to guide prioritisation of coastal landscapes for conservation and regeneration. A comprehensive landscape-scale assessment of mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon requires information regarding vegetation cover, sedimentological and geomorphological factors. This information should also be integrated with socio-economic factors that alter natural processes of blue carbon accumulation and storage. The purpose of this study was to provide a framework for undertaking a first-pass assessment of blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency in coastal landscapes, and to incorporate socio-economic factors that will influence blue carbon storage in coastal landscapes. This was achieved using readily available datasets that were analysed using a raster-based approach to develop a proxy indication of biophysical and socio-economic factors relevant for mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon. The approach demonstrated that large catchments were associated with areas highly suitable for blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency. Small catchments associated with mature barrier estuaries had the highest proportional area that provides potential blue carbon ecosystem services and climate mitigation benefits. The qualitative approach used does not replace high-resolution quantitative assessments of blue carbon storage, flux and detailed site-specific assessment of socio-economic factors that may influence blue carbon services; however, it can be used to guide prioritisation of blue carbon landscapes for further assessment prior to conservation and/or regeneration.

TI  - Substantial blue carbon in overlooked Australian kelp forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition of the potential for vegetated coastal ecosystems to store and sequester carbon has led to their increasing inclusion into global carbon budgets and carbon offset schemes. However, kelp forests have been overlooked in evaluations of this 'blue carbon', which have been limited to tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds. We determined the continental-scale contribution to blue carbon from kelp forests in Australia using areal extent, biomass, and productivity measures from across the entire Great Southern Reef. We reveal that these kelp forests represent 10.3-22.7 Tg C and contribute 1.3-2.8 Tg C year(-1) in sequestered production, amounting to more than 30% of total blue carbon stored and sequestered around the Australian continent, and similar to 3% of the total global blue carbon. We conclude that the omission of kelp forests from blue carbon assessments significantly underestimates the carbon storage and sequestration potential from vegetated coastal ecosystems globally.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Calculating the global contribution of coralline algae to total carbon burial
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is changing the global marine environment and is causing warming and acidification of the oceans. Reduction of CO2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a CO2 sink via photosynthesis and CaCO3 dissolution and act as a CO2 source during respiration and CaCO3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 900 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 x 10(9) t C yr(-1). Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae (CCA) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm ky r(-1). Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/CCA was 0.4/1.2 x 10(9) t C yr(-1) suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 x 10(9) tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantified but significant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.

TI  - Carbon export from fringing saltmarsh shoreline erosion overwhelms carbon storage across a critical width threshold
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are carbon storage hotspots and help to offset anthropogenic carbon emissions; however, marshes are threatened by sea-level rise, erosion, and human development. Recent efforts to constrain the saltmarsh carbon cycle have focused on the processes of carbon burial and sequestration with respect to sea-level rise and global warming. Simultaneously, many marshes that fringe the margins of estuaries and barrier islands are eroding, which releases old carbon from the saltmarsh and transports it into the estuary, and that process should be included in marsh carbon budgets. Additionally, if marshes cannot transgress the upland at a rate that balances shoreline retreat, then the marsh will narrow, thus reducing the area available for carbon storage. Here, we present the development of a box model that incorporates both carbon storage and carbon export via shoreline erosion to estimate the annual carbon budget of saltmarsh sediments. We test the model using field data collected at a fringing marsh within the Rachel Carson National Estuarine Research Reserve in North Carolina. The shoreline erosion rates along the fringing marsh are variable and the model output shows that the stretch of marsh that is retreating 0.76 m yr(-1) switched to a carbon source in 1930, while another portion of the marsh that is retreating more slowly (0.65 m yr(-1)) will switch to a source in 2021. The model indicates that the carbon budget of a saltmarsh is highly sensitive to the rate of shoreline retreat and that rapidly-eroding marshes may already be net sources of carbon. These results underscore the importance of conserving existing marshes, mitigating shoreline erosion, and considering shoreline erosion in the design of saltmarsh restoration projects.

TI  - Wetland carbon storage controlled by millennial-scale variation in relative sea-level rise
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass) sustain the highest rates of carbon sequestration per unit area of all natural systems(1,2), primarily because of their comparatively high productivity and preservation of organic carbon within sedimentary substrates(3). Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.

M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing interest in managing wetland restoration and conservation projects to maximize carbon sequestration. We measured soil organic carbon storage and methane flux from two southern California salt marshes which had been restored for 2 and 22 years. We hypothesized that organic carbon would accumulate following restoration and that methane flux would be negligible in both sites. While methane flux was minimal, soil organic carbon content was generally higher in the more recently restored site. Although there is a potential for carbon sequestration in salt marshes, tracking this process through time may be complicated by initial site conditions.

TI  - Communities and blue carbon: the role of traditional management systems in providing benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

TI  - Salt marsh ecosystem restructuring enhances elevation resilience and carbon storage during accelerating relative sea-level rise
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes respond to sea-level rise through a series of complex and dynamic bio-physical feedbacks. In this study, we found that sea-level rise triggered salt marsh habitat restructuring, with the associated vegetation changes enhancing salt marsh elevation resilience. A continuous record of marsh elevation relative to sea level that includes reconstruction of high-resolution, sub-decadal, marsh elevation over the past century, coupled with a lower-resolution 1500-year record, revealed that relative sea-level rose 1.5 +/- 0.4 m, following local glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm/yr). As sea-level rise has rapidly accelerated, the high marsh zone dropped 11 cm within the tidal frame since 1932, leading to greater inundation and a shift to flood- and salt-tolerant low marsh species. Once the marsh platform fell to the elevation favored by low-marsh Spartina alterniflara, the elevation stabilized relative to sea level. Currently low marsh accretion keeps pace with sea-level rise, while present day high marsh zones that have not transitioned to low marsh have a vertical accretion deficit. Greater biomass productivity, and an expanding subsurface accommodation space favorable for salt marsh organic matter preservation, provide a positive feed-back between sea-level rise and marsh platform elevation. Carbon storage was 46 +/- 28 g C/m(2)/yr from 550 to 1800 CE, increasing to 129 +/- 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the last decade. Enhanced carbon storage is controlled by vertical accretion rates, rather than soil carbon density, and is a direct response to anthropogenic eustatic sea-level rise, ultimately providing a negative feedback on climate warming.

TI  - Stability of organic carbon accumulating in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marshes of the Mid-Atlantic US
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic carbon sequestration in salt marsh soils is a function of factors that influence both spatial variability and chemical stability of accumulating carbon. Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

TI  - No Detectable Broad-Scale Effect of Livestock Grazing on Soil Blue-Carbon Stock in Salt Marshes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland carbon capturing and storage (CCS) is thought to benefit from regulation of grazing. The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh "blue carbon" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

TI  - Dry bulk density, loss on ignition and organic carbon content of surficial soils from Scottish salt marshes, 2018-2019
T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - The dataset comprises of biogeochemical measurements of saltmarsh soil collected from 46 salt marshes across Scotland. Sites were chosen to represent contrasting habitats across Scotland, in particular sediment types, vegetation and sea level history. The data provide a quantitative measure of the dry bulk density, soil texture, organic matter content (LOI) and organic carbon present within surface soils (up to a depth of 10 cm). A total of 471 samples were collected, 157 of the samples were collected using modified syringe samplers as part of the citizen scientist programme CarbonQuest (Part of C-SIDE) these were supplemented by a further 109 samples from the C-SIDE team. The remaining 205 samples were collected using a soil corer (Gouge) as part of the C-SIDE sampling programme. The samples were processed for bulk density, soil texture, organic matter content using the Loss on Ignition (LOI) method and the organic carbon was quantified through elemental analysis. The data were collected to help create a detailed picture of saltmarsh carbon storage across Scotland. The work was carried out under the NERC programme - Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environment (C-SIDE), NERC grant reference NE/R010846/1 Soil cores were taken at each sampling location using a modified syringe corer (50ml) or a soil corer (30mm Gouge). The location of the sample was recorded using GPS. Prior to analysis the samples were stored at -20 degrees Celsius at the University of St Andrews. Dry bulk density, soil texture, organic matter content and organic carbon data was produced using standard analytical procedures (detailed in the supporting documentation). All laboratory equipment were calibrated in accordance with the laboratory practises at the University of St Andrews. Results were recorded on to lab sheets and transferred into an Excel file. Results were exported as comma separated value (.csv) file for ingestion into the EIDC. Copyright: This resource is available under the terms of the Open Government Licence

TI  - Allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to carbon accumulation and carbon store in southeastern Australian coastal wetlands
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000 km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in delta C-13 was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.

TI  - table1_Blue Carbon Soil Stock Development and Estimates Within Northern Florida Wetlands.docx
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Blue carbon habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, have been recognized as carbon burial hotspots; however, methods on measuring blue carbon stocks have varied and thus leave uncertainty in global blue carbon stock estimates. This study analyzes blue carbon stocks in northern Florida wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Carbon measurements within 1-3m length vibracores yield total core stocks of 9.9-21.5 kgC·m2 and 7.7-10.9 kgC·m2 for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates in the top meter are 7.0 kgC·m2-8.0 kgC·m2 and 6.1 kgC·m2-8.6 kgC·m2 for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta13C, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following relative sea-level rise. These transgressions impact carbon storage within the cores as the presence of carbon-poor soils, characteristic of non-blue carbon habitats, result in lower 1m carbon stocks in north Florida Gulf wetlands, and a deeper extent of carbon-rich soils, characteristic of blue carbon habitats, drive higher 1m and total carbon stocks in north Florida Atlantic wetlands. Future blue carbon research should assess carbon stocks down to bedrock when possible, as land-cover and/or climate change can impact different depths across localities. Ignoring carbon-rich soil below the top meter of soil may underestimate potential carbon emissions based on these changes.

M3  - Review
AB  - The sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and ocean into coastal ecosystems such as seaweed beds, seagrasses, saltmarshes, and tidal flats is an important and emerging area of interest due to their valuable role in carbon storage and potential for moderating climate conditions. Here, we investigated how these ecosystems in Korea can serve as carbon sinks and estimated the amount of CO2 that might be removed through aquaculture beds, artificial reefs, and sea forests. We also examined the benefits of restoring degraded coastal ecosystems. In total, we estimated that the 0.38 x 10(6) ha covered by Korean coastal ecosystems could potentially lock up approximately 1.01 x 10(6) t of CO2.

TI  - Soil carbon may be maintained under grazing in a St Lawrence Estuary tidal marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Production of belowground organic matter is critical to sustainability of salt marshes. It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.

TI  - Placing barrier-island transgression in a blue-carbon context
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Backbarrier saltmarshes are considered carbon sinks; however, barrier island transgression and the associated processes of erosion and overwash are typically not included in coastal carbon budgets. Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source.

TI  - Restoring Coastal Plants to Improve Global Carbon Storage: Reaping What We Sow
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently considered a viable strategy for mitigating rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and associated impacts of global climate change. Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery.

TI  - Modeling organic carbon loss from a rapidly eroding freshwater coastal wetland
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline erosion can transition freshwater coastal wetlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources. No studies have explored the impacts of coastal geomorphic processes on freshwater wetland carbon budgets. To do so, we modified a saltmarsh carbon budget model for application in freshwater coastal wetlands. We validated the model with data from a shoreline wetland in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The model generates the carbon budget by differencing carbon export and carbon storage. The inputs for carbon storage are the carbon inventory and maximum wetland age. Inputs for carbon export include erosion rates and overwash extent. The model demonstrates that the wetland examined in this study transitioned to a source of carbon during periods of erosion. In fact, the net carbon export between 2015 and 2018 was 10% of the wetland's original carbon stock. This study indicates that geomorphic change can dictate whether and how freshwater coastal wetlands serve as sources or sinks for terrestrial carbon, and that carbon stocks can fluctuate on a geologically rapid timescale. We recommend that such geomorphic processes be considered when developing carbon budgets for these marginal environments. Furthermore, the carbon budget model refined in this study can be used to prioritize wetlands in land management and conservation efforts.

T2  - Environmental Data Initiative
M3  - Data set
AB  - In this dataset, we used a controlled flow-through reactor (FTR) experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

TI  - Salt marsh plants carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary illustrated by a stable isotopic analysis based approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The biomasses, carbon standing stocks, and exportations of three saltmarsh species - Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritima and Zostera noltii - were determined and their isotopic composition analyzed to illustrate their role in carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary (Mondego, Portugal). Biomass values were higher in the warmer seasons than in the cold seasons, with carbon contents following the same trend. Carbon content ranged from 27-39% in S. maritimus and S. maritima to 30-39% for Z. noltii. S. maritimus had the highest carbon production in the aboveground organs and had similar results with S. maritima in the belowground carbon production. These three species together occupied about 50% of the salt marsh area and they stored in 21 months of study 24,000 kg of carbon in their aboveground and belowground organs. Z. noltii presented highest carbon concentration in the sediment and S. maritimus the lowest. Stable carbon isotopic analysis showed that apparently, the sedimentary organic matter is composed by a mix of terrestrial sources, macro and microalgae. Regard the high carbon exportation, S. maritima and 1 noltii are constantly accumulating carbon. The studied species have both a sink and source behaviour simultaneously.

TI  - Accounting for black carbon lowers estimates of blue carbon storage services
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The canopies and roots of seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarsh protect a legacy of buried sedimentary organic carbon from resuspension and remineralisation. This legacy's value, in terms of mitigating anthropogenic emissions of CO2, is based on total organic carbon (TOC) inventories to a depth likely to be disturbed. However, failure to subtract allochthonous recalcitrant carbon overvalues the storage service. Simply put, burial of oxidation-resistant organics formed outside of the ecosystem provides no additional protection from remineralisation. Here, we assess whether black carbon (BC), an allochthonous and recalcitrant form of organic carbon, is contributing to a significant overestimation of blue carbon stocks. To test this supposition, BC and TOC contents were measured in different types of seagrass and mangrove sediment cores across tropical and temperate regimes, with different histories of air pollution and fire together with a reanalysis of published data from a subtropical system. The results suggest current carbon stock estimates are positively biased, particularly for low-organiccontent sandy seagrass environs, by 18 +/- 3% (+/- 95% confidence interval) and 43 +/- 21% (+/- 95% CI) for the temperate and tropical regions respectively. The higher BC fractions appear to originate from atmospheric deposition and substantially enrich the relatively low TOC fraction within these environs.

There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.

TI  - Effects of seasonality and environmental gradients on Spartina alterniflora allometry and primary production
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictions of how salt marsh primary production and carbon storage will respond to environmental change can be improved through detailed datasets documenting responses to real-world environmental variation. To address a shortage of detailed studies of natural variation, we examined drivers of Spartina alterniflora stem allometry and productivity in seven marshes across three regions in southern Louisiana. Live-stem allometry varied spatially and seasonally, generally with short stems weighing more (and tall stems weighing less) in the summer and fall, differences that persist even after correcting for flowering. Strong predictive relationships exist between allometry parameters representing emergent stem mass and mass accumulation rates, suggesting that S.alterniflora populations navigate a trade-off between larger mass at emergence and faster rates of biomass accumulation. Aboveground production and belowground production were calculated using five and four approaches, respectively. End-of-season aboveground biomass was a poor proxy for increment-based production measures. Aboveground production (Smalley) ranged from 390 to 3,350gm(-2)year(-1) across all marshes and years. Belowground production (max-min) was on average three times higher than aboveground; total production ranged from 1,400 to 8,500gm(-2)year(-1). Above- and belowground production were both positively correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations and negatively correlated to salinity. Synthesis: Interannual variation in water quality is sufficient to drive above- and belowground productivity. The positive relationship between nutrients and belowground production indicates that inputs of nutrients and freshwater may increase salt marsh carbon storage and ecosystem resilience to sea level rise.

TI  - Modeling of carbon sequestration in coastal marsh soils
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Two transects were established across submerging coastal landscapes in Dorchester County, Maryland. Extensive sampling protocol was performed along the submerging upland tidal marsh soils to model C sequestration. Coastal marsh soils are accreting vertically and migrating laterally over the low-lying forest soils to keep pace with sealevel rise. The predictive C sequestration model was a two-step linear function. Therefore, C sequestration will continue to occur by accumulation in the organic horizons and sea-level rise is the driving force. During the last 150 yr, the rate of C sequestration averaged 83.5 +/- 23 g m(-2) yr(-1). Before the last few hundred years, the predicted longterm rate of C sequestration averaged 29.2 +/- 5.35 g m(-2) yr(-1). Sampling protocol and model validation ascertain the validity of the model and placed 80% confidence and 10% accuracy on rates of C sequestration and the predictive model. The model indicated that coastal marsh soils have higher C storage capacity than upland forest soils, and soils in the Cumulic subgroup of Mollisols. In general, C storage in mineral soils tends to reach a steady-state condition, whereas C sequestration in coastal marsh soils is a continuous phenomenon. During the next century, future C sequestration in the newly formed coastal marsh soils averaged 400 +/- 162 g m(-2) yr(-1). Modeling C sequestration in coastal marsh ecosystems indicated that C storage under positive accretionary balance acts as a negative feedback mechanism to global warming.

TI  - Predators help protect carbon stocks in blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of 'blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

TI  - Salt marsh-mangrove ecotones: using structural gradients to investigate the effects of woody plant encroachment on plant-soil interactions and ecosystem carbon pools
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.

TI  - Impacts of Phragmites australis Invasion on Soil Enzyme Activities and Microbial Abundance of Tidal Marshes
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of Phragmites australis in brackish marshes of the East Coast of the USA has drawn much attention, because it may change vegetation diversity and ecosystem functions. In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.

T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - The dataset comprises of physical property and biogeochemical measurements of saltmarsh soil collected using the hammer coring technique from the Kyle of Tongue saltmarsh in the North of Scotland. The site was chosen to represent northern, loch head marshes and to test different coring techniques in organic rich soils. The data provides a quantitative measure of the dry bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon content present within the soils of the Kyle of Tongue saltmarsh. A total of 4 cores were collected, 39 samples were collected at 10cm intervals down the length of each core. The samples were processed for bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon content which was quantified through elemental analysis. The data were collected to help create a detailed picture of saltmarsh carbon storage in the soils of UK saltmarsh and test different coring approaches. The cores were collected by the data authors in November 2018. The work was carried out under the NERC programme - Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environment (C-SIDE), NERC grant reference NE/R010846/1 Soil cores were collected using the hammer coring technique, where a PVC pipe was manually driven into the soil. The location of the cores was recorded using DGPS. Prior to analysis, the cores were split, the soil profile described using the Troel-smith scheme and fixed volumetric (4cm3) samples collected at 10cm intervals down the length of each core. Dry bulk density, water content, porosity and organic carbon data was produced using standard analytical procedures (detailed in the supporting documentation). All laboratory equipment were calibrated in accordance with the laboratory practises at the University of St Andrews. Results were recorded on to lab sheets and transferred into an Excel file. Results were exported as comma separated value (.csv) files for ingestion into the EIDC. Copyright: This resource is available under the terms of the Open Government Licence

TI  - Salt Marsh: Ecologically Important, Yet Least Studied Blue Carbon Ecosystems in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are intertidal halophytic vegetations, distributed in mid to lower latitudes. They provide important ecosystem services, including transportation and remineralization of nutrients, habitat for coastal biota, coastal bioshield, biofilters and recreation and cultural benefits. In India, 15 salt marsh species so far have been reported, spread over 1600 km(2). Salt marshes are known to adapt themselves to the changing environmental conditions fairly quickly by maintaining a balance between the existing pressures and the prevailing state. Thus, they tend to retain a long-term ecosystem sustainability under changing environmental conditions. Recent studies have recognized them for their extraordinary capacity of carbon sequestration, which gives them edge amongst the coastal ecosystems, but the carbon stock is comparatively low due to their alarming decline in global areal extent.In the Indian context, salt marshes occupy a significant share of the coastline along with the other blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses. This provides India with a very promising alternative for achieving its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution towards climate change mitigation through enhancing additional carbon sinks (INDC goal # 5). But, despite its rich salt marsh diversity and distribution along the entire coastline, Indian salt marshes are one of the most overlooked coastal ecosystems. The documented studies on the Indian marshes are relatively scarce and studies addressing their carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential are totally non-existent. There is an urgent need for targeted scientific studies to be taken up on the Indian salt marsh ecosystems to develop a holistic and updated database, which can support resource management, decisionmaking and facilitate to estimate Blue carbon economy of India.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Coastal regions, at the interface between terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems, play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles. This chapter reviews the climate regulation services of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) including tidal salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, macroalgal forests, coral reefs, and coastal shelf ecosystems. ECEs regulate global and regional climates by sequestering or releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). ECEs are extremely productive biologically, with net primary production rates per unit area among the highest of any ecosystem. Consequently, ECEs play a globally significant role as carbon sinks, with carbon storage rates per unit area of many habitats far exceeding that of land habitats at the rate of about 10 times that of temperate terrestrial forests and 50 times that of tropical forests. Furthermore, sedimentation does not reach an equilibrium carbon balance as occurs in terrestrial systems, whose sequestration capacity is forecasted to decrease this century. Conversely, they are large potential sources of GHG's if disturbed or misman-aged. Critically, carbon sequestration in many coastal habitats is superior to that of terrestrial habitats, as carbon is generally stored over long time frames (thousands of years) as a consequence of the large belowground biomass and the absence of fire threat. Furthermore, carbon is generally broken down anaerobically; hence, emissions of other potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide are negligible. A review of literature provided sequestration rates for various coastal habitats. Using these in combination with global extent of selected habitats, this chapter finds that GHGs worldwide, mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes combine to sequester a minimum of 136 000 tonnes C annually into long-term carbon storage. Assuming prices of CO2 epsilon from $10 to $90 per tonne, the value of the annual sequestration is $5-45 billion. This is an underestimate due to data gaps and, the limited assessment of the area of these three coastal ecosystem habitats, and relates only to long-term storage. The figures do not include short-term carbon storage in biomass, and further unaccounted for carbon sequestration occurs in kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal shelf seas. Many ECEs are under threat globally from sea-level rise, coastal development, pollution, and other anthropogenic stressors, and protection and restoration of ECEs may be an important tool for mitigating climate change. Currently, these habitats are not included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) carbon accounting frameworks, and therefore are excluded from incentive schemes such as carbon markets and other incentive programs, but their inclusion deserves consideration due to their potential for mitigating global climate change. The global distribution of C sequestration in ECEs reveals that large areas of the tropics are home to the highest sequestration rates and occur in developing countries, which also have the highest rates of coastal habitat degradation. Schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may bring revenues and added benefits to developing countries for instigating projects and marine protected areas for conservation.Many small island nations and developing countries in the tropics are particularly vulnerable to climate change and contain large swathes of seagrasses and mangroves compared to overall land area, but do not contain large areas of forests or grasslands, which would apply to REDD in its current form. Coastal habitats thus not only present an untapped potential for inclusion in climate change mitigation schemes, but also present a little-recognized risk of loss of large carbon stocks if their degradation and destruction are not reduced or halted.

TI  - Dynamics of sediment carbon stocks across intertidal wetland habitats of Moreton Bay, Australia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are known for high carbon storage within their sediments, but our understanding of the variation in carbon storage among intertidal habitats, particularly over geomorphological settings and along elevation gradients, is limited. Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of similar to 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger OC stocks (175-504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44-271 Mg/ha). Variation in OC stocks among nonriverine sites was high in comparison with riverine and mixed geomorphic settings, with sites closer to riverine outflow from the east and south of Moreton Bay having higher stocks than those located on the sand islands in the northwest of the bay. Sediment OC stocks increased with elevation within nonriverine settings, but not in riverine geomorphic settings. Sediment OC stocks did not differ between mangrove and saltmarsh habitats. OC stocks did, however, differ between dominant species across the research area and within geomorphic settings. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of the South East Queensland catchments (17,792 ha) are comprised of approximately 4,100,000-5,200,000 Mg of sediment OC. Comparatively high variation in OC storage between riverine and nonriverine geomorphic settings indicates that the availability of mineral sediments and terrestrial derived OC may exert a strong influence over OC storage potential across intertidal wetland systems.

TI  - Mangrove Range Expansion Rapidly Increases Coastal Wetland Carbon Storage
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marshes could significantly alter the carbon (C) storage capacity of coastal wetlands, which have the highest average C storage per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Mangrove range expansion is occurring globally, but little is known about how these rapid climate-driven shifts may alter ecosystem C storage. Here, we quantify current C stocks in ecotonal wetlands across gradients of marsh- to mangrove-dominance, and use unique chronological maps of vegetation cover to estimate C stock changes from 2003 to 2010 in a 567-km(2) wildlife refuge in the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. We report that over the 7-yr. period, total wetland C stocks increased 22 % due to mangrove encroachment into salt marshes. Newly established mangrove stands stored twice as much C on a per area basis as salt marsh primarily due to differences in aboveground biomass, and mangrove cover increased by 69 % during this short time interval. Wetland C storage within the wildlife refuge increased at a rate of 2.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr.(-1), more than doubling the naturally high coastal wetland C sequestration rates. Mangrove expansion could account for a globally significant increase of terrestrial C storage, which may exert a considerable negative feedback on warming.

TI  - Seventy years of continuous encroachment substantially increases "blue carbon' capacity as mangroves replace intertidal salt marshes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in ecosystem structure have been observed over recent decades as woody plants encroach upon grasslands and wetlands globally. The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.

TI  - Tidal marsh methane dynamics: Difference in seasonal lags in emissions driven by storage in vegetated versus unvegetated sediments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands exhibit high rates of carbon burial and storage in anaerobic sediments, but the extent to which carbon sequestration is offset by methane (CH4) emissions from these ecosystems remains unclear. In this study we combine measurements of sediment-air CH4 fluxes with monitoring of belowground CH4 pools in a New Jersey tidal marsh in order to clarify mechanistic links between environmental drivers, subsurface dynamics, and atmospheric emissions. Measurements were conducted in an unvegetated mud flat and adjacent low marsh vegetated with Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. Pore water measurements throughout the year revealed long-term CH4 storage in mud flat sediments, leading to a seasonal lag in emissions that extended into winter months. CH4 reservoirs and fluxes in vegetated sediments were well described by an empirical temperature-response model, while poor model agreement in unvegetated sediments was attributed to decouplings between production and flux due to storage processes. This study highlights the need to incorporate sediment gas exchange rates and pathways into biogeochemical process models.

TI  - Carbon on the Northwest European Shelf: Contemporary Budget and Future Influences
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A carbon budget for the northwest European continental shelf seas (NWES) was synthesized using available estimates for coastal, pelagic and benthic carbon stocks and flows. Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60-100 and 0-40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.

TI  - Groundwater Carbon Exports Exceed Sediment Carbon Burial in a Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Salt marshes can sequester large amounts of carbon in sediments, but the relation between carbon storage and exportation remains poorly understood. Groundwater exchange can flush sediment carbon to surface waters and potentially reduce storage. In this study, we estimated groundwater fluxes and associated carbon fluxes using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance and sediment carbon burial rates using lead (Pb-210) in a pristine salt marsh (North Inlet, SC, USA). We used delta C-13 to trace carbon origins. We found that groundwater releases large amounts of carbon to the open ocean. These groundwater fluxes have the potential to export 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 0.2 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 0.7 +/- 0.5 g m(-2) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per day. The fluxes exceed the average surface water CO2 emissions (0.6 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) day(-1)) and the average sediment carbon burial rates (0.17 +/- 0.09 g m(-2) day(-1)). The delta C-13 results suggest that groundwater carbon originated from salt marsh soils, while the sediment carbon source is derived from salt marsh vegetation. We propose that the impact of salt marshes in carbon cycling depends not only on their capacity to bury carbon in sediments, but also on their high potential to export carbon to the ocean via groundwater pathways.

TI  - Nitrogen enrichment alters carbon fluxes in a New England salt marsh
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Nitrogen enrichment of coastal salt marshes can induce feedbacks that alter ecosystem-level processes including primary production and carbon sequestration. Despite the rising interest in coastal blue carbon, the effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on blue carbon processes have rarely been measured in the context of experimental fertilization. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level effects of nitrate (NO3-) enrichment on the greenhouse gas dynamics of a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes using static chambers through two growing seasons in a salt marsh that was nitrogen-enriched for 13 years and compared fluxes to those from a reference marsh. Outcomes: We found that nitrogen enrichment increased gross primary productivity (GPP) by 7.7% and increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) by 20.8%. However, nitrogen enrichment had no discernible effect on net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Taken together, these results suggest that nitrogen-induced stimulation of R-eco could transform this salt marsh from a carbon sink into a source of carbon to the atmosphere. Conclusion: Our results complement prior findings of nitrogen enrichment weakening soil structure and organic matter stability in tidal salt marshes, suggesting that increased nutrient inputs have the potential to alter the carbon storage function of these ecosystems through enhanced microbial respiration of previously sequestered carbon.

TI  - Distribution of organic carbon storage in different salt-marsh plant communities: A case study at the Yangtze Estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The high carbon (C) sequestration potentials of coastal wetlands play an important role in mitigating climate change associated with the greenhouse effect. In the present study, soil samples were collected from the 0-30-cm topsoil layers and from 0 to 100-cm cores for the analysis of the spatial dynamics and vertical distribution of organic carbon (OC) and biomass in different vegetation zones in a small tidal basin in Chongming Dongtan wetland. According to the results, sediments in the region were a mixture of terrestrial and marine sources and the proportions of terrestrial components decreased with an increase in depth. In addition, soil properties were quite similar in the top-soil layer. In the study area, the OC concentration was in the 0.7-10.93 g/kg range, which was positively correlated with halophyte biomass and negatively correlated with soil salinity and particle size. Furthermore, OC content decreased with an increase in depth. The OC content in different halophyte communities was in the order of Phragmites australis community > Mixed community > sedge community, and was consistent with the gross biomass. The total C sequestered of 100-cm depth in the area was 31,177 ton, with the P. australis community, mixed community, sedge community, and water sequestering 57.7, 49.2, 25.5 t/ha, and 8 t/tidal cycle, respectively. Tidal marshes in Chongming Dongtan exhibited a high C sequestration capacity, indicating that they play a major role in the C cycle in the Yangtze Estuary.

TI  - Fertilization Effects on Elevation Change and Belowground Carbon Balance in a Long Island Sound Tidal Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the results of a 5-year fertilization experiment in a central Long Island Sound salt marsh, aimed at understanding the impacts of high nutrient loads on marsh elevational processes. Fertilization with nitrogen led to some significant changes in marsh processes, specifically increases in aboveground primary production and in CO2 fluxes from the soil. However, neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss (relative to controls), reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production, all of which have been proposed as links between elevated nutrient loads and marsh drowning. Our data suggest that high nutrient levels increase gross carbon loss from the sediment, but that this is compensated for by other processes, leading to no net deleterious effect of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability with respect to sea level rise.

TI  - Changes in carbon storage and macrobenthic communities in a mangrove-seagrass ecosystem after the invasion of smooth cordgrass in southern China
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has invaded intertidal wetlands near the Ronggenshan tidal flats of Beihai, Guangxi, China, where historically seagrasses and mangroves coexisted. We investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage and macrobenthic community structure in the existing mangroves (MG), S. alterniflora (SA), seagrass bed (SG), and unvegetated flat (UnV) habitats following the S. alterniflora invasion. SOC storage increased after S. alternifolia invasion in the SG and UnV habitats. Spartina alterniflora invasion changed the dominant species of the macrobenthos in the original habitats and reduced the diversity of macrobenthos in SG and UnV habitats. Clearly, S. alternifolia invasion can change the ecological functioning of south China's coastal ecosystems by altering carbon sequestration and affecting biodiversity.

TI  - Impact of dynamic feedbacks between sedimentation, sea-level rise, and biomass production on near-surface marsh stratigraphy and carbon accumulation
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes accrete both organic and inorganic sediments. Here we present analytical and numerical models of salt marsh sedimentation that, in addition to capturing inorganic processes, explicitly account for above- and belowground organic processes including root growth and decay of organic carbon. The analytical model is used to examine the bias introduced by organic processes into proxy records of sedimentation, namely Cs-137 and Pb-210. We find that accretion rates estimated using Pb-210 will be less than accretion rates estimated using the Cs-137 peak in steadily accreting marshes if (1) carbon decay is significant and (2) data for Pb-210 extend below the Cs-137 peak. The numerical model expands upon the analytical model by including belowground processes such as compaction and root growth, and by explicitly tracking the evolution of aboveground biomass and its effect on sedimentation rates. Using the numerical model we explore how marsh stratigraphy responds to sediment supply and the rate of sea-level rise. It is calibrated and tested using an extensive data set of both marsh stratigraphy and measurements of vegetation dynamics in a Spartina alterniflora marsh in South Carolina, USA. We find that carbon accumulation in marshes is nonlinearly related to both the supply of inorganic sediment and the rate of sea-level rise: carbon accumulation increases with sea-level rise until sea-level rise reaches a critical rate that drowns the marsh vegetation and halts carbon accumulation. The model predicts that changes in carbon storage resulting from changing sediment supply or sea-level rise are strongly dependent on the background sediment supply: if inorganic sediment supply is reduced in an already sediment poor marsh the storage of organic carbon will increase to a far greater extent than in a sediment-rich marsh, provided that the rate of sea-level rise does not exceed a threshold. These results imply that altering sediment supply to estuaries (e.g., by damming upstream rivers or altering littoral sediment transport) could lead to significant changes in the carbon budgets of coastal salt marshes.

TI  - Global-change controls on soil-carbon accumulation and loss in coastal vegetated ecosystems
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal seagrass, mangrove and salt-marsh ecosystems-also termed blue-carbon ecosystems-play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Much of the organic carbon they store rests in soils that have accumulated over thousands of years. Rapidly changing climate and environmental conditions, including sea-level rise, warming, eutrophication and landscape development, will impact decomposition and thus the global reservoir of blue soil organic carbon. Yet, it remains unclear how these disturbances will affect the key biogeochemical mechanisms controlling decomposition-mineral protection, redox zonation, water content and movement, and plant-microbe interactions. We assess the spatial and temporal scales over which decomposition mechanisms operate and how their effectiveness may change following disturbances. We suggest that better integration of decomposition mechanisms into blue-carbon models may improve predictions of soil organic carbon stores and facilitate incorporation of coastal vegetated ecosystems into global budgets and management tools.

TI  - Ungrazed salt marsh has well connected soil pores and less dense sediment compared with grazed salt marsh: a CT scanning study
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide various ecosystem functions and services including flooding protection, wildlife habitats, and carbon storage. These functions and services could, however, be strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities such as livestock grazing - a common practice in the Wadden Sea salt marshes located in North west of Europe. To assess the impact of grazing on soil parameters, a total number of eight soil cores (circle divide: 18 cm; L: 50 cm) were collected in areas with and without livestock grazing, and scanned using a Computed Tomography (CT) to characterize soil parameters including soil macroporosity, sediment density, and pores connectivity. Subsequently, sub-samples were taken for determination of soil moisture content (%) and bulk density (g cm(-3)). To account for the impact of grazing on soil drainage after tidal inundations, water table relative to soil surface was monitored during two flooding events. Our results demonstrated that grazed salt marsh has higher top-soil bulk density, and lower macroporosity and pore connectivity, than ungrazed marsh, due to soil compaction by livestock grazing. Moreover, grazed marsh has slower water drainage and that might keep the soil waterlogged for a longer period of time which has implications on lowering decomposition rate due to lower soil redox. This study provides evidence that grazing alters physical soil parameters in salt marsh. Consequently, grazing needs to be accounted for when evaluating how land use impacts ecosystem services and functions including carbon sequestration.

TI  - Climate and anthropogenic controls on blue carbon sequestration in Hudson River tidal marsh, Piermont, New York
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes globally are experiencing erosion with sea level rise. In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS C-14 chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat. We strongly recommend strategies for minimizing marsh loss.

TI  - Litter Decomposition of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus: Implications of Climate Change in Salt Marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Decomposition of plant litter in salt marshes plays an important role in coastal trophodynamics, nutrient cycling, sediment trapping, and short-term carbon storage, all of which are likely to be affected by climate change and accelerated sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, longer and more frequent inundation, and saltwater intrusion will all interact to affect decomposition of plant litter in a complex way. A combination of field experiments and model selection techniques was applied to study how these environmental factors affected litter decomposition of two dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results from summer field experiments conducted between June and August of 2013 showed that S. alterniflora in the low marsh had higher litter losses (0.286 +/- 0.0883 g d(-1), mean standard deviation) and decomposition coefficients (0.0115 +/- 0.00416 d(-1)) than J. roemerianus in the midmarsh locations (0.0963 +/- 0.0480 g 0.00416 +/- 0.00223 d(-1)). Modeling results showed that the interaction between temperature and salinity significantly affected decomposition coefficients of both species positively during this experiment. This study suggests that accelerated leaf litter decomposition due to rising temperature and increased salinity will occur under climate change and sea-level rise, and this will potentially lead to important ecological consequences for salt marshes.

TI  - Effects of simulated drought on the carbon balance of Everglades short-hydroperiod marsh
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrology drives the carbon balance of wetlands by controlling the uptake and release of CO2 and CH4. Longer dry periods in between heavier precipitation events predicted for the Everglades region, may alter the stability of large carbon pools in this wetland's ecosystems. To determine the effects of drought on CO2 fluxes and CH4 emissions, we simulated changes in hydroperiod with three scenarios that differed in the onset rate of drought (gradual, intermediate, and rapid transition into drought) on 18 freshwater wetland monoliths collected from an Everglades short-hydroperiod marsh. Simulated drought, regardless of the onset rate, resulted in higher net CO2 losses net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over the 22-week manipulation. Drought caused extensive vegetation dieback, increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and reduced carbon uptake gross ecosystem exchange (GEE). Photosynthetic potential measured by reflective indices (photochemical reflectance index, water index, normalized phaeophytinization index, and the normalized difference vegetation index) indicated that water stress limited GEE and inhibited R-eco. As a result of drought-induced dieback, NEE did not offset methane production during periods of inundation. The average ratio of net CH4 to NEE over the study period was 0.06, surpassing the 100-year greenhouse warming compensation point for CH4 (0.04). Drought-induced diebacks of sawgrass (C-3) led to the establishment of the invasive species torpedograss (C-4) when water was resupplied. These changes in the structure and function indicate that freshwater marsh ecosystems can become a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, even following an extended drought. Future changes in precipitation patterns and drought occurrence/duration can change the carbon storage capacity of freshwater marshes from sinks to sources of carbon to the atmosphere. Therefore, climate change will impact the carbon storage capacity of freshwater marshes by influencing water availability and the potential for positive feedbacks on radiative forcing.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Storage in Tidal Wetland and Its Relationships With Soil Physico-Chemical Factors : A Case Study of Dongtan of Chongming, Shanghai.
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Field investigation was made in March 2013 of Dongtan ( East Beach) of Chongming Island to explore carbon sequestrating function of tidal wetlands and its key influencing factors at the Yangtze Estuary. Sampling sites in Dongtan were laid out with the grid sampling method and elevations measured. Soil samples were collected from the 0-30 cm topsoil layers for analysis of soil organic carbon content, soil salt content, bulk density, soil moisture content, median particle size and pH. Based on the data obtained during the field investigation of Dongtan, spatial distribution of contents of soil organic carbon and their influencing environmental factors in the topsoil layer were analyzed and the soil organic carbon stock therein was assessed through Kriging interpolation with the aid of ArcGIS and through correlation and path analyses with the aid of SPSS. Results show that in the 30 cm topsoil layer, soil organic carbon density varied in the range of 1. 02-5. 22 kg . m(-2), averaging 2. 32 kg . m(-2), and the soil organic carbon storage reached 1. 15x10(8) kg. Soil organic carbon content, total salt content, soil water content and NDVI index were all quite similar in spatial distribution, being high in the north and low in the south and high in beaches with high tide and low in beaches with low tide, while median particle size and soil bulk density displayed quite reversely in spatial distribution, being higher in the south and beaches with low tide than in the north and beaches with high tide. However, elevation and pH did not follow any rule in spatial distribution and varied slightly spatially. All the 7 investigated environmental factors were found to have close relationships with soil organic carbon content. Total salt content, in particular, which is the most important factor affecting soil organic carbon content in the soil of Dongtan.

AB  - The ability of marshes and forested wetlands to provide environmental services (water retention in soil and carbon storage) was evaluated at three locations along the coast of Veracruz, Mexico. Hydro-periods were obtained for the different vegetation communities of marshes and forested wetlands. Total organic carbon contents were 26.2% in Pachira swamp, 23.1% in Ficus swamp and 11.2% in marsh soils. The largest values of hydraulically active pore space were observed for marshes (0.79 cm(3) cm(-3)), and the lowest in forested wetlands (0.57 cm(3) cm(-3)). Soil water holding capacity ranged from 556 to 834 L m(-2) for swamp areas and from 687 to 880 L m(-2) for marshes. The thickness of soil organic layers in the wetland studied had a major control on soil water storage. This suggests that a vast amount of rain water could be retained in the soil. The results indicate that both swamps and marshes play important roles in their capacities to retain water and sequester carbon, although there were no significant differences among them.

TI  - First results of energy and mass exchange in a salt marsh on southeastern South America
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are vulnerable ecosystems since they are found in locations often preferred for urban development. They produce a great amount of biomass, and also are of great interest because of the ecosystem services they provide from which carbon storage stands out. This work aims to study the energy and mass exchanged by a salt marsh located in southeastern Buenos Aires province (Argentina) and to characterize its net ecosystem production. A field campaign was carried out from February 2014 to March 2015. Sensible heat, water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with eddy covariance technique at 6 m height over a Spartina densiflora canopy. Fifty five percent of the data were lost and 15% more were discarded due to low turbulence conditions. This gaps were filled with a combination of techniques (look-up tables and mean diurnal variations), which allowed the estimation of monthly mean net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. As in other marshes, the latent heat flux consumed more than 55% of the available energy of the system, reaching up to 85% after a large flood event. This flux systematically exceeds the values of sensible heat measured throughout the study period. Unlike other environments, this southern salt marsh behaved as a CO2 sink throughout the year. The net ecosystem production from March 2014 to February 2015 was approximately -10.5 t of CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) which is greater than reported results for other wetlands. These preliminary results for a southern S. densiflora salt marsh are encouraging, although new field studies are under way to confirm their accuracy.

AB  - Blue Carbon is a term coined in 2009 to draw attention to the degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems and the need to conserve and restore them to mitigate climate change and for the other ecosystem services they provide. Blue Carbon has multiple meanings, which we aim to clarify here, which reflect the original descriptions of the concept including (1) all organic matter captured by marine organisms, and (2) how marine ecosystems could be managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation and conservation. The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists, conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies. Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs). Others have gaps in scientific understanding of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas fluxes, or currently there is limited potential for management or accounting for carbon sequestration (macroalgae and phytoplankton), but may be considered Blue Carbon ecosystems in the future, once these gaps are addressed.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study compares the amounts of carbon fixed via photosynthesis of a restored tidal marsh to the total organic carbon remaining in sediments of a natural tidal marsh and arrives at preliminary baselines for carbon sequestration and storage over time. The Eddy-covariance method (indirect method) was used to estimate marsh canopy net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and measured an annual gross primary production of 979 g C m(-2), while the loss through respiration was 766g Cm-2, resulting in a net uptake of 213 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Time of the day, solar irradiation, air temperature, humidity and wind direction all together explained 66% of the variation in NEE. The high marsh community of Spartina patens showed NEE to be significantly higher than the low marsh community. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over long time scales was estimated by measuring the actual amount of total organic carbon contained in dated sediment cores from a natural marsh (direct method), which resulted in a carbon accumulation rate of 192.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Changes in total organic carbon content over time in the core sample showed that 78% of organic carbon remained stored in the sediments after 130 years and only the most recalcitrant carbon (50%) remained under storage beyond 645 years. Overall the study showed that temperate macrotidal salt marshes are net sinks of carbon with potential for long term carbon storage. The marsh turned into a carbon sink at the beginning of May and switched back to being a source in late November. The average sedimentation rate estimated from the 137 CS dating (1950s to present) was 1.4 mm yr(-1) which is similar to accretion rates of comparable S. patens patches in the east coast. Accretion rates derived from our study are slightly lower than the 60+ year rate of sea level rise (2.6 mm yr(-1)) recorded by tide gauge measurements in the Northeast. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marshes could significantly alter the carbon (C) storage capacity of coastal wetlands, which have the highest average C storage per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Mangrove range expansion is occurring globally, but little is known about how these rapid climate-driven shifts may alter ecosystem C storage. Here, we quantify current C stocks in ecotonal wetlands across gradients of marsh- to mangrove-dominance, and use unique chronological maps of vegetation cover to estimate C Stock changes from 2003 to 2010 in a 567-km 2  wildlife refuge in the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Wetland Mapping and Historical Change Detection at the Nisqually River Delta
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important ecosystems for carbon storage and coastal resilience to climate change and sea-level rise. As such, changes in wetland habitat types can also impact ecosystem functions. Our goal was to quantify historical vegetation change within the Nisqually River watershed relevant to carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and wetland sustainability, and identify watershed-scale anthropogenic and hydrodynamic drivers of these changes. To achieve this, we produced time-series classifications of habitat, photosynthetic pathway functional types and species in the Nisqually River Delta for the years 1957, 1980, and 2015. Using an object-oriented approach, we performed a hierarchical classification on historical and current imagery to identify change within the watershed and wetland ecosystems. We found a 188.4 ha (79%) increase in emergent marsh wetland within the Nisqually River Delta between 1957 and 2015 as a result of restoration efforts that occurred in several phases through 2009. Despite these wetland gains, a total of 83.1 ha (35%) of marsh was lost between 1957 and 2015, particularly in areas near the Nisqually River mouth due to erosion and shifting river channels, resulting in a net wetland gain of 105.4 ha (44%). We found the trajectory of wetland recovery coincided with previous studies, demonstrating the role of remote sensing for historical wetland change detection as well as future coastal wetland monitoring.

T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation.

TI  - Ditching and Ditch-Plugging in New England Salt Marshes: Effects on Hydrology, Elevation, and Soil Characteristics
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities in New England salt marshes have altered hydrologic flows in various ways, but unintended consequences from some types of habitat modifications have received little attention. Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.

TI  - Direct and indirect controls on organic matter decomposition in four coastal wetland communities along a landscape salinity gradient
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands store more carbon than most ecosystems globally. As sea level rises, changes in flooding and salinity will potentially impact ecological functions, such as organic matter decomposition, that influence carbon storage. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control organic matter loss in coastal wetlands at the landscape scale. As sea level rises, how will the shift from fresh to salt-tolerant plant communities impact organic matter decomposition? Do long-term, plant-mediated, effects of sea-level rise differ from direct effects of elevated salinity and flooding?We identified internal and external factors that regulated indirect and direct pathways of sea-level rise impacts, respectively, along a landscape-scale salinity gradient that incorporated changes in wetland type (fresh, oligohaline, mesohaline and polyhaline marshes). We found that indirect and direct impacts of sea-level rise had opposing effects on organic matter decomposition.Salinity had an indirect effect on litter decomposition that was mediated through litter quality. Despite significant variation in environmental conditions along the landscape gradient, the best predictors of above- and below-ground litter decomposition were internal drivers, initial litter nitrogen content and initial litter lignin content respectively. Litter decay constants were greatest in the oligohaline marsh and declined with increasing salinity, and the fraction of litter remaining (asymptote) was greatest in the mesohaline marsh. In contrast, direct effects of salinity and flooding were positive. External drivers, salinity and flooding, stimulated cellulytic activity, which was highest in the polyhaline marsh.Synthesis. Our results indicate that as sea level rises, initial direct effects of salinity will stimulate decay of labile carbon, but over time as plant communities shift from fresh to polyhaline marsh, litter decay will decline, yielding greater potential for long-term carbon storage. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying carbon loss at multiple temporal scales, not only in coastal wetlands but also in other ecosystems where plant-mediated responses to climate change will have significant impacts on carbon cycling.

TI  - Wetlands In a Changing Climate: Science, Policy and Management
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Review
AB  - Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.

TI  - Invasion and Extirpation Potential of Native and Invasive Spartina Species Under Climate Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planet's most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Salt marshes are environmental ecosystems that contribute to coastal landscape resiliency to storms and rising sea level. Ninety percent of mid-Atlantic and New England salt marshes have been impacted by parallel grid ditching that began in the 1920s?40s to control mosquito populations and to provide employment opportunities during the Great Depression (James-Pirri and others, 2009; Kennish, 2001). Continued alteration of salt marsh hydrology has had unintended consequences for salt marsh sustainability and ecosystem services. Great Barnstable Marsh (Barnstable, Cape Cod, Massachusetts) has areas of salt marsh that were ditched as well as natural areas. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured parameters for groundwater wells (water elevation, water depth below land surface, salinity, and water temperature), soil and air temperature, and other meteorological parameters. All these parameters affect plant productivity and are key components of salt marsh carbon cycling, carbon storage, and its ability to maintain elevation in response to changing sea level. These USGS datasets can be used to evaluate changes in water levels across ditched and natural salt marsh regions and provide information for any future studies of salt marsh productivity and geomorphic models in Great Barnstable Marsh.James-Pirri, M.-J.,Ginsberg, H.S., Erwin,R.m., and Taylor, J., 2009, Effects of open marsh water management on numbers of larval salt marsh mosquitoes: Journal of Medical Entomology, 46(6), 1392-1399, doi:10.1603/033.046.0620.

TI  - Aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbaceous marsh is the most widely distributed type of marsh wetland ecosystem, and has important ecological functions such as water conservation, climate regulation, carbon storage and fixation, and sheltering rare species. The carbon sequestration function of herbaceous marsh plays a key role in slowing climate warming and maintaining regional environmental stability. Vegetation biomass is an important index reflecting the carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands. Investigating the biomass of marsh vegetation can provide a scientific basis for estimating the carbon storage and carbon sequestration capacity of marshes. Based on field survey data of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation and the distribution data set of marsh in China, we analyzed the aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh on a national scale for the first time. The results showed that in China the total area of herbaceous marsh was 9.7x10(4) km(2), the average density of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation was 227.5 +/- 23.0 g C m(-2) (95% confidence interval, the same below), and the total aboveground biomass was 22.2 +/- 2.2 Tg C (1 Tg=10(12) g). The aboveground biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation is generally low in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, and high in central North China and coastal regions in China. In different marsh distribution regions of China, the average biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation from small to large was as follows: temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (182.3 +/- 49.3 g C m(-2))<Tibetan Plateau marsh region (243.9 +/- 26.6 g C m(-2))<temperate arid and semi-arid marsh region (300.5 +/- 73.2 g C m(-2))<subtropical humid marsh region (348.4 +/- 59.0 g C m(-2))<coastal marsh region (675.4 +/- 73.8 g C m(-2)). Due to the different area of herbaceous marsh, the total above-ground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in different marsh distribution regions was the largest in the temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (9.6 +/- 2.6 Tg C), and was the smallest in the coastal marsh region (1.1 +/- 0.1 Tg C). The spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China has obvious non-zonality characteristics, but also presents certain zonality in some regions. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau decreased with the increase of altitude. With the aggravation of drought, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions and temperate arid and semi-arid regions decreased first and then did not obviously change. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions was relatively larger in the regions with higher average annual temperature. The results can provide scientific basis for accurately evaluating the adjustment action of wetland ecosystems on climate, and provide decision support for adaptive management of wetland ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh structure and function, and consequently ability to support a range of species and to provide ecosystem services, may be affected by climate change. To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens-Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open-topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens-D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens-D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea-level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea-level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions.

TI  - The Valuation of Ecosystem Services in the Venice Lagoon: A Multicriteria Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are among the most economically valuable and highly threatened on Earth; they provide valuable ecosystem services (ESs) but are severely exposed to climate changes and human pressure. Although the preservation of coastal ecosystems is of the utmost importance, it is often sub-optimally pursued by Governments and Societies because of the high costs involved. We consider salt-marsh ecosystems in the Venice Lagoon as an example of a threatened landscape, calling for innovative, integrated management strategies, and propose an application-driven methodological framework to support policymakers in the identification of cost-effective incentive policies to ecosystem preservation. By combining group decision-making and Value-Focused-Thinking approaches, we provide a multiple-criteria decision model, based on pairwise comparisons, to identify which ESs are top-priority policy targets according to a cost-effective perspective. We implemented an online Delphi survey process and interviewed a pool of experts who identified "recreation and tourism", "coastal protection from flooding", "carbon storage", "biodiversity and landscape", and "nursery habitats for fisheries" as the five most relevant ESs for the Venice Lagoon taking into consideration the Environmental, Economic, and Social perspectives. Our results suggest that the Environmental perspective is the most important criteria, whereas "biodiversity and landscape" is acknowledged as the most important ES.

TI  - Temporal records of organic carbon stocks and burial rates in Mexican blue carbon coastal ecosystems throughout the Anthropocene
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems provide important and multiple ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation through carbon storage. However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Biogeographic gradients in ecosystem processes of the invasive ecosystem engineer Phragmites australis
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Latitudinal gradients in ecosystem patterns arise from complex interactions between biotic and abiotic forces operating at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Widespread invasive species, particularly invasive ecosystem engineers with large effects on their environment, may alter these gradients. We sampled 3-5 stands of the invasive common reed, Phragmites australis, in eight coastal wetlands ranging from Massachusetts (42 degrees N) to South Carolina (32 degrees N) to document geographic variation in P. australis primary production, associated plant and animal species diversity, and sediment carbon storage and to examine how local-, regional-, and large-scale environmental factors contribute to these patterns. Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables. The percent of developed land was positively associated with P. australis density, yet this variable had relatively low predictive power in our study. Our study provides an important biogeographic perspective for documenting and understanding variation in invasive P. australis that is fundamental both for managing the invasion and for understanding latitudinal gradients in ecosystem structure and function.

TI  - Vulnerability to sea-level rise and the potential for restoration to enhance blue carbon storage in salt marshes of an urban estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to 'coastal squeeze' and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

TI  - The 10 Australian ecosystems most vulnerable to tipping points
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We identify the 10 major terrestrial and marine ecosystems in Australia most vulnerable to tipping points, in which modest environmental changes can cause disproportionately large changes in ecosystem properties. To accomplish this we independently surveyed the coauthors of this paper to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, and then refined this list during a 2-day workshop. The list includes (1) elevationally restricted mountain ecosystems, (2) tropical savannas, (3) coastal floodplains and wetlands, (4) coral reefs, (5) drier rainforests, (6) wetlands and floodplains in the Murray-Darling Basin, (7) the Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Australia, (8) offshore islands, (9) temperate eucalypt forests, and (10) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem we consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that we deem to be especially vulnerable.

TI  - Stand density and carbon storage in cypress-tupelo wetland forests of the Mississippi River delta
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested wetlands play a vital role in the coastal zone, but their vulnerability to coastal change-and the impact to high-value ecosystem services-is not as well established as that of more seaward systems such as saltmarsh and mangroves. To address this need, we develop field-based stand density classes, then classify baldcypress-water tupelo (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich var. distichurm Nyssa aquatica L) stand density on the Mississippi River delta using a multitemporal ordination of reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Approximately 29, 50, and 21% of forest was classified as full canopy, intermediate, and open canopy, respectively. We estimate stand-level live-stem carbon stocks and annual accumulation rates of 96, 67, and 39 t-C ha(-1) and 1.9, 1.4 and 0.8 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for full-canopy, intermediate, and open-canopy forest, respectively. Regional live-stem carbon stocks are similar to 69 t-C ha(-1), and total carbon and annual increment for all forest analyzed are similar to 17 Mt-C and similar to 0.34 Mt-C yr-1. Much of the cypress-tupelo forest on the delta stores carbon at rates significantly below the potential of fully stocked stands, yet overall rates of accumulation are comparable to other forest types and coastal systems. Delta-wide, there is a well-defined coastward gradient of stand density, which has important implications for the future of deltaic forests and their ecosystem services. The similarities between forest density gradients and well-documented marsh loss patterns in the region suggest that the same processes driving coastal marsh loss-relative sea level rise exacerbated by human activity-are likely responsible for a second, more gradual interface of land loss at the marsh-forest boundary. Results highlight the potential response of coastal forests to continued environmental change-and associated impacts to the carbon cycle-and provide a baseline for detecting future change to forests on the Mississippi River delta.

TI  - Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions Complicate Coastal Blue Carbon Assessments
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The role of coastal wetlands as natural 'blue carbon' sinks may be counter-acted by emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Site-specific fluxes of these two potent greenhouse gases from coastal wetlands show high spatial and temporal variability , making global estimates sensitive to statistical assumptions and uncertainties. Here, we review the magnitude of CH4 and N2O fluxes from mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses and identify direct and indirect drivers that can control production and consumption pathways. Significant research is required to better quantify fluxes and to understand factors causing flux variability from different transport pathways before restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems can be reliably used for climate mitigation.Plain Language Summary Mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows are 'blue carbon' ecosystems that provide a wide range of societal benefits, including carbon storage in their sediments and biomass in the case of mangroves. Yet they can also be a source-and sometimes a sink-of two powerful greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide. Many processes are involved in the release and uptake of these gases; as a result, the local variability of coastal wetland emissions is high and global budgets are uncertain. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is worthwhile for many reasons, and their existing carbon stores need to be kept intact. Nevertheless, their potential as a natural climate solution needs further attention, since it may have been over-stated.

TI  - Seasonal patterns and plant-mediated controls of subsurface wetland biogeochemistry
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In tidal marshes, spatial and temporal variability in the importance of microbial metabolic pathways influences ecosystem-level processes such as soil carbon storage, the regeneration of inorganic nutrients, and the production of atmospherically important trace gases. We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron-sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plantmediated processes. In midsummer, Fe(III) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe(III) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils. Our data suggested that variations in microbial metabolic pathways were regulated by physiochemical factors at the brackish site and plant activity at the freshwater site. Plant regulation of Fe(III) reduction is a largely unstudied mechanism by which plants influence wetland carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.

TI  - Mapping salt marsh soil properties using imaging spectroscopy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marshes sequester and store blue carbon at both short and long time scales. Marsh soils shape and maintain the ecosystem by supporting complex biogeochemical reactions, deposition of sediment, and accumulation of organic matter. In this study, we examined the potential of imaging spectroscopy techniques to indirectly quantify and map tidal marsh soil properties at a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Georgia, USA. A framework was developed to combine modern digital image processing techniques for marsh soil mapping, including object-based image analysis (OBIA), machine learning modeling, and ensemble analysis. We also evaluated the efficacy of airborne hyperspectral sensors in estimating marsh soil properties compared to spaceborne multispectral sensors, WorldView-2 and QuickBird. The pros and cons of object-based modeling and mapping were assessed and compared with traditional pixel-based mapping methods. The results showed that the designed framework was effective in quantifying and mapping three marsh soil properties using the composite reflectance from salt marsh environment: soil salinity, soil water content, and soil organic matter content. Multispectral sensors were successful in quantifying soil salinity and soil water content but failed to model soil organic matter. The study also demonstrated the value of minimum noise fraction transformation and ensemble analysis techniques for marsh soil mapping. The results suggest that imaging spectroscopy based modeling is a promising tool to quantify and map marsh soil properties at a local scale, and is a potential alternative to traditional soil data acquisition to support carbon cycle research and the conservation and restoration of tidal marshes.

TI  - Causal mechanisms of soil organic matter decomposition: deconstructing salinity and flooding impacts in coastal wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands significantly contribute to global carbon storage potential. Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short-and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands. Here, we identify three causal mechanisms that can reconcile disparities between long-term and short-term salinity impacts on organic matter decomposition.

TI  - Local geomorphological gradients affect sedimentary organic carbon storage: A Blue Carbon case study from sub-tropical Australia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal blue carbon systems (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes) are renowned for their efficacy at sequestering large amounts of carbon (C) in sedimentary sinks and effective management action to preserve these C stocks requires an understanding of spatial variability within an estuary. This study analysed 33 coastal blue carbon sediment cores across three subtropical estuaries of Eastern Australia. We measured depth, C content and dry bulk density down the soil profile. Mean C stocks for mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh, up to a 3 metre depth, were estimated to be 738 +/- 119, 439 +/- 72, and 823 +/- 138 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Linear regression models showed the relationship between distance from ocean and C stocks was significant in mangroves and saltmarsh (p <= 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), with the exception of mangroves in an urbanised estuary which displayed the inverse. The differences we observed in C stocks in mangroves and saltmarsh, not seagrass, in relation to location within the estuary may have important implications for management actions and ecological processes.

TI  - Soil carbon storage and carbon sources under different Spartina alterniflora invasion periods in a salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component of global change, plant invasion threaten the sustainability of global ecosystems and may alter the carbon dynamics in the invaded area. Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important "blue carbon" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion. This work indicates causal relationships between plant invasions and soil carbon pools and highlights the nonnegligible importance of inorganic C in coastal blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Blue carbon conservation in West Africa: a first assessment of feasibility
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of blue carbon ecosystems results in significant levels of carbon emissions and decreased supply of other ecosystem services. West Africa contains approximately 14% of the world's mangrove area but despite 25% of coverage loss between 1980 and 2006, the region's mangroves have not been well studied. This study aims to provide a first step toward increasing the knowledge of the region's blue carbon stocks, with a focus on mangroves, and of their financial value based on their carbon storage benefit alone. The best available data suggest that the region contains 1.97 million hectares of mangroves storing 854 million metric tons of carbon in above- and below-ground biomass and the top meter of soil; 4.8 million hectares of seagrass storing 673 million metric tons of carbon; and 1.2 million hectares of salt marshes storing 303 million metric tons of carbon. Even without including values for other benefits of intact mangroves, the conservation of mangroves in the region appears viable. Specifically, the discounted value of 20-year emission reductions under a conservation scenario is estimated to be between $341.2-569.0 million at an 8% discount rate and carbon prices of $3 and $5 per metric ton respectively.

TI  - Groundwater-Driven Methane Export Reduces Salt Marsh Blue Carbon Potential
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The burial of "blue carbon" in coastal marsh soils is partially offset by marsh-atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, but this offset may be greater if other pathways of CH4 export exist. Here we report that salt marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative tracer Ra-226 at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the 2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m(3) day(-1). Dissolved CH4 fluxes of 27-1,200 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) were calculated by multiplying the volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3-5.5 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1). This is equivalent to 125 (56-245) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) assuming that CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to the 138 (1.1-260) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) average calculated across other studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a combined total of similar to 30% of the global cooling potential derived from soil carbon sequestration.Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are wetland ecosystems found along the coast. Scientists and policymakers are interested in salt marshes because they accumulate carbon in their soil over long time scales. This carbon would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, exacerbating global climate change. However, microorganisms living in the soil break down some of this buried carbon and produce other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that contribute more to warming than carbon dioxide. Scientists have measured how much methane escapes from the soil to the atmosphere. Carbon burial more than offsets this methane export, meaning that salt marshes have a small net cooling effect on Earth's climate. In this study, we incorporate a previously unaccounted pathway for methane export from salt marshes into their radiative budget. Methane in marsh soil and surrounding sediments can be dissolved in groundwater that discharges from the pore spaces between soil and sediment particles. This groundwater flows slowly toward the marsh edge until it discharges into nearby surface waters, carrying dissolved methane with it. We estimate that this methane export from groundwater approximately doubles total methane emissions from salt marshes. This is still not enough methane export to counteract all of the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils. However, it is important for policymakers to include both pathways of methane export when calculating the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils or its economic value.

T2  - Mendeley Data
M3  - Data set
AB  - This dataset consists of raster layers representing carbon stock (T CO2e ha-1), carbon sequestration, and economic value (USD) using the high and low ends of the range of estimated carbon storage. The names and details of each raster are described in the included CSV file. We used a range of carbon sequestration values to measure carbon stock (T CO2e ha-1) in 2016 (start of modeling), 2030, 2060, and 2100. We chose these time points because they are commonly used in coastal planning horizons. We also measured carbon sequestration (T CO2e ha-1) between these time points. We estimated the net present value (USD) of carbon sequestration (removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) as an ecosystem service at 2030, 2060, and 2100. We used two metrics of valuation: (1) price of one metric ton of carbon on the California Carbon Exchange (assuming the cost of carbon remained stable over the analysis period), (2) the Social Cost of Carbon, or the cost of societal damages from each additional ton of carbon in the atmosphere. We generated raster layers for each carbon modeling output using the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon Model from the Natural Capital Project. For each location, time horizon, and high/low estimate, we created one raster for each of the four carbon metrics described above. We listed these output rasters in a CSV spreadsheet with details on which modeling scenario they correspond to and their file paths. All rasters were originally projected in NAD_1983_Albers using ArcMap. We modeled several alternative scenarios for the future of tidal marshes. For all three case study locations, we projected the values of carbon metrics if the marsh extent were to remain stable across the modeling period. This was referred to as the No Change scenario. For Humboldt Bay, we modeled the restoration of McDaniel Slough (McDaniel Slough Restoration scenario). In Tijuana River Estuary, we modeled carbon metrics based on based on changes in marsh cover since 1850 (Historic to Modern Landscape).

TI  - Electron donors and acceptors influence anaerobic soil organic matter mineralization in tidal marshes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anaerobic decomposition in wetland soils is carried out by several interacting microbial processes that influence carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. To understand the role of wetlands in the global carbon cycle, it is critical to understand how differences in both electron donor (i.e., organic carbon) and terminal electron acceptor (TEA) availability influence anaerobic mineralization of soil organic matter. In this study we manipulated electron donors and acceptors to examine how these factors influence total rates of carbon mineralization and the pathways of microbial respiration (e.g., sulfate reduction versus methanogenesis). Using a field-based reciprocal transplant of soils from brackish and freshwater tidal marshes, in conjunction with laboratory amendments of TEAs, we examined how rates of organic carbon mineralization changed when soils with different carbon contents were exposed to different TEAs. Total mineralization (the sum of CO2 + CH4 produced) on a per gram soil basis was greater in the brackish marsh soils, which had higher soil organic matter content: however, on a per gram carbon basis, mineralization was greater in the freshwater soils, suggesting that the quality of carbon inputs from the freshwater plants was higher. Overall anaerobic metabolism was higher for both soil types incubated at the brackish site where SO42- was the dominant TEA. When soils were amended with TEAs in the laboratory, more thermodynamically favorable respiration pathways typically resulted in greater organic matter mineralization (Fe(III) respiration > SO42- reduction > methanogenesis). These results suggest that both electron donors and acceptors play important roles in regulating anaerobic microbial mineralization of soil organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of soil as a carbon sink in coastal salt-marsh and agropastoral systems at La Pletera, NE Spain
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the potential of natural and modified salt-marsh soils to store organic carbon and their soil properties, we investigated six soil environments located at La Pletera salt-marsh area, NE Spain. Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.

TI  - Shallow ponds are biogeochemically distinct habitats in salt marsh ecosystems
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Runaway expansion of shallow ponds can catalyze the conversion of vegetated marshes into open water environments. Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.

TI  - Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - [1] Wetlands represent the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon pool and thus play an important role in global carbon cycles. Most global carbon budgets, however, have focused on dry land ecosystems that extend over large areas and have not accounted for the many small, scattered carbon-storing ecosystems such as tidal saline wetlands. We compiled data for 154 sites in mangroves and salt marshes from the western and eastern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. The set of sites spans a latitudinal range from 22.4degreesS in the Indian Ocean to 55.5degrees N in the northeastern Atlantic. The average soil carbon density of mangrove swamps (0.055 +/- 0.004 g cm(-3)) is significantly higher than the salt marsh average (0.039 +/- 0.003 g cm(-3)). Soil carbon density in mangrove swamps and Spartina patens marshes declines with increasing average annual temperature, probably due to increased decay rates at higher temperatures. In contrast, carbon sequestration rates were not significantly different between mangrove swamps and salt marshes. Variability in sediment accumulation rates within marshes is a major control of carbon sequestration rates masking any relationship with climatic parameters. Globally, these combined wetlands store at least 44.6 Tg C yr(-1) and probably more, as detailed areal inventories are not available for salt marshes in China and South America. Much attention has been given to the role of freshwater wetlands, particularly northern peatlands, as carbon sinks. In contrast to peatlands, salt marshes and mangroves release negligible amounts of greenhouse gases and store more carbon per unit area.

TI  - The intertidal plant communities in north-eastern Australia, their carbon stores and vulnerability to extreme climate events
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the strong El Nino event of 2015-2016 large-scale dieback of mangrove forests was observed in the Gulf of Carpentaria region of northern Australia. These and other intertidal communities are also extensive along the 7,400 km coastline of north-eastern Australia. Determination of their floristic composition, potential carbon (C) store and sequestration capacity, and vulnerability to climate extremes is required for their effective conservation management and was the aim of this study. Standardized, state-wide quantitative classification methods identified five mangrove forest and three saltmarsh communities covering 2,604 km(2)along this coastline. Estuarine and oceanic mangrove forests were mapped separately. Carbon storage and sequestration capacity of the intertidal communities and their vulnerability to strong El Nino events were estimated using published data and GIS analyses. An estimated potential 126.2 (+/- 27.3 SEM) Tg C and 8.3 (+/- 0.4 SD) Tg C were stored in the mangrove forests and saltmarshes, respectively. Comparatively, the rainforests of the region stored an estimated equivalent amount of C but covered three times the area, and the most widespread woodlands (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) of the region stored an estimated 1.5 times the C but covered 16 times the area. The C stored in the intertidal communities was estimated as equivalent to 493.47 Tg of CO(2,)valued at AU$6.8 billion on the Australian carbon market in December 2018. Annual C sequestration potential was 0.18-0.34 Tg C/year, valued between AU$8.9 and $17 million. Approximately 360 ha of mangrove forest was estimated as lost because of dieback during the 2015-16 El Nino event. Three types of mangrove forest were identified as potentially vulnerable to dieback from El Nino-driven climate events. This study highlights the national and global significance of these intertidal systems and our findings need to be incorporated in future conservation and development planning of northern Australia.

TI  - Submarine Groundwater Discharge-Derived Carbon Fluxes in Mangroves: An Important Component of Blue Carbon Budgets?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plain Language Summary Mangroves are blue carbon systems characterized by high soil carbon storage and sequestration. Soil carbon losses via groundwater or pore water pathways are potentially important yet poorly understood components of mangrove carbon budgets. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) fluxes into a mangrove-dominated tropical bay (Maowei Sea) using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model. The SGD fluxes in Maowei Sea were estimated to be 4.9x10(7) (0.360.33m/day) and 2.6x10(7)m(3)/day (0.200.18m/day) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively, implying that SGD may respond to precipitation. The SGD-derived DIC and DOC fluxes (molm(-2)day(-1)) in the wet season (DIC: 0.700.82; DOC: 0.310.30) were higher than those in the dry season (DIC: 0.250.24; DOC: 0.25 +/- 0.23). These SGD-derived carbon fluxes exceed local river inputs and constituted >70% of the total DIC and DOC input into the bay. If scaled up to the global weighted mangrove area in combination with data from other 32 study sites, carbon fluxes via SGD into mangroves may be equivalent to 29-48% of the global riverine input into the ocean. Therefore, we suggest that SGD is a major component of coastal carbon budgets and that accounting for SGD helps to reduce uncertainties in mangrove blue carbon budgets.Mangrove soils sequester large amounts of carbon, but little is known on the loss of carbon via groundwater pathways. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge using radon and related dissolved inorganic and organic carbon fluxes in a mangrove-dominated tropical bay in China (Maowei Sea). Combining our results with literature data revealed that groundwater fluxes in mangroves are significant and should be considered in blue carbon assessments.

TI  - Forecasting tidal marsh elevation and habitat change through fusion of Earth observations and a process model
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing uncertainty in data inputs at relevant spatial scales can improve tidal marsh forecasting models, and their usefulness in coastal climate change adaptation decisions. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially. Improving information for coastal modeling will support planning for ecosystem services, including habitat, carbon storage, and flood protection.

TI  - The role of elevation, relative sea-level history and vegetation transition in determining carbon distribution in Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

TI  - A Synthesis of Blue Carbon Stocks, Sources, and Accumulation Rates in Eelgrass (Zostera marina) Meadows in the Northeast Pacific
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing urgency to implement climate change mitigation strategies that enhance greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Recently, coastal "blue carbon" habitats-mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows-have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m(-2), respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OCm-2 y(r-1) and averaged 24.8 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats.

TI  - Long-term rice cultivation stabilizes soil organic carbon and promotes soil microbial activity in a salt marsh derived soil chronosequence
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration with enhanced stable carbon storage has been widely accepted as a very important ecosystem property. Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation. However, the mechanism underpinning these changes should be explored in future studies in rice soils where dynamic redox conditions exist.

TI  - Effects of Invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. and Subsequent Ecological Replacement by Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. on Soil Organic Carbon Fractions and Stock
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: The rapid spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the mangrove ecosystems of China was reduced using Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. as an ecological replacement. Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi'ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi'ao Island. These results indicate that ecological replacement methods can enhance long term carbon storage in Spartina-invaded ecosystems and native mangrove species are recommended.

TI  - Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage by Baja California (Mexico) Tidal Wetlands and Evidence for Wetland Stability in the Face of Anthropogenic and Climatic Impacts.
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (~0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO₂eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.

TI  - Rapid recovery of carbon cycle processes after the cessation of chronic nutrient enrichment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide critical ecosystem services including some of the highest rates of carbon storage on Earth. However, many salt marshes receive very high nutrient loads and there is a growing body of evidence indicating that this nutrient enrichment alters carbon cycle processes. While many restoration plans prioritize nutrient management in their efforts to conserve salt marsh ecosystems, there has been little empirical investigation of the capacity for carbon cycle processes to recover once nutrient loading is reduced. To address this, we compared rates of greenhouse gas fluxes (i.e., CO2 and methane) measured using static chambers, and soil organic matter decomposition, using both litter bags and the Tea Bag Index (TBI), during the last two years of a long-term, ecosystem-scale nutrient enrichment experiment (2015-2016) as well as in the first two years of recovery post-enrichment (2017-2018). We found that both ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and decomposition processes (i.e., rhizome decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization) were enhanced by nutrient enrichment, but returned to reference ecosystem levels within the first year following the cessation of nutrient enrichment and remained at reference levels in the second year. These results suggest that management practices intended to reduce nutrient loads in coastal systems may, in fact, allow for rapid recovery of carbon cycle processes, potentially restoring the high carbon sequestration rates of these blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Heterogeneous tidal marsh soil organic carbon accumulation among and within temperate estuaries in Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of data on tidal marsh soil accumulation rates (SAR) and soil organic carbon accumulation rates (CAR) globally precludes a comprehensive assessment of the role of tidal marshes in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Particularly few data exist from the southern hemisphere and for Australia in particular, which contains similar to 24% of globally recognised tidal marsh extent. Here we estimate SAR and CAR over the last 70 years using Pb-210-based geochronologies in temperate estuarine tidal marsh ecosystems in southern Western Australia (WA). Specifically, we assessed tidal marsh ecosystems situated in two geomorphic settings (marine vs. fluvial deltas) within 10 wave-dominated, barrier estuaries. Overall, average SAR (1.1 +/- 0.3 mm yr(-1)) and CAR (32 +/- 9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) estimates were 5-fold lower than global mean estimates. Furthermore, we showed that hotspots of soil organic carbon stocks are not indicative of current hotspots for CAR. The lack of significant differences (P > 0.05) in SAR, CAR, and excess Pb-210 inventories between marine and fluvial settings can be explained by the high heterogeneity among and within estuaries throughout the region. The relative stability of recent and Holocene relative sea-levels in WA likely explains the limited CAR potential in tidal marshes under relatively stable sea-level conditions. However, further research exploring interactions among biotic and abiotic factors within estuaries is required to shed more light on the small spatial-scale variability in SAR and CAR across tidal marsh ecosystems in WA and elsewhere. This study provides baseline estimates for the inclusion of tidal marshes in national carbon inventories, identifies hotspots for the development of blue carbon projects, and supports the use of site-specific assessments opposed to regional means for estimating blue carbon resources.

TI  - Decomposition of seawater-irrigated halophytes: implications for potential carbon storage
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawater-irrigated halophytes are a non-traditional crop that may serve to offset anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions through long-term carbon storage. To assess the feasibility of storing carbon as cultivated halophyte residues in coastal desert soils, the decay rate, microbial activity and microbial decomposer abundance of postharvest residues were investigated for three potential halophyte crops. Decay rates were determined by measuring weight loss from residues in litterbags in both the field and laboratory. The effect of incorporating residues into the soil was examined by locating litterbags both on and below the soil surface. Microbial decomposition activity was measured as the CO(2) efflux from residue amended soil columns in the greenhouse. The abundance of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes was assessed in decomposing residues using litterbags in the field. The three halophytes decomposed at rates similar to those of conventional, non-saline residues (0.20-0.30% d(-1)) whether placed on the surface or buried at 30 cm. Residue type affected microbial activity in soil columns during the first 21 days, but decomposition was similar for the three halophytes thereafter. Residue type affected the abundance of nematodes, but not of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Because the rate of halophyte residue decay and the number of microbial decomposers associated with the residues are similar to those of fresh water systems, there appears to be no advantage in storing carbon as plant residue in this saline agricultural system.

TI  - Saltmarsh soil evolution after land reclamation in Atlantic estuaries (Bay of Biscay, North coast of Spain)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tidal wetland soils exhibit particular physical-chemical properties governed mainly by tidal dynamics. On the Atlantic seaboard of the Iberian Peninsula a great swath of tidal wetlands, which correspond to semi-confined estuaries, represents land reclaimed from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and used for urban development or agricultural production. These interventions led to the end of tidal flooding in extensive areas of salt marshes, Causing a drop in the water table that triggered pyrite oxidization processes, leaching of cations and salts and soil acidification. In many cases, these transformations have given rise to environmental problems such as the development of acid sulphate soils, a resulting decrease in pH, and the leaching of carbonates. The organic carbon storage capacity has also been altered, and the release of metal cations from sediments has caused toxic waters to appear.In order to investigate the alterations caused by the historic reclamation of estuarine soils on the north coast of Spain, natural and reclaimed lands were mapped in two estuaries (Villaviciosa and San Vicente de la Barquera) and zoned in accordance with flood frequency.The different evolutionary paths of the two studied estuarine sites after reclamation can be assessed through the description and analysis of their soils despite reclamation, some parts (i.e. lower areas) of the reclaimed lands do not remain fully isolated from tidal dynamics, whose influence varies throughout the soil profiles that have developed since. The strength of the morphological (e.g. genetic horizons). chemical (pH, metal cation concentration) and functional (balance of the carbon budget) changes suffered by the original soils seem to depend strongly on the remaining tidal influence as well as the land use of the area.

TI  - New Insights Into the Influence of Plant and Microbial Diversity on Denitrification Rates in a Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing numerous services such as soil carbon storage, flood protection and nutrient filtering, several of which are mediated by the sediment microbiome associated with marsh vegetation. Here, nutrient filtering (nitrate removal through denitrification) was examined by determining microbial (bacteria and archaea) community structure (16S rRNA gene iTag sequencing), diversity, denitrification rates and metabolic potential (assembled metagenomic sequences) in collocated patches of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) and Juncus roemerianus (Juncus) sediments. The iTag data showed that diversity and richness in Spartina and Juncus sediment microbial communities were highly similar. However, microbial community evenness differed significantly, with the most even communities observed in Juncus sediments. Further, denitrification rates were significantly higher in Juncus compared to Spartina, suggesting oscillations in microbial abundances and in particular the core microbiome identified herein, along with plant diversity influence marsh nitrogen (N) removal. Amplicon and assembled metagenome sequences pointed to a potentially important, yet unappreciated Planctomycetes role in N removal in the salt marsh. Thus, ecosystem perturbations that alter marsh vegetation distribution could impact microbial diversity and may ultimately influence the ecologically important ecosystem functions the marsh sediment microbiome provides.

TI  - Carbon Storages along a Climate Induced Coastal Wetland Gradient
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the globe, coastal wetland vegetation distributions are changing in response to climate change. In the southeastern United States, increased winter temperatures have resulted in poleward range expansion of mangroves into pure salt marsh habitat. Climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marsh will significantly alter carbon (C) storage capacity of these wetlands, which currently store the highest average C per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Total ecosystem C stocks were measured along a 342 km latitudinal gradient of mangrove - to - marsh dominance in Florida. Carbon stocks were quantified through measurements of above- and belowground biomass and soil C. Interior mangrove C stocks were greater than both salt marsh and ecotonal C stocks and soil C comprised the majority of each ecosystem C component (51-98%). The wetlands investigated in this study cover 38,532 ha, and store an average of 215 Mg of C ha(-1). Currently, mangroves cover 31% of the land area studied, storing 44% of the total C, whereas salt marshes occupy 68% of the wetland area and only store 55% of the C. Total conversion of salt marsh to mangrove may increase C storage by 26%, predominately due to increases in aboveground biomass.

TI  - The Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII): An inundation filter to flag flooded pixels and improve MODIS tidal marsh vegetation time-series analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change of aboveground biomass and its response to climate change in marshes of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has a large area of marshes which play a crucial part in the global carbon cycle. The vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) is a critical indicator of carbon storage of marsh ecosystems. Due to the limitations of field investigation, the spatiotemporal variation of AGB and its influencing factors of the Tibetan Plateau marshes remain unclear. By using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), climate and measured AGB data, this study investigated the temporal and spatial variation of marsh AGB and its response to climate change in the Tibetan Plateau during 2000-2019. The results showed a good correlation between AGB and annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax), and the AGB can be accurately estimated from a power function equation between marshes biomass and NDVImax (Y = 343.08 x NDVImax0.7363). Based on the function equation, we found that AGB density increased significantly (4.10 gmiddotC/m(2)/decade) from 2000 to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau, with an average value of 184.71 gmiddotC/m(2). In terms of climate effects, increased precipitation in July could significantly increase marsh AGB, while precipitation in other months has no significant effect on the marsh AGB in the Tibetan Plateau. This study first found an asymmetric impact of night and day temperature on AGB in the Tibetan Plateau marshes: warming day-time temperature has no-significant effect on marsh AGB, while night-time warming can significantly increase the AGB of marshes. Considering the background of global asymmetric warming in nighttime and daytime, more attention should be paid to the different impacts of day and night temperatures on marsh AGB in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Contrasting nutrient stocks and litter decomposition in stands of native and invasive species in a sub-tropical estuarine marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the influence of invasion by an alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, smooth cordgrass) and a native aggressive species (Phragmites australis, common reed) as they have expanded into the native Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass)-dominated wetland ecosystem in the Min River estuary of southeast China. S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Modeling long-term salt marsh response to sea level rise in the sediment-deficient Plum Island Estuary, MA
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accelerating global rate of sea level rise (SLR), coupled with direct human impacts to coastal watersheds and shorelines, threatens the continued survival of salt marshes. We developed a new landscape-scale numerical model of salt marsh evolution and applied it to marshes in the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, U.S.A.), a sediment-deficient system bounded by steep uplands. To capture complexities of vertical accretion across the marsh platform, we employed a novel approach that incorporates spatially variable suspended sediment concentrations and biomass of multiple plant species as functions of elevation and distance from sediment sources. The model predicts a stable areal extent of Plum Island marshes for a variety of SLR scenarios through 2100, where limited marsh drowning is compensated by limited marsh migration into adjacent uplands. Nevertheless, the model predicts widespread conversion of high marsh vegetation to low marsh vegetation, and accretion deficits that indicate eventual marsh drowning. Although sediment-deficient marshes bounded by steep uplands are considered extremely vulnerable to SLR, our results highlight that marshes with high elevation capital can maintain their areal extent for decades to centuries even under conditions in which they will inevitably drown.

TI  - Potential fate of wetland soil carbon in a deltaic coastal wetland subjected to high relative sea level rise
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fate of soil carbon in eroding coastal wetlands is of great concern, given the potential for a feedback loop from coastal wetland soil that would dramatically increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top - 0-20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

TI  - Mangroves dramatically increase carbon storage after 3 years of encroachment
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In North America, the dynamic ecotonal boundary between mangrove and salt marsh is currently fluctuating in response to freeze-free winters, which can cause rapid alterations in a number of wetland processes and attributes. Permanent plots were established in pure salt marsh habitat along the Atlantic coast of Florida in 2015, and by 2018, mangrove saplings had encroached into plots. In this study, above- and belowground biomass measurements and soil C in the top 10-cm soil profile were quantified in 2018 and compared to 2015 data to better understand the effects of mangrove encroachment on C storage in salt marsh habitat. Plant and soil fractions were tested for C-13 stable isotopic signatures to elucidate soil C sources. In 3 years, mangrove biomass increased dramatically and soil C doubled in pure salt marsh plots, consequently increasing total C in the system. Soil organic matter increased, while there was no change in soil C:N. C-13 values suggest that soil C was derived mainly from salt marsh soil organic matter, especially that of belowground, rather than aboveground biomass. These results provide real-time, quantitative data on the encroachment of mangroves into salt marshes over a relatively short period of time.

TI  - Emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O from freshwater marsh in northeast of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The wetlands play an important role in carbon storage, especially at high latitudes, at which they store nearly one-third of global soil carbons. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the long-term, especially effects of freeze-thaw cycles on these gases emissions in freshwater marsh ecosystems. In this paper, we collected greenhouse gas emission data from a freshwater marsh area in China for 4 years, evaluated their release variables and speculated on their potential atmospheric impact. For this paper, we report on the CO2, CH4 and NO emission rates recorded from June 2002 to November 2005 in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. We measured their interannual variations and fluctuations, as well as factors affecting their emissions, and estimated their regulation and freeze-thaw cycle impacts. Our results revealed obvious CO2 and CH4 emission fluctuations during the winter months, and during the freeze-thaw cycle, and a strong interannual variation during the growing season. Overall, we documented a close relationship between the CO2 and CH4 emissions, implicating some regulatory commonality. We determined that the marsh was a N2O sink during the winter, but a significant source of NO during the freeze-thaw cycle as the temperature increased, especially in early summer. During the thaw-freeze period, the N2O levels were positively correlated with the water depth. Additionally, water depth greatly governed the interannual variation of the N2O emissions from the marshes during the thaw-freeze period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of short-term invasion of Spartina alterniflora and the subsequent restoration of native mangroves on the soil organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stock
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the mangrove wetlands in southern China and ecological restoration using native mangroves was conducted in an attempt to control this invasive species. In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

TI  - How Plants Influence Resilience of Salt Marsh and Mangrove Wetlands to Sea-Level Rise
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Review
AB  - This review evaluates the importance of plants and associated biological processes in determining the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise. Coastal wetlands occur across a broad sedimentary continuum from minerogenic to biogenic, providing an opportunity to examine the relative importance of biological processes in wetland resilience to sea-level rise. We explore how plants influence sediment accretion, elevation capital (vertical position in the tidal frame), and compaction or erosion of deposited material. We focus on salt marsh and mangrove wetlands, which occupy a similar physiographic niche and display similar physical and biological controls on resilience to sea-level rise. In both habitats, plants stabilize emergent mudflats and help sustain the wetland position in the tidal frame relative to ocean height through both surface and subsurface process controls on soil elevation. Plants influence soil elevations by modifying (1) mineral sediment deposition and retention, (2) organic matter contributions to soil volume, and (3) resistance to compaction and erosion. Recognition of the importance of plants in coastal wetland resilience to sea-level rise is key to accurate predictions about the future fate of salt marshes and mangrove forests and for development of effective management and restoration plans.

TI  - Effects of water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Water and salinity regulation measures have been widely taken to restore the ecological structures and functions of degraded coastal wetlands. To investigate the effects of different water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands, soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in four types of wetlands (i.e., restored tidal salt marshes (RTSM, covered with Suaeda salsa) and degraded tidal salt marshes (DTSM, bare land); freshwater restored wetlands (FRW) and degraded wetlands without freshwater inputs (DWFI), covered with Phragmites australis) during the period from August to October in 2015 in the Yellow River Delta, China. Our results showed that the mean values of total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in restored wetlands (e.g., RTSM and FRW) than those in degraded wetlands (e.g., DTSM and DWFI). Along the whole soil profile, TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC were higher in RTSM soils than those in DTSM soils except for TC and SOC in the 0-10 cm soils and DOC in the 40-50 cm soils. FRW soils contained higher TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC than DWFI except for DOC in the 0-10 cm soils. Soil TC density (TCD), SOC density (SOCD), ROOC density (ROOCD) and DOC density (DOCD) in the top 50 cm soils in restored wetlands were higher compared with degraded wetlands. Multivariate analysis showed that soil carbon was significantly influenced by EC, soil base cations and anions (e.g., K+, Ca2+ Cl- and SO42-), pH, TN, C/N ratio, bulk density (BD) and soil texture (p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that these two water and salinity regulation measures are effective in increasing soil carbon stocks of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Adjusting Emergent Herbaceous Wetland Elevation with Object-Based Image Analysis, Random Forest and the 2016 NLCD
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent herbaceous wetlands are characterized by complex salt marsh ecosystems that play a key role in diverse coastal processes including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, flood attenuation and shoreline protection. Surface elevation characterization and spatiotemporal distribution of these ecosystems are commonly obtained from LiDAR measurements as this low-cost airborne technique has a wide range of applicability and usefulness in coastal environments. LiDAR techniques, despite significant advantages, show poor performance in generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) in tidal salt marshes due to large vertical errors. In this study, we present a methodology to (i) update emergent herbaceous wetlands (i.e., the ones delineated in the 2016 National Land Cover Database) to present-day conditions; and (ii) automate salt marsh elevation correction in estuarine systems. We integrate object-based image analysis and random forest technique with surface reflectance Landsat imagery to map three emergent U.S. wetlands in Weeks Bay, Alabama, Savannah Estuary, Georgia and Fire Island, New York. Conducting a hyperparameter tuning of random forest and following a hierarchical approach with three nomenclature levels for land cover classification, we are able to better map wetlands and improve overall accuracies in Weeks Bay (0.91), Savannah Estuary (0.97) and Fire Island (0.95). We then develop a tool in ArcGIS to automate salt marsh elevation correction. We use this 'DEM-correction' tool to modify an existing DEM (model input) with the calculated elevation correction over salt marsh regions. Our method and tool are validated with real-time kinematic elevation data and helps correct overestimated salt marsh elevation up to 0.50 m in the studied estuaries. The proposed tool can be easily adapted to different vegetation species in wetlands, and thus help provide accurate DEMs for flood inundation mapping in estuarine systems.

TI  - Feedback of coastal marshes to climate change: Long-term phenological shifts
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are important carbon sinks facing serious threats from climatic stressors. Current research reveals that the growth of individual marsh plants is susceptible to a changing climate, but the responses of different marsh systems at a landscape scale are less clear. Here, we document the multi-decadal changes in the phenology and the area of the extensive coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, a representative of coastal ecosystems around the world that currently experiencing sea-level rise, temperature warming, and atmospheric CO2 increase. The phenological records are constructed using the longest continuous satellite-based record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat data, and an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model. We find that the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes increased concomitantly with the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the last 30 years, and predict that such changes will continue and accelerate in the future. These phenological changes suggest a potential increase in CO2 uptake and thus a negative feedback mechanism to climate change. The areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were stable over the period studied, but the areas of the brackish and saline marshes decreased substantially, suggesting ecosystem instability and carbon storage loss under the anticipated sea-level rise. The marshes' phenological shifts portend their potentially critical role in climate mitigation, and the different responses among systems shed light on the underlying mechanisms of such changes.

TI  - Sea Level Rise Explains Changing Carbon Accumulation Rates in a Salt Marsh Over the Past Two Millennia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High rates of carbon burial observed in wetland sediments have garnered attention as a potential "natural fix" to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere. A carbon accumulation rate (CAR) can be determined through various methods that integrate a carbon stock over different time periods, ranging from decades to millennia. Our goal was to assess how CAR changed over the lifespan of a salt marsh. We applied a geochronology to a series of salt marsh cores using both C-14 and Pb-210 markers to calculate CARs that were integrated between 35 and 2,460 years before present. CAR was 39 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) when integrated over millennia but was upward of 148 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) for the past century. We present additional evidence to account for this variability by linking it to changes in relative sea level rise (RSLR), where higher rates of RSLR were associated with higher CARs. Thus, the CAR calculated for a wetland should integrate timescales that capture the influence of contemporary RSLR. Therefore, caution should be exercised not to utilize a CAR calculated over inappropriately short or long timescales as a current assessment or forecasting tool for the climate change mitigation potential of a wetland.

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The significance of sediment structure for soil structure has often been disregarded when discussing the properties and genesis of tidal marsh soils. After defening several terms that are often misinterpreted, three types of tidal-marsh-soils with different structure are described: 1. the typical clayey tidal-marsh-soils with very various aggregate structures: The well aired and permeable ''SEEMARSCH'' (marine-tidal-marsh-soil) with polyhedral and prismatic structure, which is formed from the flaky ''card-house'' structure of marine sediments rich on salt; the densely paked ''BRACKMARSCH'' (brackish-tidal-marsh-soil), whose moisture is due to perched water, which coarse prismatic to columnar structure, which is formed from the mainly horizontally orientet structure of brackish sediments due to dispersion; the moderately permeable ''FLUSSMARSCH'' (tidal-river-marsh-soil), whose wetness is often due to groundwater, with medium to coarse prismatic structure, which is formed from the finely aggregated structure of perimarine tidal-river sediments; 2. the tidal marsh soils poor in clay, rich in silt and very fine sand with coherent structure and low air porosity, due to a strong tendency towards puddling of the top soil by raindrops, causes the formation of ''HAFTNASSEMARSCH'' (marsh soil whose moisture is due to capillar water); 3. the tidal-marsh-soils rich in plant remains, clay and with a high level of groundwater, often extremly acid, with coherent structure, which formed the generally highly permeable ''ORGANOMARSCH''. The conditions of formation of these soils and the soil parameters are discussed also.

TI  - Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage by Baja California (Mexico) Tidal Wetlands and Evidence for Wetland Stability in the Face of Anthropogenic and Climatic Impacts
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.

TI  - Living shorelines achieve functional equivalence to natural fringe marshes across multiple ecological metrics
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based shoreline protection provides a welcome class of adaptations to promote ecological resilience in the face of climate change. Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a coastal adaptation strategy.

TI  - Global change accelerates carbon assimilation by a wetland ecosystem engineer
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary productivity of coastal wetlands is changing dramatically in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, nitrogen (N) enrichment, and invasions by novel species, potentially altering their ecosystem services and resilience to sea level rise. In order to determine how these interacting global change factors will affect coastal wetland productivity, we quantified growing-season carbon assimilation (approximate to gross primary productivity, or GPP) and carbon retained in living plant biomass (approximate to net primary productivity, or NPP) of North American mid-Atlantic saltmarshes invaded by Phragmites australis (common reed) under four treatment conditions: two levels of CO2 (ambient and + 300 ppm) crossed with two levels of N(0 and 25 gN added m(-2) yr(-1)). For GPP, we combined descriptions of canopy structure and leaf-level photosynthesis in a simulation model, using empirical data from an open-top chamber field study. Under ambient CO2 and low N loading (i.e., the Control), we determined GPP to be 1.66 +/- 0.05 kg Cm-2 yr(-1) at a typical Phragmites stand density. Individually, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 44 and 60%, respectively. Changes under N enrichment came largely from stimulation to carbon assimilation early and late in the growing season, while changes from CO2 came from stimulation during the early and mid-growing season. In combination, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 95% over the Control, yielding 3.24 +/- 0.08 kg Cm-2 yr(-1). We used biomass data to calculate NPP, and determined that it represented 44%-60% of GPP, with global change conditions decreasing carbon retention compared to the Control. Our results indicate that Phragmites invasions in eutrophied saltmarshes are driven, in part, by extended phenology yielding 3.1 x greater NPP than native marsh. Further, we can expect elevated CO2 to amplify Phragmites productivity throughout the growing season, with potential implications including accelerated spread and greater carbon storage belowground.

TI  - Substantial role of macroalgae in marine carbon sequestration
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We propose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr(-1) (with a range of 61-268 TgC yr(-1)) globally. About 90% of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats.

TI  - Carbon Accumulation in Freshwater Marsh Soils: a Synthesis for Temperate North America
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater marshes are prevalent in North America, yet their soil carbon stocks remain poorly quantified. To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50-100 years); these short-term rates are on average (+/- SD) 155 +/- 74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 +/- 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future.

TI  - Appraising soil carbon storage potential under perennial and annual Chenopodiaceae in salt marsh of NE Spain
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The work was conducted at La Pletera salt marsh (NE Spain) to investigate the potential for atmospheric carbon capture of perennial Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.

TI  - Variations in food utilisation and carbon sequestration by the polychaete Nereis virens under experimental conditions
T2  - VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variations in food utilisation, particularly storage, by Nereis virens are not well documented. This behaviour often results in carbon sequestration, the extent of which remains unknown. Observations oil food utilisation by Nereis virens were conducted under experimental conditions of controlled temperature, food supply and photoperiod. The amount of ingested and stored food both increase with ration, but the latter does so more rapidly than the former. When food is rare, worms usually prioritise feeding over storing. However, immediate storage is more advantageous than feeding when worms are able to capture extra rations. This strategy is predominant when food is abundant because benefits far outweigh costs. The extrapolation of carbon storage under experimental conditions to natural populations suggests that storage mostly takes place between April and September. Summer storage is likely to be short term because of the predominance of algae, whereas autumn storage is likely to be long term because of vascular plants. The importance of storage on the carbon cycle is difficult to evaluate, but biogeographical distribution and densities of Nereis virens suggest a non-negligible effect.

TI  - Testing the interactive effects of flooding and salinity on tidal marsh plant productivity
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands support plant communities that facilitate carbon storage, accrete soil, and provide habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest.

TI  - Salinity Affects Topsoil Organic Carbon Concentrations Through Regulating Vegetation Structure and Productivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine salt marshes have been recognized as one of the most efficient carbon sinks in the biosphere, with considerable potential for climate change mitigation. However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.

TI  - TIPPING POINTS AND THE VULNERABILITY OF AUSTRALIA'S TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY: VOICES FROM THE TROPICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - I identify the major tropical ecosystems in Australia that are most vulnerable to tipping points, in which modest environmental changes can cause disproportionately large changes in ecosystem properties. To accomplish this, I surveyed 24 researchers in Australia to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, which was then refined during a workshop in late 2010. The list includes (1) montane rainforests; (2) tropical savannas; (3) tropical floodplains and wetlands; (4) coral reefs; (5) drier rainforests; (6) tropical islands; and (7) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem I consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that appear especially vulnerable.

TI  - The resilience of coastal ecosystems: A functional trait-based perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human population, such as nurseries for fish, carbon storage and coastal protection. However, the pressure faced by these systems due to global changes will strongly challenge the capacity of coastal ecosystems to persist. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the resilience of coastal ecosystems.Here, I propose that combining a resilience framework based on ecosystem properties with the functional trait response-effect framework would allow researchers and managers to quantify the resilience of coastal ecosystems. I place emphasis on salt marsh and sand dunes because of the higher availability of studies for these systems.First, I introduce the resilience framework based on ecosystem properties and, second, I show how adopting a functional trait perspective in this framework would allow researchers to link how environmental changes influence ecosystem properties. In turn, measuring the changes in ecosystem properties would allow researchers to measure the resilience of the system.Synthesis. I reviewed several types of disturbances (e.g. storms and sea-level rise) that are threatening the persistence of coastal ecosystems, with an emphasis on salt marshes and sand dunes. Applying this resilience framework reveals, for instance, that the same suite of traits (e.g. plant density and stiffness) increase marsh resistance to multiple threats (e.g. storms and sea-level rise); yet, these traits vary along environmental gradients (e.g. along estuaries) and, therefore, marshes resilience vary accordingly. Overall, this framework would allow researchers to gather crucial insights on the resilience of coastal ecosystems and to set reference marks for measuring their resilience under environmental changes.

TI  - Dataset: Increased Organic Carbon Burial in Northern Florida Mangrove-Salt Marsh Transition Zones
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea-level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Studies on mangrove migration have revealed conflicting results regarding carbon burial, with some suggesting mangrove migration does not increase burial. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr-1) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr-1). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 gC m-2 yr-1) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 gC m-2 yr-1) and salt marsh (4-7 gC m-2 yr-1) sites. Lignin biomarker data (Lambda-6, Lambda-8, C/V) indicated mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol gC-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol gC-1) and lower C/N indicated these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicates this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.  Although carbon burial rates increased with mangrove expansion at the northern Florida sites, questions remained regarding future changes in these wetlands with a warming climate and sea-level rise. To better understand potential future responses of these wetlands, two studies were undertaken using longer sediment cores at the same northern Florida sites to examine the wetlands development over the mid- to late-Holocene. Carbon measurements within 1-3 meter length vibracores yielded total core stocks of 9.8 x 103 - 2.1 x 104 gC m-2 and 7.4 x 103 - 9.5 x 103 gC m-2 for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates down to 1-meter were 6.8 x 103 gC m-2 - 7.3 x 103 gC m-2 and 5.8 x 103 gC m-2 - 8.6 x 103 gC m-2 for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta13C, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines likely experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into former non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following changes in relative sea-level rise and climate. This suggests that not all blue carbon was estimated in the Atlantic coast cores when restricting measurements to the 1-meter benchmark and some carbon deposited in a carbonate-dominant system was included in the 1-meter Gulf coast stocks. Constraining blue carbon measurements to include carbon within 1-meter thus may over- or under-estimate blue carbon stocks. If the natural carbon burying capabilities of these habitats are to be utilized in the future, preservation of regions upslope of wetlands is critical to allow for inland migration in response to ongoing sea-level rise.

TI  - Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus Contents of Wetland Soils in Relation to Environment Factors in Northeast China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (OC) is sensitive to climatic change, and it can be expected to manifest measurable responses to global warming. Globally, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common nutrients limiting plant growth and soil carbon storage. We collected soil samples at 17 marsh sites in August 2012 across Northeast China. These samples were analysed for variations in soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels, and multiple controlling of environmental and biotic factors. Results showed the means to be as follows: 16,850.7 mmol kg(-1) (OC), 540.5 mmol kg(-1) (TN), 30.0 mmol kg(-1) (TP), 29.9 (C:N), 516.5 (C:P) and 16.8 (N:P). The OC, TN, TP and C:N:P ratios decreased with increases in the mean annual temperature (MAT) and flooding depth, whereas the C:N ratio did not change significantly with the flooding depth. Quadratic relationships were observed between the OC, TN and TP and soil pH. Linear mixed-effect models showed that climate exerted great influences on soil nutrients. These results will improve our understanding of the ecological patterns of nutrient fluxes and the biogeochemical mechanisms of the response of vegetation to climate changes.

TI  - Metagenomics coupled with biogeochemical rates measurements provide evidence that nitrate addition stimulates respiration in salt marsh sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-throughput sequencing has enabled robust shotgun metagenomic sequencing that informs our understanding of the genetic basis of important biogeochemical processes. Slower to develop, however, are the application of these tools in a controlled experimental framework that pushes the field beyond exploratory analysis toward hypothesis-driven research. We performed flow-through reactor experiments to examine how salt marsh sediments from varying depths respond to nitrate addition and linked biogeochemical processes to this underlying genetic foundation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marsh sediments is critical for predicting how important ecosystem services provided by marshes, including carbon storage and nutrient removal, will respond to global change. Prior to the addition of nitrate, we used metagenomics to examine the functional potential of the sediment microbial community that occurred along a depth gradient, where organic matter reactivity changes due to decomposition. Metagenomic data indicated that genes encoding enzymes involved in respiration, including denitrification, were higher in shallow sediments, and genes indicative of resource limitation were greatest at depth. After 92 d of nitrate enrichment, we measured cumulative increases in dissolved inorganic carbon production, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; these rates correlated strongly with genes that encode essential enzymes in these important pathways. Our results highlight the importance of controlled experiments in linking biogeochemical rates to underlying genetic pathways. Furthermore, they indicate the importance of nitrate as an electron acceptor in fueling microbial respiration, which has consequences for carbon and nitrogen cycling and fate in coastal marine systems.

TI  - Carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes of the Amazon region, Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world. While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range. Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical dry forests.

TI  - Geochemical analyses reveal the importance of environmental history for blue carbon sequestration
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia. Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands are known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level, and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four corestwo collected from marine-influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo marine site (WAP-M) and Port Stephens marine site (POR-M)) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo fluvial site (WAP-F) and Port Stephens fluvial site (POR-F))highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C; however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

TI  - The importance of geomorphic context for estimating the carbon stock of salt marshes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured total carbon stocks of three marshes: Two formed in association with a developing spit along the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of New Brunswick, Canada, and another with a lagoon on the coast of Maine, USA. Overall, 46 cores and 157 depth recordings were collected to determine depth of the marsh deposits. Total marsh soil volume was estimated by interpolation. In all marshes soil depth varied in a predictable pattern based upon marsh developmental history. In spit marshes deposit age and thickness increased towards the oldest portion of the spit. In the lagoonal marsh, soil depth was greatest in the center and dedined towards both the upland and seaward margins. This same pattern held on axes perpendicular to the primary, age axis of the spit marshes. In each marsh C density did not significantly vary with depth so that marsh depth was an acceptable estimator of C stock, and therefore driven by the geomorphic context of the marshes we studied. There were major differences in C stock estimates produced using GIS interpolation, average C contained in all marsh cores, or cores along a single transect. Our study demonstrates that assuming a soil depth of just 0.5 or 1 m can substantially under- or overestimate marsh carbon stocks and the value of that stock on a carbon market.

TI  - Review of the ecosystem service implications of mangrove encroachment into salt marshes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Salt marsh and mangrove have been recognized as being among the most valuable ecosystem types globally in terms of their supply of ecosystem services and support for human livelihoods. These coastal ecosystems are also susceptible to the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, with evidence of global shifts in the distribution of mangroves, including encroachment into salt marshes. The encroachment of woody mangrove shrubs and trees into herbaceous salt marshes may represent a substantial change in ecosystem structure, although resulting impacts on ecosystem functions and service provisions are largely unknown. In this review, we assess changes in ecosystem services associated with mangrove encroachment. While there is quantitative evidence to suggest that mangrove encroachment may enhance carbon storage and the capacity of a wetland to increase surface elevation in response to sea-level rise, for most services there has been no direct assessment of encroachment impact. On the basis of current understanding of ecosystem structure and function, we theorize that mangrove encroachment may increase nutrient storage and improve storm protection, but cause declines in habitat availability for fauna requiring open vegetation structure (such as migratory birds and foraging bats) as well as the recreational and cultural activities associated with this fauna (e.g., bird-watching and/or hunting). Changes to provisional services such as fisheries productivity and cultural services are likely to be site specific and dependent on the species involved. We discuss the need for explicit experimental testing of the effects of encroachment on ecosystem services in order to address key knowledge gaps, and present an overview of the options available to coastal resource managers during a time of environmental change.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Estimation of Seagrass Percent Cover and LAI for Above Ground Carbon Sequestration Mapping

AB  - Seagrasses are distinct flowering plants which thrive underwater. They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

TI  - The roles of vegetation, tide and sediment in the variability of carbon in the salt marsh dominated tidal creeks
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined effects of vegetation, tide and sediment on the carbon dynamics in the intertidal creek-marsh systems remain unclear. We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks. Our results are helpful in reliable estimates of carbon transport between the coastal marsh and the adjacent ocean.

TI  - Sedimentary Factors are Key Predictors of Carbon Storage in SE Australian Saltmarshes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although coastal vegetated ecosystems are widely recognised as important sites of long-term carbon (C) storage, substantial spatial variability exists in quantifications of these 'blue C' stocks. To better understand the factors behind this variability we investigate the relative importance of geomorphic and vegetation attributes to variability in the belowground C stocks of saltmarshes in New South Wales (NSW), southeast Australia. Based on the analysis of over 140 sediment cores, we report mean C stocks in the surface metre of sediments (mean +/- SE = 164.45 +/- 8.74 Mg C ha(-1)) comparable to global datasets. Depth-integrated stocks (0-100 cm) were more than two times higher in fluvial (226.09 +/- 12.37 Mg C ha(-1)) relative to marine (104.54 +/- 7.11) geomorphic sites, but did not vary overall between rush and non-rush vegetation structures. More specifically, sediment grain size was a key predictor of C density, which we attribute to the enhanced C preservation capacity of fine sediments and/or the input of stable allochthonous C to predominantly fine-grained, fluvial sites. Although C density decreased significantly with sediment depth in both geomorphic settings, the importance of deep C varied substantially between study sites. Despite modest spatial coverage, NSW saltmarshes currently hold approximately 1.2 million tonnes of C in the surface metre of sediment, although more C may have been returned to the atmosphere through habitat loss over the past approximately 200 years. Our findings highlight the suitability of using sedimentary classification to predict blue C hotspots for targeted conservation and management activities to reverse this trend.

TI  - Blue carbon: Knowledge gaps, critical issues, and novel approaches
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon - the carbon stored and sequestered in mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal salt marshes is considered a cost-effective means to achieve positive climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes. Blue carbon is therefore of considerable interest to the scientific and policy communities, and is frequently discussed in relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper identifies peer-reviewed and 'gray literature' documents that discuss blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue carbon literature is dominated by technical and policy commentary, with a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the nature and role of important concepts including private and public sector finance and instruments; and (3) understanding of the important issues of investment priorities and risk considerations is also limited. This paper therefore identifies gaps in the blue carbon literature, clarifies critical concepts and issues, and proposes novel pathways for blue carbon research and project development (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dataset: Factors influencing blue carbon accumulation across a 32‐year chronosequence of created coastal marshes
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea‐level rise, land‐use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short‐ and longer‐term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from 12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m 2 ·yr 1 , which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer‐term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m 2 ·yr 1  but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site‐specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

TI  - Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.

TI  - Experimental influence of storm-surge salinity on soil greenhouse gas emissions from a tidal salt marsh
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm surges can substantially alter the water level and salinity in tidal salt marshes. Little is known about how changes experienced during storm surges affect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O) from tidal salt marsh soils. Understanding how storm surges influence ecosystem processes is critical for evaluating the ecosystem's sensitivity to sea level rise. To explore how hurricane-induced changes in salinity affect GHG emissions, we exposed intact soil mesocosms (0-9 cm depth) from a Mid-Atlantic temperate salt marsh to pulse changes in salinity experienced at the site before, during, and after Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Soil temperature, oxygen, and water level were kept constant to avoid confounding effects throughout the experiment. Automated measurements (hourly resolution) of soil GHG emissions were recorded in control (i.e., no salinity changes) and treatment mesocosms, and combined with soil pore water chemistry (i.e., SO42-, S2-, Fe2+, TNb, redox potential, pH) to characterize the biogeochemical responses. Using mixed effects models, we found that the role of different biogeochemical processes, such as sulfur cycling, changed throughout the experiment, underscoring the complex nature of GHG emissions in tidal salt marsh soils. Overall, soils subjected to a salinity decrease had greater GHG emissions than control soils, which were maintained at 17 ppt. The treatment soils had a 24% and 23% increase in global warming potential (20- and 100-year scenarios, respectively) indicating that storm surges can produce pulses of GHG emissions. However, both CH4 and N2O emissions returned to baseline values (following hysteresis responses) when initial conditions were reestablished. The results support the fact that tidal salt marshes are resilient ecosystems, as soil GHG emissions recovered relatively quickly from the pulse event. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of Drying-Rewetting Frequency on Vertical and Lateral Loss of Soil Organic Carbon in a Tidal Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marshes, as "blue carbon" ecosystems, play a critical role in mitigation of global climate change since their large soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Drying-rewetting cycles induced by periodic tides have profound influence on soil carbon cycling in tidal salt marshes. However, the magnitude and mechaanism of the effects of drying-rewetting frequency on SOC loss in tidal salt marshes is still uncertain. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to identify how drying-rewetting frequency changes alter the vertical (CO2 and CH4) and lateral (dissolved organic carbon) carbon losses of soils in a tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We found that increasing soil moisture inhibited CO2 emission but stimulated CH4 emission in a tidal salt marsh. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was produced in the drying phase and rewetting lead to the loss of DOC. Soil moisture and salinity change induced by drying-rewetting cycles were the critical factors controlling vertical organic carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh. DOC had significant effects on CO2 emissions. Changes of tidal action and drying-rewetting cycle induced by global change can affect the pathway of carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planets most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

AB  - This study was conducted in the coastal zone located in Caciliengroden, Jadebusen Bay (North Germany). The aim was to examine the changes in organic matter properties along a salt marsh soil chronosequence. Three soil profiles were located in low, middle-high and high marsh zones, between the mud flat tidal area and the dike. We propose a pattern of spatial changes in properties of salt marsh soils along the studied chronosequence.The results lead to the conclusion that some organic matter properties (C: N, humic to fulvic acid ratios and aromaticity of the humic acids) are good indicators for the extent of development of the studied soils. The lowest values of those indices, typical for aquatic sediments, were related to the initial soils (low marsh) while the highest values were recorded for semi-mature soils (high marsh).

TI  - Dissolved Organic Matter Export from Surface Sediments of a New England Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes sequester a large amount of carbon via sedimentation, but seasonal and climate change impacts on sediment carbon biogeochemistry are not well-understood. This study investigates the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from New England salt marsh sediment seasonally and under possible expected drought conditions. Surface sediment total organic carbon (TOC) values shifted seasonally depending on the overlying dominant plant species suggesting that vegetation and inundation frequency and duration are key factors in sediment TOC fluctuations. Fall sediment samples leached more DOC than summer samples, were compositionally similar to the estuarine water column, and compositionally different from fresh plant matter. Thus, the seasonal TOC pulse incorporated into surface sediments could be a dominant source of DOC to the estuary in the fall and that summer contributions are presumed to be from upstream DOM sources based on optical properties. Sediments leached more DOC under drought than non-drought conditions due to induced cracking in the sediment enhancing organic matter degradation. This study suggests the majority of DOM exported laterally from salt marshes comes from surface sediments (versus plant matter) and that temperature and sea-level rise could affect seasonal and drought pulses of DOC from the marsh.

TI  - Temperature and salinity effects on germination of three Victorian saltbushes (Amaranthaceae)
T2  - Victorian Naturalist (Blackburn)
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of coastal saltmarshes as carbon stores has been documented in a number of recent studies, and the vegetation that inhabits these systems is key to their high functionality. In this study, seeds of three common saltbushes were germinated under various temperature and salinity regimes to determine their sensitivity to conditions commonly associated with climate change. Seeds of Austral Seablight Suaeda australis had the highest germination success in more saline conditions. Germination rate and mean germination success of Seaberry Saltbush Rhagodia candolleana and Berry Saltbush Atriplex semibaccata consistently decreased with increased salinity stress. Atriplex semibaccata and R. candolleana experienced delays in germination in the lowest temperature treatment, and both were significantly affected by the interaction of increasing salinity and temperature. These results suggest that some saltbush species are more likely to persist in coastal systems than others in response to rising atmospheric temperatures and soil salinity as a result of climate change.

TI  - The Carbon Stock and Sequestration Rate in Tidal Flats From Coastal China
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats form around the estuarine and coastal zone by continuous terrigenous sediment transport and deposition processes. Now a large body of published carbon research work frame within the vegetated area (mangrove forests, sea grass bed, and salt marshes). Nonvegetated tidal flats, which are characterized by predominantly silts and clays sediment, were generally impressed with low carbon stock due to their meager primary productivity. However, these regions may be a potentially important carbon sink, given their high burial rate, expanding areal coverage, and detrial organic carbon derived from watershed and adjacent vegetated area. Low carbon densities (<0.01 g cm(-3)) were found in Chinese tidal flat sediments by the study, but the carbon sequestration rates ranged from 35 to 361 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which were comparable to rates of worldwide vegetated coastal areas. The high rates can be ascribed to rapid sedimentation rates (1-2 cm yr(-1)) during the past several decades. The highest areal carbon stocks were located at tidal flat sites proximal to mangrove forests. The majority of carbon stocks (100 cm) was found in the unvegetated tidal flats instead of in the vegetated tidal flats. The former occupied 87% of the entire tidal area, 6.7 times larger than the latter. Tidal flats in coastal China store 78.07 Tg C (100 cm), accounting for nearly 80% of the C deposited in entire coastal tidal area. The future carbon sequestration rates of Chinese tidal flats are facing uncertainties under the pressures of reduced fluvial sediment loads from major rivers.

TI  - Co-occurring Mangroves and Salt Marshes Differ in Microbial Community Composition
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes store large amounts of carbon due to high rates of plant productivity and low organic matter decomposition rates in anoxic soils. As woody mangroves continue to encroach into herbaceous salt marshes, it is important to understand how these wetland biomes differ in soil microbial communities. Mangroves and marsh plants have different rooting structures and chemical qualities and could generate different environments for soil microbes, thus leading to changes in soil carbon processing. In an ecotonal ecosystem in Florida, where mangroves are rapidly encroaching into salt marshes, we compared wetland soil microbial community composition and function in mangrove-dominated vs. salt marsh-dominated plots. Microbial community structure differed between mangrove-dominant and marsh-dominant plots. The top indicator genera in the marsh-dominated plots belonged to putatively anaerobic groups (Tepidibacter, Caldithrix, Desulfovibro, Fibrobacteres, Thiotrichaceae) while top indicator genera in mangrove-dominated plots had representatives within Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Proteobacteria. In a substrate-induced respiration assay, samples from mangrove plots with the greatest root mass also had the highest rate of labile C substrate consumption. Our results suggest that mangroves and marsh plants have different sediment microbial communities and that future mangrove encroachment into salt marshes could alter soil microbial communities with potential implications for soil carbon storage.

TI  - Salt Marsh Plant Community Structure Influences Success of Avicennia germinans During Poleward Encroachment
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the Florida coast, decreasing freeze events are promoting the range shift of the mangrove species Avicennia germinans northward into temperate salt marsh wetlands. Although plant species' ranges are tightly linked with their climatic tolerances, there is considerable variability in the magnitude by which biotic factors like competition and facilitation may also influence range shifts. Changes in mangrove and marsh plant abundance can alter both the above and belowground environment, which may in turn influence ecosystem services typically associated with these systems such as storm surge abatement and carbon storage. Therefore, it is key to understand (1) how the above and belowground environment of established salt marshes influences establishment of mangroves, and (2) how above and belowground environments shift in response to mangrove encroachment. Using a semi-natural mangrove planting experiment, we investigated the impact of four distinct marsh plant community structures (Batis maritima, Spartina alterniflora, mixture of B. maritima and S. alterniflora, mudflat) on mangrove survivorship and decomposition rate. In mixed marsh plots, mangrove survivorship was 42 % higher compared to survivorship in mudflat plots, and decomposition rate was 47 % greater in mixed marsh plots compared to mudflat. However, percent cover of vegetation differed across treatments, and was highest in mixed marsh plots. High survivorship in mixed marsh plots is likely due to increased protection from physical stressors by the dense aboveground cover, and belowground plant root-driven effects such as nutrient availability and oxygen delivery. Our findings suggest that above and below ground differences in salt marsh plant community structure can have an impact on the survival of encroaching mangroves, which may have implications for predicting future mangrove encroachment and improving mangrove restoration techniques.

TI  - Collection, analysis, and age-dating of sediment cores from mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems in Tampa Bay, Florida, 2015
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal wetlands in Tampa Bay, Florida, are important ecosystems that deliver a variety of ecosystem services. Key to ecosystem functioning is wetland response to sea-level rise through accumulation of mineral and organic sediment. The organic sediment within coastal wetlands is composed of carbon sequestered over the time scale of the wetland?s existence. This study was conducted to provide information on soil accretion and carbon storage rates across a variety of coastal ecosystems that was utilized in the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment (ESA, 2017; linkage below). Ten sediment cores were collected from six Tampa Bay wetland sites in October 2015 (maximum core length 40 centimeters). Three main vegetation types were targeted for core collection: salt marsh, dominated by Juncus and Spartina alternaflora; mangrove, including Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and/or Avicennia germinans; and young mangrove, where wetlands were created within the last three decades. An additional surface sediment sample was collected from a salt barren, as this site was not conducive to coring. Marsh surface elevations were measured at each site (ranging from 0.771 meters to 1.462 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the marsh boundaries within current tidal conditions. Continuous Rate of Supply age models, based on lead-210 and cesium-137 isotope analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Over that time, accretion rates were very similar for each ecosystem: restored marsh sites (2.5 mm per year), followed by the salt marshes (2.7 mm per year) and mature mangroves (3.2 mm per year). The resulting carbon burial rates over the past century vary as a function of vegetation type, with mature mangroves burying on average 163 grams carbon per square meter per year, compared to young (restoring) mangroves with an average of 94 grams carbon per square meter per year and the salt marsh with an average of 64 grams carbon per square meter per year . This dataset also includes dry bulk density (0.02 - 1.70 grams per cubic centimeter), percent carbon (0.32 %-39.08 %), and percent loss on ignition (0.66 % - 80.2 %) from a sub-set of core sections in order to assess possible correlative relationships among these parameters. https://estuaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FINAL_Tampa-Bay-Blue-Carbon-Assessment-Report-updated-compressed.pdf.

TI  - Stress-resistance traits disrupt the plant economics-decomposition relationship across environmental gradients in salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how plants respond to environmental gradients and influence ecosystem functions remains a core challenge in ecology. Across species and ecosystems, plants have been shown to coordinate leaf, stem, and root traits along a gradient with optimal resource acquisition or conservation strategies at its extremes, termed the plant economic spectrum (PES), in turn driving ecosystem functioning. PES theory has been successfully applied in coastal wetlands to disentangle how the strong abiotic gradients affect ecosystem functions, such as litter decomposition. Yet, wetlands can be dominated by monospecific stands, and it remains unclear whether the PES applies within species. Here, focusing on a globally widespread salt marsh plant, Spartina anglica, we investigated: a) if the PES holds at the intraspecific level along critical abiotic stress gradients (redox potential and soil salinity); b) how intraspecific changes in plant traits along the PES affect litter decomposition; and c) whether these changes in plant strategies influence the abundance of key macro-detritivores, mediating litter decomposition. We found remarkable variation in S. anglica leaf and stem traits, coordinating along the PES and adopting a conservative strategy under stronger abiotic stress. Unexpectedly, leaves with a conservative strategy (higher leaf dry matter content and C/N ratio) attracted more macro-detritivores and decomposed faster. Other facets of litter quality beyond C/N seem to drive these counter-intuitive effects: leaves with a conservative strategy were likely more palatable because of higher protein content and lower toughness (low total carbohydrate content). Our study highlights that intraspecific trait variability can strongly drive litter decomposition, potentially impacting on the carbon storage capacity of salt marshes; and that specific stress-resistance traits can disrupt the PES - ecosystem function relationship.

TI  - Shoreline change rates in salt marsh units in Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Monitoring shoreline change is of interest in many coastal areas because it enables quantification of land loss over time. Evolution of shoreline position is determined by the balance between erosion and accretion along the coast. In the case of salt marshes, erosion along the water boundary causes a loss of ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, carbon storage, and wave attenuation. In terms of vulnerability, higher shoreline erosion rates indicate higher vulnerability.            This dataset displays shoreline change rates at the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge (EBFNWR), which spans over Great Bay, Little Egg Harbor, and Barnegat Bay in New Jersey, USA. Shoreline change rates are based on Smith and Terrano (2017) analysis of digital vector shorelines acquired from historic topographic sheets, aerial photography, and/or lidar using the AMBUR package (Jackson, 2010). Linear Regression Rates (LRR) of shoreline change were averaged along the shoreline of each salt marsh unit to generate this dataset. Positive and negative values indicate accretion and erosion respectively.As part of the Hurricane Sandy Science Plan, the U.S. Geological Survey is expanding National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards and forecast products to coastal wetlands. The intent is to provide federal, state, and local managers with tools to estimate their vulnerability and ecosystem service potential. For this purpose, the response and resilience of coastal wetlands to physical factors need to be assessed in terms of the ensuing change to their vulnerability and ecosystem services. EBFNWR was selected as a pilot study area.References:Jackson, C.W., Jr., 2010, Basic User Guide for the AMBUR package for R, version 1.0a, http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ambur/.Smith, Kathryn E.

TI  - PRACTICAL PROXIES FOR TIDAL MARSH ECOSYSTEM SERVICES: APPLICATION TO INJURY AND RESTORATION
T2  - ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 54
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Tidal marshes are valued, protected and restored in recognition of their ecosystem services: (1) high productivity and habitat provision supporting the food web leading to fish and wildlife, (2) buffer against storm wave damage, (3) shoreline stabilization, (4) flood water storage, (5) water quality maintenance, (6) biodiversity preservation, (7) carbon storage and (8) socio-economic benefits. Under US law, federal and state governments have joint responsibility for facilitating restoration to compensate quantitatively for ecosystem services lost because of oil spills and other contaminant releases on tidal marshes. This responsibility is now met by choosing and employing metrics (proxies) for the suite of ecosystem services to quantify injury and scale restoration accordingly. Most injury assessments in tidal marshes are triggered by oil spills and are limited to: (1) documenting areas covered by heavy, moderate and light oiling; (2) estimating immediate above-ground production toss (based on stem density and height) of the dominant vascular plants within each oiling intensity category and (3) sampling sediments for chemical analyses and depth of contamination, followed by sediment toxicity assays if sediment contamination is high and likely to persist. The percentage of immediate loss of ecosystem services is then estimated along with the recovery trajectory. Here, we review potential metrics that might refine or replace present metrics for marsh injury assessment. Stratifying plant sampling by the more productive marsh edge versus the less accessible interior would improve resolution of injury and provide greater confidence that restoration is truly compensatory. Using microphytobenthos abundance, cotton-strip decomposition bioassays and other biogeochemical indicators, or sum of production across consumer trophic levels faits as a stand-alone substitute metric. Below-ground plant biomass holds promise as a potential proxy for resiliency but requires further testing. Under some conditions, like chronic contamination by organic pollutants that affect animals but not vascular plants, benthic infaunal density, toxicity testing, and tissue contamination, growth, reproduction and mortality of marsh vertebrates deserve inclusion in the assessment protocol. Additional metrics are sometimes justified to assay microphytobenthos, use by nekton, food and habitat for reptiles, birds and mammals, or support of plant diversity. Empirical research on recovery trajectories in previously injured marshes could reduce the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying cumulative service losses.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planets most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

AB  - Oceans and coasts provide a wide array of services to humans, including climate regulation, food security, and livelihoods. Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as blue' carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

TI  - Relationships Between Soil Composition and Spartina Alterniflora Dieback in an Atlantic Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large scale dieback of Spartina alterniflora poses a threat to salt marsh ecosystem function. Several hypothesized drivers of recent dieback events have been proposed, however, some aspects of salt marsh soil composition and dieback recurrence remain unexplored. We surveyed soil conditions in dieback affected zones and unaffected zones in two marshes on Sapelo Island, Georgia during a drought year to test whether dieback is associated with spatial variations in soil properties such as pH, salinity, water retention and texture. We also surveyed previously documented dieback locations to test whether dieback zones exhibit spatial recurrence. Tidal salt marshes showed significant spatial variability in three physical soil characteristics and exhibited strong associations with zones of S. alterniflora dieback. Sediments in dieback zones had lower silt content, higher bulk density and lower field capacity (a measure of water retention) relative to healthy S. alterniflora stands. Dieback zones also showed patterns of spatial recurrence and similarities with vegetation free areas. These data suggest that the legacy of dieback may be reflected in soils making certain areas susceptible to further dieback during drought periods.

TI  - Beyond burial: lateral exchange is a significant atmospheric carbon sink in mangrove forests
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O, and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of methane offset burial by approximately 6%, while the nitrous oxide sink was approximately 0.5% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.

TI  - Climate and plant controls on soil organic matter in coastal wetlands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth. Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change. Collectively, our results indicate that future changes in SOM and plant productivity, regulated by cascading effects of precipitation on freshwater availability and salinity, could impact wetland stability and affect the supply of some wetland ecosystem services.

TI  - Sources of organic carbon in mangrove sediments: variability and possible ecological implications
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove sediments from three different mangrove ecosystems (Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Godavari Delta, Andhra Pradesh, India, and Galle and Pambala, south-west Sri Lanka) were analysed for their organic carbon content, elemental ratios (C:N) and carbon stable isotope composition. Organic carbon content (0.6 - 31.7% dry weight), C/N ratios (7.0 - 27.3) and delta(13)C (between -29.4 and -20.6parts per thousand) showed a wide range of values. Lower stocks of organic carbon coincided with low C/N (atom) ratios and less negative delta(13)C values, indicating import of marine or estuarine particulate suspended matter. High organic carbon stocks coincided with high C/N ratios and delta(13)C values close, but not equal, to those of the mangrove vegetation. The variations observed in this study and published literature data could be adequately described by a simple two-end mixing model, whereby marine/estuarine suspended matter and mangrove litter were taken as end members. Thus, while in some mangrove ecosystems or vegetation zones, organic carbon stocks can be very high and are almost entirely of mangrove origin, there also appear to be cases in which deposited estuarine or marine suspended matter is the dominant source of organic carbon and nitrogen in mangrove sediments. This situation is remarkably similar to that observed in temperate salt marsh ecosystems where the importance of local vascular plant production to the sediment organic carbon pool is equally variable. The observed high variability in organic matter origin is thought to have a major impact on the overall carbon dynamics in intertidal mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon Sources in the Sediments of a Restoring vs. Historically Unaltered Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide the important ecosystem service of carbon storage in their sediments; however, little is known about the sources of such carbon and whether they differ between historically unaltered and restoring systems. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to quantify carbon sources in a restoring, sparsely vegetated marsh (Restoring) and an adjacent, historically unaltered marsh (Reference) in the Nisqually River Delta (NRD) of Washington, USA. Three sediment cores were collected at "Inland" and "Seaward" locations at both marshes similar to 6 years after restoration. Benthic diatoms, C3 plants, C4 plants, and particulate organic matter (POM) were collected throughout the NRD. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of sources and sediments were used in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to determine the contribution of each carbon source to the sediments of both marshes. Autochthonous marsh C3 plants contributed 73 +/- 10% (98 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 89 +/- 11% (119 g C m(-2) year(-1)) to Reference-Inland and Reference-Seaward sediment carbon sinks, respectively. In contrast, the sediment carbon sink at the Restoring Marsh received a broad assortment of predominantly allochthonous materials, which varied in relative contribution based on source distance and abundance. Marsh POM contributed the most to Restoring-Seaward (42 +/- 34%) (69 g C m(-2) year(-1)) followed by Riverine POM at Restoring-Inland (32 +/- 41%) (52 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Overall, this study demonstrates that largely unvegetated, restoring marshes can accumulate carbon by relying predominantly on allochthonous material, which comes mainly from the most abundant and closest estuarine sources.

TI  - Harnessing Positive Species Interactions to Enhance Coastal Wetland Restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They generate critical services for humans including shoreline protection, carbon storage, pollution mitigation, and fisheries production. Restoration of coastal wetlands has historically been viewed as a secondary conservation strategy, but recently-given the continued loss of wetlands worldwide-many non-governmental and governmental organizations have elevated habitat restoration to be a primary method for wetland conservation. The long-held paradigm in coastal wetland restoration has been to restore target habitats by reducing physical stressors and avoiding competition among outplants, such as mangrove saplings or Spartina plugs. Recent ecological research, however, reveals that positive species interactions, such as facilitation, are critical to wetland recovery after disturbance. Here, we review the scientific evidence for the importance of positive species interactions in the recovery of salt-marsh and mangrove ecosystems and assess the extent to which they have been integrated into restoration studies. We found that only a small proportion of studies of marsh and mangrove restoration examined the effects of positive species interactions, despite the important role they play in the regrowth of coastal wetlands. We outline how positive species interactions can be systematically incorporated into future restoration work and discuss how this incorporation can help the reestablishment of coastal wetland biota through: (1) trophic facilitation, (2) stress reduction, and (3) associational defenses. The absence of positive interactions in restoration designs may partially explain the significant disparities between the functioning of natural and restored coastal plant ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planets most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

TI  - Coastal vegetation invasion increases greenhouse gas emission from wetland soils but also increases soil carbon accumulation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil properties and soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from four coastal wetlands were studied throughout the year, namely, native Kandelia obovata mangrove forest vs. exotic Sonneratia apetala mangrove forest, and native Cyperus malaccensis salt marsh vs. exotic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Soils of the four wetlands were all net sources of greenhouse gases while Sonneratia forest contributed the most with a total soil-atmosphere CO2-equivalent flux of 137.27 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), which is 69.23%, 99.75% and 44.56% higher than that of Kandelia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively. The high underground biomass and distinctive root structure of Sonneratia might be responsible for its high greenhouse gas emission from the soil. Soils in Spartina marsh emitted the second largest amount of total greenhouse gases but it ranked first in emitting trace greenhouse gases. Annual average CH4 and N2O fluxes from Spartina soil were 13.77 and 1.14 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which are 2.08 and 1.46 times that of Kandelia, 1.03 and 1.15 times of Sonneratia, and 1.74 and 1.02 times of Cyperus, respectively. Spartina has longer growing season and higher productivity than native marshes which might increase greenhouse gas emission in cold seasons. Exotic wetland soils had higher carbon stock as compared to their respective native counterparts but their carbon stocks were offset by a larger proportion because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions. Annual total soil-atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases reduced soil carbon burial benefits by 8.1%, 9.5%, 6.4% and 7.2% for Kandelia, Sonneratia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively, which narrowed down the gaps in net soil carbon stock between native and exotic wetlands. The results indicated that the invasion of exotic wetland plants might convert local coastal soils into a considerable atmospheric source of greenhouse gases although they at the same time increase soil carbon accumulation.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of organic-matter decay in tidal marshes
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately half of marine carbon sequestration takes place in coastal wetlands, including tidal marshes, where organic matter contributes to soil elevation and ecosystem persistence in the face of sea-level rise. The long-term viability of marshes and their carbon pools depends, in part, on how the balance between productivity and decay responds to climate change. Here, we report the sensitivity of labile soil organic-matter decay in tidal marshes to seasonal and latitudinal variations in temperature measured over a 3-year period. We find a moderate increase in decay rate at warmer temperatures (3-6% per degrees C, Q(10) = 1.3-1.5). Despite the profound differences between microbial metabolism in wetlands and uplands, our results indicate a strong conservation of temperature sensitivity. Moreover, simple comparisons with organic-matter production suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 and warmer temperatures will accelerate carbon accumulation in marsh soils, and potentially enhance their ability to survive sea-level rise.

T2  - BOTANICA MARINA
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning including seaweed communities - in the territorial waters of the UK and its Overseas Territories are facing unprecedented pressures. Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy. Marine biodiversity provides crucial goods and services. Climate change and biodiversity loss pose new challenges for legislation. In particular, there are implications of climate change for the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas and natural carbon storage by marine systems to help control the global climate system. The UK currently has legal obligations to protect biodiversity under international and European law.

TI  - Salinity affects topsoil organic carbon concentrations through regulating vegetation structure and productivity
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Estuarine salt marshes have been recognized as one of the most efficient carbon sinks in the biosphere, with considerable potential for climate change mitigation. However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied respectively by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon concentration.      This dataset consists of two tables listed below.

TI  - Controls on soil organic carbon stocks in tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.

TI  - Nitrogen addition differently alters GHGs production and soil microbial community of tidal salt marsh soil depending on the types of halophyte
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate tidal salt marshes are an important carbon sink. They store 44.7 Tg C and only emit low amounts of greenhouse gases. Although recent studies have suggested that environmental changes such as eutrophication and plant invasion may alter their methane and nitrous oxide emissions, the exact consequences and dynamics are not yet fully understood. We hypothesize that the greenhouse gas emission responses from nitrogen addition differs depending on halophyte types. In this study, we conducted soil incubation experiments with different halophyte and nitrogen amendments. We found that nitrogen addition significantly enhanced methane emissions from bare tidal flats (45%) and Suaeda japonica marshes (3500%), which normally have low plant biomass nitrogen input. The main contributors to this change were the increased abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and decreased relative abundance of sulfate to methanogen reducers (dsrA/mcrA). These results suggest that the effects of nitrogen addition on methane emission stimulation may be substantial for specific types of tidal marshes. They further suggests that improper nitrogen input management and the consequent eutrophication may cause a dramatic rise in methane emissions.

Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration and storage in coastal habitats
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal margin habitats are globally significant in terms of their capacity to sequester and store carbon, but their continuing decline, due to environmental change and human land use decisions, is reducing their capacity to provide this ecosystem service. In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Terrestrial laser scanning to quantify above-ground biomass of structurally complex coastal wetland vegetation
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass represents a small yet significant contributor to carbon storage in coastal wetlands. Despite this, above-ground biomass is often poorly quantified, particularly in areas where vegetation structure is complex. Traditional methods for providing accurate estimates involve harvesting vegetation to develop mangrove allometric equations and quantify saltmarsh biomass in quadrats. However broad scale application of these methods may not capture structural variability in vegetation resulting in a loss of detail and estimates with considerable uncertainty. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) collects high resolution three-dimensional point clouds capable of providing detailed structural morphology of vegetation. This study demonstrates that TLS is a suitable non-destructive method for estimating biomass of structurally complex coastal wetland vegetation. We compare volumetric models, 3-D surface reconstruction and rasterised volume, and point cloud elevation histogram modelling techniques to estimate biomass. Our results show that current volumetric modelling approaches for estimating TLS-derived biomass are comparable to traditional mangrove allometrics and saltmarsh harvesting. However, volumetric modelling approaches oversimplify vegetation structure by under utilising the large amount of structural information provided by the point cloud. The point cloud elevation histogram model presented in this study, as an alternative to volumetric modelling, utilises all of the information within the point cloud, as opposed to sub-sampling based on specific criteria. This method is simple but highly effective for both mangrove (r(2) = 0.95) and saltmarsh (r(2) > 0.92) vegetation. Our results provide evidence that application of TB in coastal wetlands is an effective non-destructive method to accurately quantify biomass for structurally complex vegetation.

TI  - An Assessment of the Tea Bag Index Method as a Proxy for Organic Matter Decomposition in Intertidal Environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal wetlands capture and store carbon (C) for long periods of time, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Yet the processes, which govern the decomposition and subsequent long-term storage of organic matter (OM) and C in these habitats, remain poorly understood. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) uses a standardized OM (green and Rooibos tea) and has the potential to shed light on OM decomposition across habitats, including saltmarshes. Here, we apply the TBI method at two saltmarshes within the same estuary with the aim of (i) reducing the influence of climatic variables and (ii) determining the role of the environment, including the soil characteristics, in the decomposition of OM. We extended the standard (3 months) incubation period over a full year in order to investigate the longer-term decomposition processes at each site. The initial results partially support previous studies that the early stages of decomposition (leaching of the water-soluble fraction) is governed by climatic conditions, but may be further enhanced by tidal flushing in saltmarshes. By extending the incubation period, we observed the initiation of midstage OM decomposition (cellulose degradation) upon which the soil characteristics appear to be the dominant control. These results highlight the importance of long-term TBI incubations to understand early-stage OM decomposition. The relationship between tea mass (OM) loss and C loss in these intertidal environments is not straightforward, and we would caution the use of the TBI as a direct universal proxy for soil C degradation in such intertidal wetlands.

TI  - A novel UAV-based approach for biomass prediction and grassland structure assessment in coastal meadows
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal meadows provide a wide range of ecosystem services worldwide. In order to better target conservation efforts in these ecosystems, it is necessary to develop highly accurate models that account for the spatial nature of ecosystem structure, processes and functions. In this study, above-ground biomass was predicted at very high spatial resolution in nine study sites in Estonia. A combination of UAV-derived datasets were used to produce vegetation indices and micro topographic models. A random forest algorithm was used to generate above-ground biomass maps and assess the contribution of each predictor variable. The model successfully predicted above-ground biomass at very high accuracies. Additionally, grassland structural heterogeneity was assessed using UAV-derived datasets and vegetation indices. The results were subsequently related to management history at each study site, showing that continuous, monospecific grazing management tends to simplify grassland structure, which could in turn reduce the supply of a key regulation and maintenance ecosystem services: nursery and reproduction habitat for waders. These results also indicate that UAV-based surveys can serve as reliable grassland monitoring tools and could aid in the development of site-specific management strategies.

TI  - Blue carbon: past, present and future, with emphasis on macroalgae
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon did not originally include macroalgal ecosystems; however evidence is mounting that macroalgal ecosystems function in marine carbon sequestration. The great majority of present day marine macroalgal net primary productivity (NPP) involves haptophytic algae on eroding shores. For these organisms the long-term storage of particulate organic carbon involves export from the site of production of biomass that has evaded parasites and grazers, and that some of the exported biomass is sedimented and stored rather than being mineralized en route by detritivores (microbes and fauna). Export from eroding shores, and subsequent storage, of haptophytic marine macroalgal particulate organic carbon could have started by 1.6 Ga. Storage on depositing shores close to the site of NPP by rhizophytic macroalgae and then by rhizophytic coastal seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves began not less than 209 Ma ago. Future increases in surface ocean temperatures may bring tropical marine macroalgae to their upper temperature limit, while temperate marine macroalgae will migrate poleward, in both cases assuming that temperature increases faster than genetic adaptation to higher temperature. Increased CO2 in the surface ocean will generally favour uncalcified over calcified marine macroalgae. This results in decreased CO2 release from decreased calcification, as well as decreased ballasting by CaCO3 of exported particulate organic carbon resulting in decreasing sedimentation. While much more work is needed, the available information suggests that macroalgae play a significant role in marine organic carbon storage.

TI  - The first national scale evaluation of organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates of coastal sediments along the West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon science requires the estimates of organic carbon stock and sequestration rate; however, holistic data analysis remains limited in South Korea. The present study reports current organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the coastal areas of West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea, encompassing entire intertidal areas using long-term field survey combined with remote sensing technology. Twenty-one intertidal flats were targeted across seven provinces (Gyeonggi, Chungnam, Jeonbuk, Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, Gyeongbuk, Gangwon). Out of the evaluated environmental parameters, mud content represented a significant factor controlling sedimentary organic carbon stocks across target areas, and was significantly positively correlated to the total organic carbon (p < 0.05). Organic carbon stocks measured in salt marshes (i.e., upper intertidal zone) reflected the high carbon fixation capacity of halophytes through primary production. Sediment textural type was classified using analysis of remotely sensed imagery, and was closely correlated to field-based classification data (p < 0.05). Using field and remote sensing results, we estimated total organic carbon stocks (13,142,149 Mg C) and sequestration rates (71,383 Mg C yr(-1)) in the tidal flats of South Korea. This study presents the first report on blue carbon potential in the Korean tidal flats, providing baseline information on the carbon dynamics of intertidal sediments in this region and, potentially, elsewhere.

TI  - Interacting Effects of Plant Invasion, Climate, and Soils on Soil Organic Carbon Storage in Coastal Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland soils store large amounts of organic carbon, which is becoming vulnerable to environmental changes such as exotic species invasion and climate change. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.

TI  - Mangrove growth response to experimental warming is greatest near the range limit in northeast Florida
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrubs are invading into grasslands around the world, but we don't yet know how these shrubs will fare in a warmer future. In ecotonal coastal wetland ecosystems, woody mangroves are encroaching into herbaceous salt marshes owing to changes in temperature, precipitation, and sediment dynamics. Increasing mangrove biomass in wetlands often increases carbon storage, which is high in these productive ecosystems, but little is known about how mangrove growth will change in response to warming. To address this knowledge gap, we deployed warming experiments at three coastal wetland sites along a latitudinal gradient in northeast Florida where Avicennia germinans, black mangroves, are encroaching into salt marshes. We achieved air temperature warming (+1.6 degrees C during the day) at all three sites and measured stem elongation, canopy height and area changes, and leaf and node number. After 2 yr of warming, we found that mangrove growth rate in height increased due to warming. Warming increased stem elongation by 130% over unwarmed control plots after 1 yr at the northern site. Mangrove growth in canopy area did not respond to warming. Site differences in growth rate were pronounced, and mangrove growth in both height and area were lowest at the northern site, despite greater impacts of warming at that site. We also found that area-based relative growth rate was five times higher across all treatments than height-based relative growth rate, indicating that mangroves are growing wider rather than taller in these ecotonal environments. Our findings indicate that the growth effect of experimental warming depends on site characteristics and growth parameter measured. We also propose that differential mangrove growth across the three sites may be driven by biotic factors such as the identity of the salt marsh species into which mangroves are encroaching. Our results suggest that, as seen in other ecosystems, wetland plants may respond most strongly to warming at their poleward range edge.

TI  - The Role of the Upper Tidal Estuary in Wetland Blue Carbon Storage and Flux
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) standing stocks, C mass balance, and soil C burial in tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) and TFFW transitioning to low-salinity marshes along the upper estuary are not typically included in blue carbon accounting, but may represent a significant C sink. Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planets most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions.

TI  - Limits on carbon sequestration in arid blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

TI  - The effect of ocean acidification on carbon storage and sequestration in seagrass beds; a global and UK context
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean acidification will have many negative consequences for marine organisms and ecosystems, leading to a decline in many ecosystem services provided by the marine environment. This study reviews the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on seagrasses, assessing how this may affect their capacity to sequester carbon in the future and providing an economic valuation of these changes. If ocean acidification leads to a significant increase in above- and below-ground biomass, the capacity of seagrass to sequester carbon will be significantly increased. The associated value of this increase in sequestration capacity is approximately 500 and 600 billion globally between 2010 and 2100. A proportionally similar increase in carbon sequestration value was found for the UK. This study highlights one of the few positive stories for ocean acidification and underlines that sustainable management of seagrasses is critical to avoid their continued degradation and loss of carbon sequestration capacity.

TI  - Freshwater input structures soil properties, vertical accretion, and nutrient accumulation of Georgia and U.S. tidal marshes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify relationships between freshwater input and marsh soil properties, measurements of bulk density, nutrients (carbon [C], nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P]), accretion, and accumulation were compared in tidal marshes of three estuaries of Georgia that varied in delivery of freshwater. Soil organic C and N (0-30 cm) were two times greater in marshes of the freshwater-dominated Altamaha River than in the salt marshes of Doboy Sound and Sapelo River. Cs-137 accretion and accumulation of organic C and N were three to five times greater in freshwater-dominated marshes than in salt marshes. The patterns observed in Georgia marshes were geographically general; data for tidal freshwater and brackish marsh soils compiled from 61 studies in the conterminous United States showed lower bulk density and higher percent organic C and N than salt marshes, regardless of geographic region. Salinity, a proxy for freshwater input, was inversely correlated with percent soil organic C and N and with vertical accretion in Georgia marshes and in marshes elsewhere in the conterminous United States. There was no relationship between above- or belowground emergent plant production and salinity of Georgia marshes but the rate of root decomposition was positively related to salinity, and decomposition rate was negatively related to percent soil organic C and C accumulation. In Georgia tidal marshes and elsewhere, soil organic matter content and accumulation are mediated by freshwater through its effects on decomposition.

TI  - Influence of the Wax Lake Delta sediment diversion on aboveground plant productivity and carbon storage in deltaic island and mainland coastal marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal Louisiana is experiencing a significant loss of coastal wetland area due to increasing sea level rise, subsidence, sediment starvation and marsh collapse. The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of the change in vegetation structure on the ecological functions of salt marshes: the example of the Yangtze estuary
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes worldwide are faced with threats from rising sea levels and coastal development. We measured changes in salt marsh vegetation structure using remote sensing and its consequences for carbon sequestration, wave attenuation, and sediment trapping ability using remotely sensed imaging, field measurement data, and the published literature data pertaining to the Yangtze Estuary, a rapidly urbanizing area in Eastern China. From 1980 to 2010, the total area of vegetated salt marsh decreased by 17 %, but the vegetation structure changed more dramatically, with the ratio of Phragmites/Spartina/Scirpus changing from 24:0:76, to 77:0:23, 44:13:43, and 33:39:28 in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. Carbon sequestration increased slightly from 1980 to 2010, with the dramatic shifts in plant species composition. The total length of seawall inadequately protected by salt marsh vegetation increased from 44 km in 1980 to 300 km in 2010. Sediment accretion increased (from 8 to 14 million m(3)/year) due to the spread of Spartina, which to some extent compensated the loss of total vegetated area in the salt marsh. Changes in the delivery of functions were not linearly related to the change in the area of vegetated salt marsh, but more from the combined effect of changing vegetation structure, sediment input, and land reclamation. Under threat of sea-level rise, protection and maintenance of vegetation structure outside the seawall are of great importance for the safe economic development inside the seawall.

TI  - Arsenic and heavy metal pollution in wetland soils from tidal freshwater and salt marshes before and after the flow-sediment regulation regime in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil samples were collected in tidal freshwater and salt marshes in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), northern China, before and after the flow-sediment regulation. Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

TI  - Blue carbon stocks and exchanges along the California coast
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes and seagrass meadows can sequester and store high quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments relative to other marine and terrestrial habitats. Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast. In the top 20 cm of sediment, the salt marshes contained approximately twice as much OC as seagrass meadows did, 4.92 +/- 0.36 kg OC m(-2) compared to 2.20 +/- 0.24 kg OC m(-2), respectively. Both salt marsh and seagrass sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and US-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and/or C-3 salt marsh plants.

TI  - Impacts of the rhizosphere effect and plant species on organic carbon mineralization rates and pathways, and bacterial community composition in a tidal marsh
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing recognition regarding the carbon cycle in the rhizosphere of upland ecosystems, little is known regarding the rhizosphere effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization in tidal marsh soils. In the current study, in situ rhizobox experiments (including rhizosphere and inner and outer bulk soil) were conducted in an estuarine tidal marsh. Our results showed that a higher abundance of total bacteria, Geobacter, dsrA and mcrA and lower a-diversity were observed in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil. Rhizosphere effects shifted the partition of terminal metabolic pathways from sulfate reduction in the bulk soil to the co-dominance of microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction in the rhizosphere. Although the rhizosphere effect promoted the rates of three terminal metabolic pathways, it showed greater preference towards microbial Fe(III) reduction in the tidal marsh soils. Plant species had little impact on the partitioning of terminal metabolic pathways, but did affect the potential of total SOC mineralization together with the abundance and diversity of total bacteria. Both the rhizosphere effect and plant species influenced the bacterial community composition in the tidal marsh soils; however, plant species had a less pronounced impact on the bacterial community compared with that of the rhizosphere effect.

TI  - Methylococcaceae are the dominant active aerobic methanotrophs in a Chinese tidal marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although coastal marshes are net carbon sinks, they are net methane sources. Aerobic methanotrophs in coastal marsh soils are important methane consumers, but their activity and populations are poorly characterized. DNA stable-isotope probing followed by sequencing was used to determine how active methanotrophic populations differed in the main habitats of a Chinese coastal marsh. These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50-70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a significant correlation between the active bacterial communities and soil properties (salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and available phosphorus). Importantly, these results highlight how changing vegetation or soil features in coastal marshes may change their resident active methanotrophic populations, which will further influence methane cycling.

TI  - The geomorphic impact of mangrove encroachment in an Australian salt marsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are encroaching into salt marshes throughout the world as a result of environmental change. Previous studies suggest mangroves trap sediment more efficiently than adjacent salt marshes, providing mangroves greater capacity to adapt to sea level rise; this may occur by displacing salt marshes. However, sediment transport in adjacent marsh-mangrove systems and its role in mangrove encroachment upon salt marsh remain poorly understood. Here we directly test the hypothesis that mangroves reduce the ability of adjacent marsh to adjust to sea level rise by measuring sediment transport across salt marsh platforms, with and without 6 m of fringing mangroves at the tidal creek edge. We find that salt marshes and mangroves have equivalent sediment trapping efficiencies along the wetland edge. Suspended sediment concentrations, mass accumulation rates, and long-term accretion rates are not lower in salt marshes landward of mangroves than salt marshes without fringing mangroves. Therefore, our work suggests that a relatively narrow zone of mangroves does not impact salt marsh accretion, and activities that limit mangrove encroachment into salt marsh, such as removal of seedlings, will not improve the capacity of salt marsh to trap sediments.

TI  - Denitrification of soil nitrogen in coastal and inland salt marshes with different flooding frequencies
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Denitrification is an important process for removing nitrogen in wetlands, and it is influenced by many environmental factors. However, little information is available on the relationship between hydrologic conditions and denitrification. In this study three typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including short-term flooding wetlands (STFW), seasonal-flooding wetlands (SFW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) were chosen as the study sites in the Yellow River Delta. In contrast, five typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including 100-year floodplain (H), 10-year floodplain (T), 5-year floodplain (F), 1-year floodplain (O) and permanently flooded floodplain (B) were chosen as the study sites in Xianghai wetlands. This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes. Generally, higher flooding frequencies will cause higher denitrification rates in salt marshes. Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes. Therefore, the changes in soil properties (e.g. SOM, TN, pH and salinity) can become an important way to control NO3- levels in inland salt marshes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Native and non-native halophytes resiliency against sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the independent impacts of flooding salinity, flooding depth, and flooding frequency on the native species, Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, and on the invasive species Spartina alterniflora in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Total biomass of all three species decreased significantly with increasing salinity, but S. alterniflora was less severely affected than P. australis and S. mariqueter. Elevated flooding depth significantly decreased their live aboveground biomass of P. australis and S. mariqueter, while S. alterniflora still had high live aboveground biomass and total biomass even at the highest flooding depth. These findings indicated that S. alterniflora was more tolerant to experimental conditions than the two native species, and an unavoidable suggestion is the expansion of this non-native species in relation to the native counterparts in future scenarios of increased sea-level and saltwater intrusion. Even so, environmental stresses might lead to significant decreases in total biomass and live aboveground biomass of all three species, which would potentially weaken their ability to trap sediments and accumulate organic matter. However, the relatively high belowground-to-aboveground biomass ratio indicated phenotypic plasticity in response to stressful environmental conditions, which suggest that marsh species can adapt to sea-level rise and maintain marsh elevation.

TI  - The effect of nutrient-rich effluents from shrimp farming on mangrove soil carbon storage and geochemistry under semi-arid climate conditions in northern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-arid mangrove estuary system in the northeast Brazilian coast (Ceara state) was selected for this study to (i) evaluate the impact of shrimp farm nutrient-rich wastewater effluents on the soil geochemistry and organic carbon (OC) storage and (ii) estimate the total amount of OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm). Wastewater-affected mangrove forests were referred to as WAM and undisturbed areas as Non-WAM. Redox conditions and DC content were statistically correlated (P < 0.05) with seasonality and type of land use (WAM vs. Non-WAM). Eh values were from anoxic to oxic conditions in the wet season (from -5 to 68 mV in WAM and from <40 to >400 mV in Non-WAM soils) and significantly higher (from 66 to 411 mV) in the dry season (P < 0.01). OC contents (0-40 cm soil depth) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the wet season than the dry season, and higher in Non-WAM soils than in WAM soils (values of 8.1 and 6.7 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for Non-WAM, and values of 3.8 and 2.9 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for WAM soils; P < 0.01). Iron partitioning was significantly dependent (P < 0.05) on type of land use, with a smaller degree of pyritization and lower Fe-pyrite presence in WAM soils compared to Non-WAM soils. Basal respiration of soil sediments was significantly influenced (P < 0.01) by type of land use with highest CO2 flux rates measured in the WAM soils (mean values of 0.20 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1) C vs. 0.04 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1), C). The OC storage reduction in WAM soils was potentially caused (i) by an increase in microbial activity induced by loading of nutrient-rich effluents and (ii) by an increase of strong electron acceptors [e.g., NO3-] that promote a decrease in pyrite concentration and hence a reduction in soil OC burial. The current estimated OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm) in the state of Ceara is approximately 1 million t. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In semiarid Sahelian region, the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and water are key to sustainable land management. This work focuses on the behaviour of carbon. A total of 33 soil profiles in four polders, ranging from 10 to 65 years in age, were sampled, analysed (01 m), and matched with marsh soil profiles in recent sediments considered as reference (t(0)) for carbon stocks determination. SOC and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks show a spatial variability between polders. SOC stocks were t(0) 200 +/- 0.8; t(60) 183 +/- 34; and t(65) 189 +/- 1.1 MgC.ha(-1), whereas the SIC stocks were negligible. These results show the highest stocks of soil carbon observed for this climatic region. The SOC stocks were also calculated for the equivalent soil mass at a defined depth (00.3 m); the corrected calculation of SOC stocks (S-corr) for 2450 Mg.ha(-1) of equivalent soil mass is t(0) 64 +/- 1.9, t(60) 59 +/- 9.8, and t(65) 53 +/- 2.2 MgC.ha(-1); the stocks decrease by -7.8% and -17.2% from t0 to t60 and t65. Carbon was inherited from the pre-existing.marsh and the polders have conserved high stock values. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Academie des sciences.

TI  - Above- to Belowground Vegetation Biomass Ratio in Temperate North-East Atlantic Saltmarshes Increases Strongly with Soil Nitrogen Gradient
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes provide a broad range of ecosystem services, but have been degraded globally and are further threatened by sea-level rise. Changes in biomass partitioning between above- and belowground components of plant community biomass as a consequence of nutrient enrichment can impact those services profoundly. However, the evidence for such impacts is largely confined to North America, leaving a gap in global understanding of coastal ecosystem resilience. Using field surveys across 15 saltmarshes along the south and east coasts of Ireland, we tested whether aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) plant biomass allocation across all plant assemblages combined and within individual plant assemblages is related to soil nutrients. AG biomass and AG/BG biomass ratio were positively related, and BG biomass was negatively related to NOx-, both across all assemblages combined and within individual assemblages. AG biomass and AG/BG ratio were also positively related to NH4+ within individual assemblages, but not across all of them combined. The relationships between biomass and labile P were weaker, and their direction varied across the whole P gradient and among individual assemblages. These findings demonstrate broad, community-wide links between biomass allocation and soil nutrients in saltmarshes. The up to 6.6-fold increase in AG/BG biomass ratio along the N gradient, coupled with differential responses among functionally contrasting plants, could have significant implications for multiple saltmarsh functions such as energy fixation for consumers, wave attenuation, sediment binding and carbon storage. Improved understanding of the underlying causalities would help promoting saltmarsh resilience.

AB  - Salt marshes and seagrass meadows can sequester and store high quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments relative to other marine and terrestrial habitats. Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the Pacific coast of California. The salt marshes studied here contained approximately twice as much OC as did seagrass meadows, 23.51  1.77 kg OC m-3 compared to 11.01  1.18 kg OC m-3, respectively. Both seagrass and salt marsh sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and U.S.-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and C3 salt marsh plants. See manuscript.

TI  - The effect of biomass variations of Spartina alterniflora on the organic carbon content and composition of a salt marsh in northern Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship of the organic carbon content and surface sediment composition to the litter mass of Spartina alterniflora was analyzed to investigate the responses of organic carbon content and composition to biomass changes in a salt marsh after the introduction of S. alterniflora. The vertical distribution of sediment organic carbon and its relationship with S. alterniflora underground biomass was also examined. The results show that the total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant carbon (RC) and labile carbon (LC) contents were significantly greater in the surface sediments of the S. alterniflora flat, which showed different intra-annual variation trends compared to a bare flat. In particular, the majority of S. alterniflora-derived organic carbon was LC in the S. alterniflora flat sediments, indicating that the introduction of S. alterniflora resulted in a significant increase in surface sediment LC content. In addition, the results of S. alterniflora litter decomposition revealed a rapid decrease of 40% in the organic carbon stocks within the first 2 months, and the TOC and LC contents showed intra-annual variation trends similar to the surface litter mass but with a two-month "phase difference" in time. Further analysis indicated, S. alterniflora litter controlled the content and proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived TOC input, and it ultimately affected the TOC content variations in the sediments. However, due to the LC mainly originated from S. alterniflora, the surface litter exerted more significant impact on the variation of LC content. In the bare flat core, the relatively low TOC, RC and LC content values were significantly influenced by the grain control effect, and the origins of these components were mainly derived from non-S. alterniflora sources. However, in the S. alterniflora flat cores, the relationships between organic carbon content, grain size and underground biomass, together with the analysis of the organic carbon origins, indicated that the S. alterniflora underground biomass significantly affected the origin of organic carbon. In addition, Spartina alterniflora introduction significantly increased the carbon sequestration capacity of the tidal salt marsh in North Jiangsu. Furthermore, the TOC, LC and RC accumulation rate analyses also indicated that S. alterniflora introduction improved the salt marsh soil and was beneficial to long-term carbon sequestration of the organic carbon pool.

TI  - Differences in crab burrowing and halophyte growth by habitat types in a Korean salt marsh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crabs and halophytes are important indicators of soil composition and fertility in salt marsh ecosystems. Many previous studies have examined the effects of crab excavation on soil properties, but little is known about the combined effects of crabs and halophytes on salt marsh soils. The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution of halophytes and crabs in a macrotidal salt marsh, and to determine effects of the combination of crabs and halophytes on the physicochemical properties of soils. Vegetation structure and soil properties in relation to seed dispersion distance and habitat type were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Cluster Analysis (CA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Plant biomass and height of individual marsh plants tended to be higher at distances > 1 m from stands of parent plants. Crabs preferred habitats with high vegetation cover. Low densities of burrowing crabs and halophytes also caused considerable changes in soil properties. The combination of crabs and halophytes increased the spatial variability of physicochemical parameters in these salt marsh soils. Thus these combinations may be important to a complete understanding of plant distribution and soil nutrient cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - The impact of man-made earthen barriers on the physical structure of New England tidal marshes (USA)
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In New England salt marshes, man-made earthen barriers, or berms, are generally historic, small-scale (average height = 0.71 m +/- A 0.12 SE; average length = 166 m +/- A 41 SE) tidal restrictions which originated from past agricultural, industrial, and environmental practices. The orientation and size depends primarily on the original purpose of the barrier, but this study examines the effects of berms oriented parallel to the incoming tide such that some landward portion of the marsh receives a different tidal signal than the seaward portion. Our hypotheses considered the impacts of the altered hydrology on pore water chemistry and edaphic characteristics. The results indicate that the effect of berms on salt marsh physical structure varies significantly by site. Where the tidal flooding frequency is restricted and drainage is poor, the landward marsh shows pool development, high salinity and sulfide concentrations, and low vegetation cover. In contrast, where tidal flooding is inhibited but the marsh soils are well-drained, salinity and sulfide concentrations decrease and accelerated decomposition results in subsidence and reduced soil organic matter. Given these findings, impacts from berms may impair salt marsh function and resilience to invasive plants and sea level rise.

TI  - Coastal wetlands mitigate storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As storm-driven coastal flooding increases under climate change, wetlands such as saltmarshes are held as a nature-based solution. Yet evidence supporting wetlands' storm protection role in estuaries-where both waves and upstream surge drive coastal flooding-remains scarce. Here we address this gap using numerical hydrodynamic models within eight contextually diverse estuaries, simulating storms of varying intensity and coupling flood predictions to damage valuation. Saltmarshes reduced flooding across all studied estuaries and particularly for the largest-100 year-storms, for which they mitigated average flood extents by 35% and damages by 37% ($8.4 M). Across all storm scenarios, wetlands delivered mean annual damage savings of $2.7 M per estuary, exceeding annualised values of better studied wetland services such as carbon storage. Spatial decomposition of processes revealed flood mitigation arose from both localised wave attenuation and estuary-scale surge attenuation, with the latter process dominating: mean flood reductions were 17% in the sheltered top third of estuaries, compared to 8% near wave-exposed estuary mouths. Saltmarshes therefore play a generalised role in mitigating storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries via multi-scale processes. Ecosystem service modelling must integrate processes operating across scales or risk grossly underestimating the value of nature-based solutions to the growing threat of storm-driven coastal flooding.

TI  - Characterization of humic substances in salt marsh soils under sea rush (Juncus maritimus)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Humic substances (HS) from salt marsh soils were characterized and the relationships among HS composition and some geochemical factors were analysed. For this, three salt marshes with the same vegetation cover (Juncus maritimus), but with different geochemical characteristics, were selected. The qualitative characterization of the soil humic acids and fulvic acids was carried out by elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and VACP/MAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy.HS from salt marsh soils under sea rush (Juncus maritimus) displayed some shared characteristics such as low degree of humification, low aromatic content and high proportion of labile compounds, mainly polysaccharides and proteins. However, although the three salt marsh soils under study were covered by the same type of vegetation, the HS showed some important differences. HS composition was found to be determined not only by the nature of the original organic material, but also by environmental factors such as soil texture, redox conditions and tidal influence. In general. an increase in the humification process appeared to be related to aerobic conditions and predominance of sand in the mineral fraction of the soil, while the preservation of labile organic compounds may be associated with low redox potential values and fine soil texture.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon sorption dynamics in tidal marsh soils
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to adjacent waters and, consequently, exert a strong influence on the quantity and quality of DOC exported to the coastal oceans. Our understanding of the factors that control the exchange of DOC at the tidal marsh-estuarine interface, however, remains limited. We hypothesize that tidal marsh soils act as a regulator and that their physical characteristics, such as organic carbon content and mineral phase composition, are key controls on DOC exchange between soil surfaces and both surface and interstitial waters. To test this hypothesis, we generated traditional Langmuir sorption isotherms using anaerobic batch incubations of four tidal wetland soils, representing a range of soil organic carbon content (1.77% +/- 0.12% to 36.2% +/- 2.2%) and salinity regimes (freshwater to mixoeuhaline), across four salinity treatments. Results suggest that the maximum soil sorption capacity and DOC binding affinity increase and decrease with greater salinity, respectively, though the enhancement of maximum soil sorption capacity is somewhat mitigated in soils richer in poorly crystalline iron minerals. Initial natively sorbed organic carbon showed a significant positive correlation with soil specific surface area and K showed a moderate yet significant positive correlation with poorly crystalline iron mineral content. Taken together, these results point to a strong mineralogical control on tidal marsh sorption dynamics and a complex physicochemical response of those dynamics to salinity in tidal marsh soils.

TI  - Organic sulfur forms in mineral top soils of the Marsh in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the nature of, organic sulfur (S) in soils of the Marsh in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. In addition to total and inorganic S, we determined two organic S fractions, (ester sulfate-sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur) in 14 aerated. mineral top horizons of two salt marshes and ten dyked polder soils of different age. All soils, developed from marine sediments. Total S concentrations ranged from 153 to 950 mg kg(-1). Organic S was the main S constituent (range from 53 to 99% with a median of 97%). Higher inorganic S levels were found Only in the salt marshes due to soluble sulfate (15 to 47%). The younger marsh soils (salt marshes and soils of a polder dyked in 1978) had unique high S, contents of 0.9 to 2.4% in their, organic matter, whereas the S contents of the organic matter in older marsh soils were at only 0.6%, This S-rich organic matter is a heritage of a former anoxic marine environment. In most horizons the carbon-bonded S was the dominant sulfur form. However, both carbon-bonded S and ester sulfate-S did not relate to soil age. This limits the benefit of the wet chemical fractionation procedure used,for,studying the fate of organic S in marsh soils.

TI  - Microbial diversity and activity in the Nematostella vectensis holobiont: insights from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, isolate genomes, and a pilot-scale survey of gene expression
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have characterized the molecular and genomic diversity of the microbiota of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian model for comparative developmental and functional biology and a year-round inhabitant of temperate salt marshes. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed four ribotypes associated with N. vectensis at multiple locations and times. These associates include two novel ribotypes within the E-Proteobacterial order Campylobacterales and the Spirochetes, respectively, each sharing <85% identity with cultivated strains, and two gamma-Proteobacterial ribotypes sharing >99% 16S rRNA identity with Endozoicomonas elysicola and Pseudomonas oleovorans, respectively. Species-specific PCR revealed that these populations persisted in N. vectensis asexually propagated under laboratory conditions. cDNA indicated expression of the Campylobacterales and Endozoicomonas 16S rRNA in anemones from Sippewissett Marsh, MA. A collection of bacteria from laboratory raised N. vectensis was dominated by isolates from P. oleovorans and Rhizobium radiobacter. Isolates from field-collected anemones revealed an association with Limnobacter and Stappia isolates. Genomic DNA sequencing was carried out on 10 cultured bacterial isolates representing field- and laboratory-associates, i.e., Limnobacter spp., Stappia spp., P. oleovorans and R. radiobacter. Genomes contained multiple genes identified as virulence (host-association) factors while S. stellulata and L. thiooxidans genomes revealed pathways for mixotrophic sulfur oxidation. A pilot metatranscriptome of laboratory-raised N. vectensis was compared to the isolate genomes and indicated expression of ORFs from L. thiooxidans with predicted functions of motility, nutrient scavenging (Fe and P), polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis for carbon storage, and selective permeability (porins). We hypothesize that such activities may mediate acclimation and persistence of bacteria in a N. vectensis holobiont defined by both internal and external gradients of chemicals and nutrients in a dynamic coastal habitat.

TI  - Impact of cattle grazing on temperate coastal salt marsh soils
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, grazing intensity has increased in the temperate salt marshes of Samborombon Bay (Argentina) due to agricultural expansion and the displacement of domestic livestock to these areas. We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.

TI  - Tidal Marsh Restoration at Poplar Island: II. Elevation Trends, Vegetation Development, and Carbon Dynamics
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In natural tidal marshes, nutrient fertilization stimulates complex responses, bringing into question the suitability of nutrient-rich dredged material as a substrate for tidal marsh restoration. We examined vegetation and elevation trends in the constructed tidal marshes at Poplar Island, Maryland where fine-grained dredged material (high nutrient) and locally dredged sand (low nutrient) were used as substrates. Macrophyte production was higher and root:shoot ratios lower in dredged material marshes. Measured vertical accretion was similar in dredged material (7.4 +/- 0.6 mm y(-1)) and sand (6.4 +/- 0.9 mm y(-1)) marshes, and is keeping pace with local sea-level rise. A detailed carbon budget was developed for one dredged material marsh to examine carbon dynamics under high nutrient availability. High annual macrophyte production combined with small exports via tidal exchange and methane emissions resulted in an annual carbon burial of 206 g C m(-2) y(-1), and calculated vertical accretion of 6.5 mm y(-1) from organic matter. This is attributed to the contribution of organic matter from aboveground biomass due to protection from perimeter dikes constructed to contain dredged material during placement, reducing marsh exposure and organic matter export. With appropriate design and management, fine-grained, high-nutrient dredged material makes a suitable substrate for tidal marsh restoration.

TI  - Data from: Invasive Phragmites increases blue carbon stock and soil volume in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh
T2  - Mendeley Data
M3  - Data set
AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to the native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis increases soil volume and carbon stock. The former contributes to marsh resilience to sea level rise and the latter contributes to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Phragmites australis (common reed), is a cosmopolitan species that grows in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades, but has been little studied on the estuarine portion of the St. Lawrence River. We hypothesized that its replacement of native S. patens-dominated salt marsh would alter marsh soil organic carbon stocks (referred to as blue carbon) and accretion rates. To test this hypothesis, we collected soil cores from 3 sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and 1 site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at each site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm of vertical accretion in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services. This dataset includes relative soil carbon and belowground biomass composition data in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh invaded by Phragmites australis. Data were collected in 3 Phragmites sites in 2019 and 1 Spartina patens site in 2014. There are no data in belowgroud biomass composition in S. patens site. Data were collected to estimate the invasive Phragmites contribution to blue carbon stock and soil volume. This dataset contains one Excel file with two sheets ("main data" and "diameter"). These data are from field samples and lab analysis. Dry bulk density is calculated by dividing the dry weight by the initial volume. The organic matter content of the ground samples was measured through loss on ignition (LOI) with the equation developed by Craft et al. (1991): % organic carbon = 0.40*%LOI + 0.0025(%LOI)2. Rhizomes and roots are sorted (Niering et al. 1977) as much as possible to species and the volume of each species was determined by fluid displacement. The sorted rhizomes and roots were oven dried at 60 °C to constant weight.

TI  - Soils-Based Rapid Assessment for Quantifying Changes in Salt Marsh Condition as a Result of Hydrologic Alteration
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland condition can be severely altered as a result of a change in hydrology. In this study, we examined several soil-based methods to quantify and assess changes in salt marsh condition as a result of tidal restriction. Soil properties were compared between two tidally restricted and two (paired) unrestricted salt marshes. Organic horizon morphology provided a qualitative metric of marsh peat decomposition. Quantitative measures of the degree of decomposition included stable plant fragment content and bearing capacity. Soil pH provided simple metrics of changes in soil chemistry. Bulk density was measured to estimate marsh peat collapse and soil organic matter content provided a measure of carbon dynamics. Neither marsh showed significant differences in soil organic matter or bulk density relative to their paired reference marsh. In contrast, soil pH, stable plant fragment content, and bearing capacity were significantly different between restricted and reference marshes. With the exception of incubation pH, these soil properties can be simply and rapidly measured in the field to quantify physical, chemical, and biological changes in the wetland condition of salt marshes as a result of tidal restriction. Further studies should be conducted to develop a rapid protocol for measuring incubation pH in the field.

TI  - Density-dependent role of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on ecosystem service provision
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species can positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the provision of ecosystem services. The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders' density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 +/- 0.19m yr(-1) vs. -0.31 +/- 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 +/- 2.0 kg C m(-3) vs. 22.81 +/- 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 +/- 10.22 kg C m(-3)) than those with medium (13.99 +/- 1.23 kg C m(-3)) or high density (21.61 +/- 4.53 kg C m(-3)), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management.

TI  - Sulfate reduction in Louisiana marsh soils of varying salinities
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential sulfate reduction and in situ hydrogen sulfide emission rates for three Louisiana marsh soils of varying salinities (salt, brackish, and freshwater) were used to evaluate the influence of soil physicochemical parameters on sulfur transformations in different seasons (summer, winter, and spring). Solid adsorbent preconcentration and emission flux chambers were used in field experiments to measure hydrogen sulfide emissions. Soil redox potential (Eh) was measured at depths between 5 and 50 cm. Duplicate soil cores were obtained and sectioned for laboratory analysis. The fresh and brackish marsh soils were composed predominantly of organic matter, while the salt marsh soils were composed of predominantly minerals. Fresh marsh soils were generally the most oxidized and salt marsh soils the most reduced. In situ hydrogen sulfide emissions, but not potential sulfate reduction rates, were highest for the brackish marsh. Potential sulfate reduction assays may have overestimated in-situ rates, particularly for the more oxidized fresh marsh. Sulfate turnover times were longer in the salt marsh (approximately 40 days) than in either the fresh or the brackish marshes (3-8 days). Tidal action replenishes sulfate less frequently in the fresh and brackish marshes, thus sulfate depletions are more likely. The lowest potential sulfate reduction rates for all marshes occurred in winter. This was attributed to lower temperature and decreased soil sulfate content.

TI  - Model selection in Bayesian framework to identify the best WorldView-2 based vegetation index in predicting green biomass of salt marshes in the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems globally but have experienced dramatic degradation and loss within the past several decades. Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2 near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in remote sensing applications.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE) display a promising potential to act as natural carbon sinks in climate change mitigation. Although growing interest in wetland carbon has intensified the global level carbon stock estimation studies, large knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, particularly in tropical salt marshes in the South and Southeast Asian regions. Therefore, the current study aims to quantify the organic carbon stocks in the salt marsh habitats on the Northwest coast of Sri Lanka and to showcase the relevance of salt marsh carbon in local and regional contexts. Vegetation and soil up to a depth of 50 cm were sampled from four sites representing the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve (WNR). Species-specific allometric relationships developed for the major succulent halophytic species indicated a significant positive correlation between dry biomass and plant height. The loss-on-ignition (LOI) technique was applied in combination with a carbon conversion factor to calculate the soil organic carbon (SOC) content across 4 depth intervals. The study provided an average total organic carbon (TOC) storage of 73 ± 14.47 Mg C ha-1 up to a depth of 50 cm, in which the aboveground vegetation accounted for ~2% share. Sri Lankan salt marshes hold 2.01 Tg of organic carbon and directly reflect their potential for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This has been the first comprehensive study on salt marsh blue carbon stocks in Sri Lanka and the findings of this study will strengthen the knowledge base on regional and global saltmarsh carbon stocks and their potential role in climate change mitigation.

TI  - Plant biomass and soil organic carbon are main factors influencing dry-season ecosystem carbon rates in the coastal zone of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), ER (660.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), GEP (-2025.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) was a 10-year multi-investigator project funded by the Department of Defense to improve understanding of ecosystem processes and their interactions with natural and anthropogenic stressors at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) located in coastal North Carolina. The project was aimed at facilitating ecosystem-based management (EBM) at the MCBCL and other coastal military installations. Because of its scope, interdisciplinary character, and duration, DCERP embodied many of the opportunities and challenges associated with EBM, including the need for explicit goals, system models, longterm perspectives, systems complexity, change inevitability, consideration of humans as ecosystem components, and program adaptability and accountability. We describe key elements of this program, its contributions to coastal EBM, and its relevance as an exemplar of EBM.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha-1), to mangrove (46 t ha-1), to seagrass (27 t ha-1) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha-1). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta13C and delta15N mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Integrating outcomes of IUCN red list of ecosystems assessments for connected coastal wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced habitat clearing and pollution are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Ecosystem assessments are required to identify ecosystems at risk of collapse, but they should account for cross-system linkages and dynamics where necessary. This is particularly true for coastal wetlands (e.g. seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh), which exhibit high ecological connectivity and have individually suffered global declines over the last century. We use the coastal wetlands of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, as a model system to examine how integrating outcomes of multiple, simultaneously conducted, ecosystem assessments can assist in identifying appropriate management and conservation strategies. We simultaneously conducted separate assessments of seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems against the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria. Despite substantial human population growth in the region, seagrass and mangroves were assessed as Least Concern. Mangroves were found to be rapidly encroaching on saltmarsh. This process, together with past clearing, were the major drivers behind saltmarsh being assessed as Endangered. Given the importance of connectivity among these connected ecosystems, collapse in any one ecosystem can have seascape-wide consequences, highlighting the benefit of conducting multi-ecosystem assessments. Consequently, a fully integrated assessment of the coastal wetlands as a single entity would miss key processes, such as mangrove encroachment, potentially underestimating overall risks. Our study highlights the plight of saltmarsh and the value of conducting simultaneous RLE assessments for multiple ecosystems comprising seascapes. We recommend that connectivity be accounted for explicitly in assessments of other connected, high-risk ecosystems.

TI  - Benthic Biofilm Potential for Organic Carbon Accumulation in Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are productive environments with high potential for carbon accumulation and storage. Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.

TI  - Changes in Archaeal Community and Activity by the Invasion of Spartina anglica Along Soil Depth Profiles of a Coastal Wetland
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Invasion of Spartina spp. in tidal salt marshes may affect the function and characteristics of the ecosystem. Previous studies reported that the invasion alters biogeochemical and microbial processes in marsh ecosystems, yet our knowledge of changing archaeal community due to the invasion is still limited, whereas archaeal communities play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles within highly reduced marsh soils. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the influences of the Spartina anglica invasion on soil archaeal community and the depth profile of the influences. The relative abundance of archaeal phyla demonstrated that the invasion substantially shifted the characteristics of tidal salt marsh from marine to terrestrial soil only in surface layer, while the influences indirectly propagated to the deeper soil layer. In particular, two archaeal phyla, Asgardaeota and Diapherotrites, were strongly influenced by the invasion, indicating a shift from marine to terrestrial archaeal communities. The shifts in soil characteristics spread to the deeper soil layer that results in indirect propagation of the influences of the invasion down to the deeper soil, which was underestimated in previous studies. The changes in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and salinity were the substantial regulating factors for that. Therefore, changes in biogeochemical and microbial characteristics in the deep soil layer, which is below the root zone of the invasive plant, should be accounted for a more accurate illustration of the consequences of the invasion.

TI  - Denitrification rates in tidal marsh soils: The roles of soil texture, salinity and nitrogen enrichment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The denitrification rates of freshwater and oligohaline tidal marsh soils with different textures (loam and sandy soils) in a subtropical estuary, and their responses to nitrogen (N) loading, were investigated. In both marshes, the denitrification rates varied significantly with the season only in loam soil. The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.HighlightsDenitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.

TI  - Monitoring crude oil mineralization in salt marshes: Use of stable carbon isotope ratios
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In laboratory microcosms using salt marsh soils and in field trials, it was possible to monitor and quantify crude oil mineralization by measuring changes in CO2 delta(13)C signatures and the rate of CO2 production. These values are easy to obtain and can be combined with simple isotope mass balance equations to determine the rate of mineralization from both the crude oil and indigenous carbon pool. Hydrocarbon degradation was confirmed by simultaneous decreases in alkane-, isoprenoid-, and PAH-hopane ratios. Additionally, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of alkane degradation (0.087 day(-1)) and CO2 production (0.082 day(-1)) from oil predicted by the delta(13)C signatures were statistically indistinguishable. The addition of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate increased the rate of mineralization of crude oil in aerated microcosms but had no clear effect on in situ studies. This procedure appears to offer a means of definitively quantifying crude oil mineralization in a sensitive, inexpensive, and simple manner in environments with appropriate background delta(13)C signatures.

TI  - Spatial and Seasonal Variations of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Content and Stock in a Tidal Salt Marsh with Tamarix chinensis, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents and stocks in tidal salt marsh soils, 15 cores to a depth of 40 cm were collected in five sampling sites along a sampling belt during three seasons. Our results showed that higher SOC and TN contents occurred in the surface soils in three sampling seasons. Spatial distributions of SOC and TN showed moderate variability. The C/N ratios were higher in the summer and autumn than in spring. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and soil total nitrogen density (TND) ranked in the following order: autumn > spring > summer. And the SOCD values positively correlated with the distances from the tidal creek in summer, while this correlation was negative in autumn and spring. The soil properties, such as the soil moisture, salinity, C/N ratio and C/P ratio, significantly correlated with the SOC and TN contents and stocks. The water and salinity regulation and the alternation of ratios of ecological stoichiometry should be considered to strengthen carbon and nitrogen sequestration in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Methylmercury production in a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In a detailed study of the biogeochemical factors affecting the methylation of mercury in a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh, we examined relationships between mercury methylation and numerous variables, including sulfate reduction rates, organic carbon mineralization rates, iron and sulfur chemistry, and the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Our data show that salt marshes are important sites of de novo methylmercury (MeHg) production in coastal ecosystems. Some of the controls on MeHg production that have been well-described in other ecosystems also impacted MeHg production in this salt marsh, specifically the effect of sulfide accumulation on mercury bioavailability. We observed some novel biogeochemical relationships with Hg(II)-methylation and MeHg accumulation, particularly the positive association of Hg(II)-methylation with zones of microbial iron reduction. On the basis of this relationship, we suggest caution in wetland and groundwater remediation approaches involving iron additions. Aqueous phase Hg complexation appeared to be the dominant control on Hg bioavailability across the marsh sites examined, rather than Hg partitioning behavior. A detailed examination of DOM character in the marsh suggested a strong positive association between Hg(II)-methylation rate constants and increasing DOM molecular weight. Overall, our results indicate that net MeHg production is controlled by a balance between microbial activity and geochemical effects on mercury bioavailability, but that a significant zone of MeHg production can persist in near surface salt marsh soils. Production of MeHg in coastal marshes may negatively impact ecosystems via export to adjacent estuaries or through direct bioaccumulation in birds, fish and amphibians that feed in these highly productive ecosystems.

TI  - Response of anaerobic carbon mineralization rates to sulfate amendments in a boreal peatland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A small body of research suggests that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can affect the carbon balance of peatlands, yet this has not been tested widely, despite the fact that peatlands contain approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Here we evaluate the role of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in a site that receives low atmospheric sulfur deposition. We hypothesized that, in peatlands receiving low sulfate inputs, methane production should dominate anaerobic carbon mineralization. We further hypothesized that with sulfate amendments, anaerobic carbon mineralization could show an overall increase if terminal carbon mineralization in unamended peat is limited by an inadequate supply of electron acceptors. To test these hypotheses, we delineated six 1-m(2) plots in an ombrotrophic, boreal peatland in central Alberta, Canada (Bleak Lake Bog), which receives <2 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1). Three of the plots were amended with sulfate (78 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1)). We measured anaerobic rates of sulfate reduction, CH4 production, and CO2 production. In opposition to our hypotheses, sulfate amendments did not increase rates of sulfate reduction, increase CO2 production, or decrease CH4 production over a 2-yr period, but did increase both sulfate pool sizes and residence times. Despite low rates of sulfate reduction compared to other freshwater wetlands, daily average sulfate reduction (1.7 mmol/m(2)) exceeded regional annual inputs of atmospheric sulfate deposition (1.6 mmol/m(2)). Between 77% and 99% of reduced sulfate was incorporated into the carbon-bonded sulfur pool, which turns over slowly. The slow turnover rate and comparatively low sulfate reduction rates may be related to the low iron content of the bog peat. Additionally, sulfate reduction initially was sulfate limited in the control plots, but with sulfur amendments, the sulfate limitation was removed; sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by some other factor, possibly labile carbon. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was more important to total anaerobic carbon mineralization than methane production, although neither process dominated overall anaerobic carbon mineralization (<2% of total). Fermentation appeared to be the dominant anaerobic carbon mineralization pathway at Bleak Lake Bog, yet the mechanisms of how this process affects the carbon balance of peatlands has never been evaluated. Overall, our results suggest that, in at least the short term, soil carbon turnover in peatlands will not be enhanced by increased atmospheric sulfur deposition. If we want to understand the controlling factors on soil carbon storage in sites like Bleak Lake Bog, we should begin to examine anaerobic carbon mineralization via fermentation pathways.

TI  - Phosphorus fractionation and distribution in salt marsh soils affected by mine wastes and eutrophicated water: A case study in SE Spain
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to establish the distribution and fate of phosphorus in the soils of a coastal salt marsh affected by mine wastes and wastewater effluents. Water samples from two watercourses were analysed for soluble phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon and soil samples within the marsh were analysed for total P, Fe, N and CaCO3. In addition, a fractionation of the phosphorus was performed. The results indicate that high concentrations of soluble phosphorus (up to 12.3 mg PO43-P L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (up to 36.5 mg L-1) flowed from one of the 4 watercourses into the salt marsh. Organic residual P was the most abundant P form in the soils, constituting between 38.6 and 76.6% of the total P, whereas P associated with humic acids was less abundant (less than 3%). Among the mineral soil components, Ca and Mg compounds were the most active in phosphorus retention (up to 50% of the total P), except in the plots most affected by mine wastes. In the latter sites, the highest Fe (up to 247 g kg(-1)) and the lowest CaCO3 (8.9 g kg(-1)) concentrations were obtained, and Fe- and Al-bound P was the most abundant fraction, reaching 23.9% of the total P. Unusually low total nitrogen/total phosphorus ratios (between 5.4 and 5.7) showed that marsh areas affected by wastewater effluents are acting as phosphorus sinks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparing soil carbon sequestration in coastal freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features and plant communities in Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important carbon sinks across the planet. However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.

AB  - Plant-mediated processes are often important in determining carbon cycling and storage in ecosystems. With climate-induced changes in the environment, plant-associated processes may also shift. Salt marshes in particular are useful systems to investigate plant-mediated carbon cycling, as these systems experience both sea-level rise and increased carbon dioxide concentrations due to climate change, in addition to stochastically experiencing extreme drought and flood conditions. We measured biomass, soil, and gas carbon pools and the fluxes between those pools using a mesocosm approach in a salt marsh system, to investigate the response of plant-mediated carbon cycling to near-term climate change.

TI  - Hydrodynamics affect plant traits in estuarine ecotones with impact on carbon sequestration potentials
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that play an important role in carbon fixing. The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream. Due to sea level rise, the area of estuarine vegetation may decrease because a fixed dike line along the river prevents landward migration, which can reduce the amount of biomass produced and with it the potential to store SOC. Restoration of the tidal marshes or realignment of the dikes may be necessary to protect the ecosystem properties and services of estuarine vegetation.

TI  - Blue Carbon Stocks and Cross-Habitat Subsidies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

TI  - Variation of soil carbon and nitrogen storage in a natural restoration chronosequence of reclaimed temperate marshes
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland restoration significantly affects ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycles by changing soil physicochemical properties and plant properties. To reveal the effect of wetland restora-tion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage, we measured the SOC and TN content and calculated their storage in a restoration chronosequence (1, 4, 8, 13, 17, 27 years) and compared them with those in a soybean field and a natural marsh, all in Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. Our results showed that the SOC and TN content and storage in the in-vestigated sites increased with restoration time. However, the restoration rate was faster in the first 8 years but slowed down after 8 years of restoration. The SOC and TN content and storage decreased with soil depths in the eight sites. After 27 years of restoration, the carbon and nitrogen storage in the restored site was 2.8 and 1.9 times that in the soybean field, respec-tively. However, the SOC and TN storage in the 27-year restored site was 45.3% and 35.1% lower than that in the natural marsh, respectively. The SOC and TN content, bulk density, moisture content, clay, and plant belowground biomass significantly impact the SOC and TN storage (P < 0.01). This study indicates that marsh restoration contributes to the accumulation of SOC and TN, but the restoration of SOC and TN storage to the level of natural marshes may take decades.

TI  - Invasive cordgrass (Spartina spp.) in south-eastern Australia induces island formation, salt marsh development, and carbon storage
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive vegetation species can lead to major changes in the geomorphology of coastal systems. Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.

TI  - Vehicle track damage to salt marsh soil and vegetation at Culbin Sands, NE Scotland
T2  - Botanical Journal of Scotland
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of 3 year old vehicle tracks on salt marsh soil and vegetation within Culbin Sands SSSI on the Moray Firth, Scotland were investigated. Vehicle tracks destroyed the organic layer which was present in the later successional communities. Soil penetration resistance and bulk density were increased, and moisture content and salinity were decreased inside all the tracks, thus soil characteristics were shifted towards those typical of lower marsh zones. Penetration resistance within tracks reached levels which may inhibit root elongation. Vegetation inside tracks remained in earlier successional stages than the surrounding communities, particularly on the lower marsh where recovery may be slowed by repeated disturbance by tidal water. Vegetation on the mid and upper marsh showed less successional shift, but was still changed, being more diverse within the tracks. There was also a significant amount of bare ground within these tracks, which could facilitate erosion. Effects of vehicle tracks thus vary between salt marsh zones, but are damaging wherever they occur; there appears to be no 'less damaging' route on which vehicles could be directed.

TI  - Estuarine submerged aquatic vegetation habitat provides organic carbon storage across a shifting landscape
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Total ecosystem carbon stocks at the marine-terrestrial interface: Blue carbon of the Pacific Northwest Coast, United States
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

The intertidal "mud" soils are colonized by Collembola to depth of 30 cm and at a distance of 10 m towards the sea from coastal edge. The communities of Collembola in low intertidal saltmarsh soils are dominated by a population of Archisotoma sp. The contents of organic matter in the intertidal saltmarsh soils influenced the distribution of Archisotoma sp.

TI  - The impact of sea-level rise on organic matter decay rates in Chesapeake Bay brackish tidal marshes
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The balance between organic matter production and decay determines how fast coastal wetlands accumulate soil organic matter. Despite the importance of soil organic matter accumulation rates in influencing marsh elevation and resistance to sea-level rise, relatively little is known about how decomposition rates will respond to sea-level rise. Here, we estimate the sensitivity of decomposition to flooding by measuring rates of decay in 87 bags filled with milled sedge peat, including soil organic matter, roots and rhizomes. Experiments were located in field-based mesocosms along 3 mesohaline tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Mesocosm elevations were manipulated to influence the duration of tidal inundation. Although we found no significant influence of inundation on decay rate when bags from all study sites were analyzed together, decay rates at two of the sites increased with greater flooding. These findings suggest that flooding may enhance organic matter decay rates even in water-logged soils, but that the overall influence of flooding is minor. Our experiments suggest that sea-level rise will not accelerate rates of peat accumulation by slowing the rate of soil organic matter decay. Consequently, marshes will require enhanced organic matter productivity or mineral sediment deposition to survive accelerating sea-level rise.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems, such as saltmarsh, produce a range of ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. In the UK, and globally, saltmarsh extent and quality is declining due to coastal squeeze, deteriorating water quality, and agricultural activities. Here, we develop a general framework to evaluate changes in coastal defence. Using this framework, we identify priority areas for saltmarsh re-alignment: re-creation of saltmarsh in areas that have been saltmarsh in the past - but that have been claimed for a variety of land uses, particularly agriculture. We base our re-alignment prioritisation on the ecosystem services provided by saltmarsh in the North Devon Biosphere Reserve: specifically carbon sequestration and recreational benefits, and the economic values of those services. We compare potential economic benefits with the economic costs of creating new saltmarsh areas - specifically lost agricultural output, property damages and direct re-alignment costs. We identify a number of priority areas for managed re-alignment that generate high recreational values in areas where properties would not be damaged. These findings provide a necessary and timely analysis for the managers of the North Devon Biosphere Reserve. Furthermore, we outline a comprehensive methodology to plan future management of coastal zones.

TI  - Distribution and biogeochemical controls on net methylmercury production in Penobscot River marshes and sediment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of mercury and methylmercury (MeHg) in sediment, mudflats, and marsh soils of the Hg-contaminated tidal Penobscot River was investigated, along with biogeochemical controls on production. Average total Hg in surface samples (0-3 cm) ranged from 100 to 1200 ng/g; average MeHg ranged from 5 to 50 ng/g. MeHg was usually highest at or near the surface except in highly mobile mudflats. Although total Hg concentrations in the Penobscot are elevated, it is the accumulation of MeHg that stands out in comparison to other ecosystems. Surface soils in the large Mendall Marsh, about 17 km downstream from the contamination source, contained particularly high %MeHg (averaging 8%). In Mendall marsh soil porewaters, MeHg often accounted for more than half of total Hg.Salt marshes are areas of particular concern in the Penobscot River, for they are depositional environments for a Hg-contaminated mobile pool of river sediment, hot spots for net MeHg production, and sources of risk to marsh animals. We hypothesized that exceptionally low mercury partitioning between the solid and aqueous phases (with log Kd averaging similar to 4.5) drives high MeHg in Penobscot marshes. The co-occurrence of iron and sulfide in filtered soil porewaters, sometimes both above 100 mu M, suggests the presence of nanoparticulate and/or colloidal metal sulfides. These colloids may be stabilized by high concentrations of aromatic and potentially sulfurized dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marsh soils. Thus, Hg in Penobscot marsh soils appears to be in a highly available for microbial methylation through the formation of DOM-associated HgS complexes. Additionally, low partitioning of MeHg to marsh soils suggests high MeHg bioavailability to animals. Overall, drivers of high MeHg in Penobscot marshes include elevated Hg in soils, low partitioning of Hg to solids, high Hg bioavailability for methylation, rapidly shifting redox conditions in surface marsh soils, and high rates of microbial activity.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration aims to restore biodiversity and valuable functions that have been degraded or lost. The Coral Triangle is a hotspot for marine biodiversity held in its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, all of which are in global decline. These coastal ecosystems support valuable fisheries and endangered species, protect shorelines, and are significant carbon stores, functions that have been degraded by coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems affect human well-being in many important ways, and restoration will become ever more important as conservation efforts cannot keep up with their loss.

TI  - Rhizosphere and flooding regime as key factors for the mobilisation of arsenic and potentially harmful metals in basic, mining-polluted salt marsh soils
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of mining areas in the vicinities of salt marshes may affect their ecological functions and facilitate the transfer of pollutants into the food chain. The mobilisation of metals in salt marsh soils is controlled by abiotic (pH, redox potential) and biotic (influence of rhizosphere) factors. The effect of the rhizosphere of two plant species (Sarcocornia fruticosa and Phragmites australis) and different flooding regimes on potentially harmful metals and As mobilisation from salt marsh soil polluted by mining activities were investigated (total concentrations: 536 mg kg(-1) As, 37 mg kg(-1) Cd, 6746 mg kg(-1) Pb, 15,320 mg kg(-1) Zn). The results show that the changes in redox conditions (from 300 mV to -100 mV) and pH after flooding and rewetting periods may mobilise the contaminant elements into soil solution (e.g., 100 mu g L-1 Cd, 30 mu g L-1 Pb, 7 mg L-1 Zn), where they are available for plants or may be leached from the soil. Drying periods generated peaks of concentrations in the soil solution (up to 120 mu g L-1 Cd and 50 mu g L-1 Pb). The risk assessment of As and metal-polluted salt marshes should take into account flood dynamics in order to prevent metal(loid) mobilisation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - What do we need to assess the sustainability of the tidal salt marsh carbon sink?
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide a range of ecosystem services. The most recently recognized is their provision of highly effective sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, a characteristic they share with mangroves swamps which largely replace salt marshes in the intertidal zones of tropical regions. Efforts are emerging to use salt marsh preservation or restoration in carbon offset programs, similar to the REDD initiative for tropical forests, but a number of issues first must be addressed to determine if a site meets the requirements of these programs. As intertidal systems, both salt marshes and mangrove swamps are threatened by increasing rates of sea level rise, and it will be essential to determine their sustainability, thus meeting the requirement of permanence of the carbon sink. In many areas the vegetation responsible for marsh soil accretion may not survive increased flooding periods, resulting in submergence of the marsh in its present location or inability to restore a marsh at its previous elevation. However, the marsh and its carbon sink, may survive if allowed to migrate inland. Thus assessment of permanence requires a determination if inland migration will be hindered by barriers such as high slopes or development, i.e., if the ecosystem is in a coastal squeeze. Presently, the only technology that can provide elevation models at the required vertical accuracy is Lidar, which also is extremely valuable for assessing vulnerability of coastal communities to flooding. Yet, Lidar data is not available for all coastlines, even those in the developed world. To effectively plan for the future of our coastlines requires Lidar coverage on all sensitive coastlines and its free availability for impact assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effects of N, P and crude oil on the decomposition of Spartina alterniflora belowground biomass
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine how the decomposition of particulate belowground organic matter from a salt marsh is enhanced, or not, by different mixtures of crude oil, nitrogen (N), or phosphorus (P) acting individually or synergistically. The experiment was conducted in 3.8 L sampling chambers producing varying quantities of gas whose volume was used as a surrogate measure of organic decomposition under anaerobic conditions. Gas production after 28 days, from highest to lowest, was +NP = +N >>> +P, or +oil. The gas production under either +P or +oil conditions was indistinguishable from gas production in the control chamber. Nitrogen, not phosphorus, or +NP, was the dominant factor controlling organic decomposition rates in these experiments. The implication for organic salt marsh soils is that shoreline erosion is enhanced by salt marsh oiling, presumably by its toxicity, but not by its effect on the decomposition rates of plant biomass belowground. Nutrient additions, on the other hand, may compromise the soil strength, creating a stronger disparity in soil strength between upper and lower soil layers leading to marsh loss. Nutrient amendments intended to decrease oil concentration in the marsh may not have the desired effect, and are likely to decrease soil strength, thereby enhancing marsh-to-water conversions in organic salt marsh soils.

TI  - THE RESPONSE OF COASTAL MARSHES TO SEA-LEVEL RISE - SURVIVAL OR SUBMERGENCE
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to maintain an elevation in the intertidal zone at which marsh vegetation can survive, vertical accretion of the marsh surface must take place at a rate at least equal to the rate of relative sea-level rise. Net vertical accretion of coastal marshes is a result of interactions between tidal imports, vegetation and depositional processes. All of these factors are affected, directly or indirectly, by alterations in marsh hydrology which might occur as a result of sea-level rise. The overall response of coastal marshes to relative sea-level rise depends upon the relative importance of the inorganic and organic components of the marsh soil and the impact of increased hydroperiod on net accumulation. The varied combination of factors contributing to sediment supply, and their complexity at the scale of individual marshes, means that predicting the response of suspended sediment concentration in marsh floodwater to any changes which may occur as a result of sealevel rise, at anything other than the local scale is unlikely to be accurate. The impact of sea-level rise on net below-ground production is also complex. The sensitivity of certain species to waterlogging and soil chemical changes could result in a change in species composition or the migration of vegetation zones. Consequently, predicting the net impact of sea-level rise on organic matter accumulation is fraught with difficulties and requires improved understanding of interactions between vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes.

TI  - A global map of saltmarshes
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - BackgroundSaltmarshes are extremely valuable but often overlooked ecosystems, contributing to livelihoods locally and globally through the associated ecosystem services they provide, including fish production, carbon storage and coastal protection. Despite their importance, knowledge of the current spatial distribution (occurrence and extent) of saltmarshes is incomplete. In light of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures on coastal ecosystems, global data on the occurrence and extent of saltmarshes are needed to draw attention to these critical ecosystems and to the benefits they generate for people. Such data can support resource management, strengthen decision-making and facilitate tracking of progress towards global conservation targets set by multilateral environmental agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the United Nations' (UN's) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Ramsar Convention.New informationHere, we present the most complete dataset on saltmarsh occurrence and extent at the global scale. This dataset collates 350,985 individual occurrences of saltmarshes and presents the first global estimate of their known extent.The dataset captures locational and contextual data for saltmarsh in 99 countries worldwide. A total of 5,495,089 hectares of mapped saltmarsh across 43 countries and territories are represented in a Geographic Information Systems polygon shapefile. This estimate is at the relatively low end of previous estimates (2.2-40 Mha), however, we took the conservative approach in the mapping exercise and there are notable areas in Canada, Northern Russia, South America and Africa where saltmarshes are known to occur that require additional spatial data. Nevertheless, the most extensive saltmarsh worldwide are found outside the tropics, notably including the low-lying, ice-free coasts, bays and estuaries of the North Atlantic which are well represented in our global polygon dataset. Therefore, despite the gaps, we believe that, while incomplete, our global polygon data cover many of the important areas in Europe, the USA and Australia.

TI  - NITROGEN ASSESSMENTS IN A CONSTRUCTED AND A NATURAL SALT-MARSH OF SAN-DIEGO BAY
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nitrogen pools were lower in a 4-yr-old constructed salt marsh than in an adjacent natural marsh of San Diego Bay.  Aboveground biomass and foliar nitrogen content of Spartina foliosa were both lower for the constructed marsh.  Soil organic carbon, which was highly positively correlated with total nitrogen, was also lower in theconstructed marsh. Rates of nitrogen fixation were higher for the natural marsh in surface soils (1 cm depth) but not in the rhizosphere (10 cm depth).  Experimental additions of organic matter increased rates of nitrogen fixation substantially for both the constructed and natural marsh soils, with glucose stimulating greater increases than Spartina foliosa detritus (roots and rhizomes).  In comparison with natural marshes studied elsewhere, the San Diego Bay sites have low nitrogen pools and little soil organic carbon.  Nitrogen mineralization rates (in situ incubations) were high in both marshes studied.  The low nitrogen pools reflect low tidal import and infrequent streamflow influxes and, possibly, high nitrogen demands of vegetation stressed by hypersaline soils.

TI  - A review of sediment carbon sampling methods in mangroves and their broader impacts on stock estimates for blue carbon ecosystems.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrasses, are attracting interest for their potential to mitigate climate change arising from their high rates of carbon accumulation and the significant carbon stocks in their sediments. However, current sediment carbon sampling methods present a mixture of approaches adopted from paleoenvironmental methods focused on historical reconstruction of carbon accumulation, and from soil science methods developed to provide highly accurate and spatially representative carbon stock measurements. Currently, no international standard method for sediment carbon stock analysis exists. Consequently, current estimates of sediment carbon stock values for BCEs may have large uncertainties due to variable methodology. We reviewed and analysed the methods used 217 studies included in two recent global syntheses of carbon stocks in mangrove forest ecosystems to illustrate a lack of consistency in sediment sampling. We then outline how the choice of study design and field sampling methods can introduce inaccuracies and uncertainties in sediment carbon stock analysis. We conclude with examples of how each of these challenges can be resolved and how greater carbon stock quantification accuracy and higher spatial integration can be achieved for blue carbon ecosystems in the future.

TI  - Significant Organic Carbon Accumulation in Two Coastal Acid Sulfate Soil Wetlands
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy.Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - SOIL RESPIRATION RATES IN COASTAL MARSHES SUBJECT TO INCREASING WATERSHED NITROGEN LOADS IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mean soil respiration rates (carbon dioxide efflux from bare soils) among salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, RI ranged from 1.7-7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in Spartina patens in high marsh zones and 1.7-6.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in S. alterniflora in low marsh zones. The soil respiration rates significantly increased along a gradient of increasing watershed nitrogen (N) loads (S. alterniflora, R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.0008; S. patens, R-2 = 0.70, P = 0.02). As the soil respiration increased, the percent carbon (C) and N in the soil surface layer decreased in the S. alterniflora, suggesting that in part, the increased soil respiration rates are contributing to the increased turnover of labile organic matter. In contrast, there were no apparent relationships between the soil respiration rates in the high marsh and the soil C and N contents of the surface layer. However, there was a broad-scale pattern and significant inverse relationship between the high marsh soil respiration rates and the landscape belowground biomass of S. patens. As more and more salt marsh systems are subjected to increasing nutrient loads, decomposition rates of soil organic matter may increase in marsh soils leading to higher turnover rates of C and N.

TI  - Modelling Aboveground Biomass Carbon Stock of the Bohai Rim Coastal Wetlands by Integrating Remote Sensing, Terrain, and Climate Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) carbon stock of coastal wetlands by establishing Vis-related linear models. However, these models always have high uncertainties due to the large spatial variation and fragmentation of coastal wetlands. In this paper, an efficient coastal wetland AGB model for the Bohami Rim coastal wetlands was presented based on multiple data sets. The model was developed statistically with 7 independent variables from 23 metrics derived from remote sensing, topography, and climate data. Compared to previous models, it had better performance, with a root mean square error and r value of 188.32 g m(-2) and 0.74, respectively. Using the model, we firstly generated a regional coastal wetland AGB map with a 10 m spatial resolution. Based on the AGB map, the AGB carbon stock of the Bohai Rim coastal wetland was 2.11 Tg C in 2019. The study demonstrated that integrating emerging high spatial resolution multi-remote sensing data and several auxiliary metrics can effectively improve VIs-based coastal wetland AGB models. Such models with emerging freely available data sets will allow for the rapid monitoring and better understanding of the special role that "blue carbon " plays in global carbon cycle.

TI  - Bacterial Succession in Salt Marsh Soils Along a Short-term Invasion Chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora in the Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an exotic plant species, Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem function in Chinese coastal regions. Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities. Overall, our findings highlight the bacterial community succession during the Spartina alterniflora invasion in coastal salt marsh soils, which can provide insight regarding the association between soil development and invasive plant.

TI  - Effects of Extreme Events on Arsenic Cycling in Salt Marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme events such as storm surges, intense precipitation, and supermoons cause anomalous and large fluctuations in water level in tidal salt marshes, which impacts the sediment biogeochemistry that dictates arsenic (As) cycling. In addition to changes in water level, which impacts soil redox potential, these extreme events may also change salinity due to freshwater inputs from precipitation or saltwater inputs due to surge. It is currently unknown how As mobility in tidal salt marshes will be impacted by extreme events, as fluctuations in salinity and redox potential may act synergistically to mobilize As. To investigate impacts of extreme events on As cycling in tidal salt marshes, we conducted a combined laboratory and field investigation. We monitored pore water and soil samples before, during, and after two extreme events: a supermoon lunar eclipse followed by a storm surge and precipitation induced by Hurricane Joaquin in fall 2015 at the St. Jones Reserve in Dover, Delaware, a representative tidal salt marsh in the Mid-Atlantic United States. We also conducted soil incubations of marsh sediments in batch and in flow-through experiments in which redox potential and/or salinity were manipulated. Field investigations showed that pore water As was inversely proportional to redox potential. During the extreme events, a distinct pulse of As was observed in the pore water with maximum salinity. Combined field and laboratory investigations revealed that this As pulse is likely due to rapid changes in salinity. These results have implications for As mobility in the face of extreme weather variability.

TI  - Factors influencing the organic carbon pools in tidal marsh soils of the Elbe estuary (Germany)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Soils of tidal marshes play an important role in regional carbon (C) cycles as they are able to store considerable amounts of organic carbon (OC). However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.

TI  - Dynamic characteristics of soil respiration in Yellow River Delta wetlands, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The stable soil carbon (C) pool in coastal wetlands, referred to as "blue C", which has been extensively damaged by climate change and soil degradation, is of importance to maintain global C cycle. Therefore, to investigate the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration rate and evaluate C budgets in coastal wetlands are urgently. In this study, the diurnal and seasonal variation of soil respiration rate in the reed wetland land (RL) and the bare wetland land (BL) was measured in situ with the dynamic gas-infrared CO2 method in four seasons, and the factors impacted on the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration were investigated. The results showed that the diurnal variation of soil respiration rate consistently presented a "U" curve pattern in April, July, and September, with the maximum values at 12: 00 a.m. and the minimum values at 6: 00 a.m. In the same season, the diurnal soil respiration rate in RL was significantly greater than those in BL (P < 0.05). In April, July, and September, the mean diurnal soil respiration rate was 0.14, 0.42, and 0.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in RL, 0.05, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.01 mmol m(-2) s(-1) in BL, respectively. Soil surface temperature was the primary factor that influenced soil respiration, which was confirmed by the exponential positive correlation between the soil respiration rate and soil surface temperature in BL and RL (P < 0.05). In addition, the high salinity of soils suppressed soil respiration, confirming by the significantly negative correlation between soil respiration rate and the content of soluble salt. These results will be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying soil respiration and elevating C sequestration potential in the coastal wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Change in saltmarsh extent for six regions across Great Britain (1846-2016)
T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - Data are presented showing change in saltmarsh extent along 25 estuaries/embayments in six regions across Great Britain, between 1846 and 2016. Data were captured from maps and aerial photographs. Marsh extent was delineated a scale of 1:7,500 by placing vertices every 5 m along the marsh edge. Error introduced from: (i) inaccuracies in the basemap used to georeference maps and aerial photographs; (ii) the georeferencing procedure itself; (iii) the interpreter when placing vertices on the marsh edge; and (iv) map and photo distortions that occurred prior to digitisation were calculated and used to estimate the root mean square error (RMSE) in areal extent of each marsh complex. Measures of marsh extent were only recorded if maps and aerial photographs were available for the entire estuary/embayment. Data was collected as part of a study on the large-scale, long-term trends and causes of lateral saltmarsh change. The data was used in the analysis for Ladd et al. (2019). C. Ladd and M.F. Duggan-Edwards carried out the collection and processing of the saltmarsh extent data. All authors contributed to the interpretation of the data. The work was carried out under the NERC programme - Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environment (C-SIDE), NERC grant reference NE/R010846/1. The aerial extent change in saltmarsh extent across Great Britain came into existence by using Ordnance Survey (OS) maps and aerial photographs to delineate marsh extent for each estuary.. Marsh extent was delineated in ArcGIS 10.6 at a scale of 1:7,500 by placing vertices every 5m along the marsh edge. A Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) term (in meters) was calculated for each marsh complex by assessing error introduced by: (i) inaccuracies in the basemap used to georeference maps and aerial photographs; (ii) the georeferencing procedure itself; (iii) the interpreter when placing vertices on the marsh edge; and (iv) map and photo distortions that occurred prior to digitisation. To qualitatively assess whether the vectorised layer could be considered accurate, the most recent digitised marsh extent was compared against national marsh extent layers to ensure general agreement. Literature searches were also done to verify whether observations of significant change in marsh extent were reliable, or whether errors introduced by map surveyors on the location of the marsh edge likely explain the differences.

TI  - Alkalinity Production Coupled to Pyrite Formation Represents an Unaccounted Blue Carbon Sink
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, mitigate climate change by storing atmospheric carbon. Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103 +/- 61 Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30 +/- 30 Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32 +/- 1 Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197 Mg/ha (RMSE = 24 Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (similar to 3 mol/m(2)/y) is equal to similar to 24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.

Estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marsh areas were based on a 2010 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) map. Aboveground biomass maps were generated from a random forest model driven by Landsat vegetation indices and a national scale dataset of field-measured aboveground biomass. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices, with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important, successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle, and growth form.

TI  - Variability of properties used as differentiating criteria in tidal marsh soils
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional statistics were used to study the variability of the soils in Hell Hook marsh along the Chesapeake Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland. Analysis of variance and least significant difference test suggested that the differentiating characteristics and the accessory physical and chemical properties were significantly different among three pedons located 20 m apart. The spatial distribution of the mean coefficient of variation demonstrated that the spatial variability of organic carbon and total sulfur within a pedon is random rather than systematic. The magnitude of variability among and within pedons substantiates the importance of establishing a feasible sampling protocol. However, because of the great variability of tidal marsh soils, there is often the need to balance the desire for high confidence level and accuracy with the need for a reasonable sampling protocol. This was accomplished by accepting an 80% confidence level and 20% accuracy rather than more rigorous estimates and was achieved by making a single observation to estimate the thickness of the organic horizon and by collecting three samples, on average, within 1 to 2 m to estimate total sulfur and organic carbon.

TI  - Will a rising sea sink some estuarine wetland ecosystems?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise associated with climate change presents a major challenge to plant diversity and ecosystem service provision in coastal wetlands. In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter.Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant.While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation of increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by plants may be more efficient in saline systems with soils lower in organic matter than in other freshwater systems. In saline systems, decomposition rates may be lower and potential soil carbon storage higher than in fresh water systems. The effects of salinity, plant species and time on CO2 surface flux and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) leached during irrigation were determined in the laboratory in microcosms containing sand amended with residues of two halophytes, Atriplex nummularia and Salicornia bigelovii, and one glycophyte, Triticum aestivum. Surface flux of CO2 and DOC leached during decomposition were monitored for 133 days at 24 degrees C in microcosms containing different plant residue (5% w/w). Microcosms were irrigated every 14 days with distilled water or seawater adjusted to 10, 20, or 40 g L(-1) salts. CO2 flux and DOC leached were significantly higher from microcosms amended with A. nummularia residue compared to S. bigelovii or T. aestivum at all salinities and decreased significantly over time for all plant species. Irrigating with water of high salinity, 40 g L(-1), compared to distilled water resulted in a decrease in CO2 surface Aux and DOC in leachate, but differences were not significant at all sampling dates. Results indicate that plant residue composition, as well as increased salinity, affect CO2 surface flux and DOC in leachate during plant residue decomposition and may be an important consideration for C storage in saline systems.

TI  - Importance of the hydrogen route in up-scaling electrosynthesis for microbial CO2 reduction
T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out under two different applied potentials, -0.36 V and -0.66 V vs. SHE, using a biological sludge as the inoculum. Both potentials were thermodynamically appropriate for converting CO2 to acetate but only -0.66 V enabled hydrogen evolution. No acetate production was observed at -0.36 V, while up to 244 +/- 20 mg L-1 acetate was produced at -0.66 V vs. SHE. The same microbial inoculum implemented in gas-liquid contactors with H-2 and CO2 gas supply led to acetate production of 2500 mg L-1. When a salt marsh sediment was used as the inoculum, no reduction was observed in the electrochemical reactors, while supplying H-2 + CO2 gas led to formate and then acetate production. Finally, pure cultures of Sporomusa ovata grown under H-2 and CO2 gas feeding showed acetate production of up to 2904 mg L-1, higher than those reported so far in the literature for S. ovata implemented in bioelectrochemical processes. Unexpected ethanol production of up to 1411 mg L-1 was also observed. All these experimental data confirm that hydrogen produced on the cathode by water electrolysis is an essential mediator in the microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2. Implementing homoacetogenic microbial species in purposely designed gas-liquid biocontactors should now be considered as a relevant strategy for developing CO2 conversion.

TI  - Methanogenesis in saltmarsh soils of the North Sea coast of Germany
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate saltmarshes are a potential source of atmospheric methane. We have measured the concentration and emission of methane in typical saltmarsh soils (Salic Fluvisols) and humus-rich saltmarsh soils (Thionic Fluvisols) from the German North Sea coast. We also measured the methane production rates of the latter. The methane content of typical saltmarsh soils reached 12.0 mu mol l(-1), although values of 1-4 mu mol l(-1) were usual. The sulphate concentrations of the pore-water were about 10 mM, which means sulphate reduction is not limited and methanogenesis would be suppressed. Methane concentrations were generally largest in summer. Independent of the redox potential and the degree of soil development, methane concentrations were smallest in those soils poorest in humus. Methane emission rates were almost zero. In the humus-rich saltmarsh soils, methane concentrations were roughly a thousand times larger than those in typical saltmarsh soils, reaching values of 23 mmol l(-1). The sulphate concentrations of the pore-water were often less than 1 mM, indicating limited sulphate reduction. Methane production was up to 80 mu g cm(-3) day(-1) and was not inhibited when we added sulphate. Methane emission rates reached up to 190 mu g m(-2) day(-1) in summer, with values up to 20 mu g m(-2) day(-1) at other times. The two kinds of saltmarsh soil behave quite differently: the typical saltmarsh soils act as a sink for methane; the humus-rich saltmarsh soils are a source.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasion controls organic carbon stocks in coastal marsh and mangrove soils across tropics and subtropics
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems and store large amounts of organic carbon (C)-the so termed "blue carbon." However, wetlands in the tropics and subtropics have been invaded by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) affecting storage of blue C. To understand how S. alterniflora affects soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sources, stability, and their spatial distribution, we sampled soils along a 2500 km coastal transect encompassing tropical to subtropical climate zones. This included 216 samplings within three coastal wetland types: a marsh (Phragmites australis) and two mangroves (Kandelia candel and Avicennia marina). Using delta C-13, C:nitrogen (N) ratios, and lignin biomarker composition, we traced changes in the sources, stability, and storage of SOC in response to S. alterniflora invasion. The contribution of S. alterniflora-derived C up to 40 cm accounts for 5.6%, 23%, and 12% in the P. australis, K. candel, and A. marina communities, respectively, with a corresponding change in SOC storage of +3.5, -14, and -3.9 t C ha(-1). SOC storage did not follow the trend in aboveground biomass from the native to invasive species, or with vegetation types and invasion duration (7-15 years). SOC storage decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation (1000-1900 mm) and temperature (15.3-23.4celcius). Edaphic variables in P. australis marshes remained stable after S. alterniflora invasion, and hence, their effects on SOC content were absent. In mangrove wetlands, however, electrical conductivity, total N and phosphorus, pH, and active silicon were the main factors controlling SOC stocks. Mangrove wetlands were most strongly impacted by S. alterniflora invasion and efforts are needed to focus on restoring native vegetation. By understanding the mechanisms and consequences of invasion by S. alterniflora, changes in blue C sequestration can be predicted to optimize storage can be developed.

TI  - Factors influencing blue carbon accumulation across a 32-year chronosequence of created coastal marshes
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

TI  - Seasonal Species Variation of Sediment Organic Carbon Stocks in Salt Marshes of Tuticorin Area, Southern India
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing attention in global blue carbon investigation in these contemporary times, salt marsh has the distinctive importance in coastal ecosystems. We examined sediment organic carbon stock in the four dominant salt marsh species areas viz. Suaeda maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Salicornia brachiata from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India in two seasons i.e. dry (July 2015) and wet season (January 2016). We examined above ground (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB), sediment physico-chemical properties like pH, BD, composition, OM%, C-org%, C and N%, sediment organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and multivariate analysis on studied variables. Maximum AGB was recorded in A. indicum in both dry and wet season (10.91 +/- 0.15g/cm(2) and 14.87 +/- 0.68g/cm(2)). The highest BGB was observed in S. maritima in both seasons, as 2.01 +/- 0.35g/cm(2) and 4.49 +/- 0.35g/cm(2), respectively. The OM percentage ranged between 4.13 +/-.083 and 7.23 +/-.088% and the highest was observed in the wet season from S. maritima. Sediment organic stocks (Mgha (-1)) ranged from 8.42 +/-.640 to 54.46 +/- 1.46Mgha (-1) reflects nearly 7 times higher than the dry season. The present study can be useful for the estimation of blue carbon budgets in tropical coastal ecosystem since this type was the first hand information from this area.

TI  - Imbalanced nitrogen-phosphorus input alters soil organic carbon storage and mineralisation in a salt marsh
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - A large imbalance in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs induced by anthropogenic activities is anticipated to profoundly influence soil carbon (C) budgets in salt marshes. In this study, we hypothesized that imbalances in the nitrogen-phosphorus (N-P) input would result in the nonlinear response of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, fractions and mineralization to the N-P input ratio. We applied three N-P input ratios (low (5:1), medium (15:1), high (45:1)) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) for four years (in which N added increased from 8.67 to 26.01 g N m(-2) y(-1) and P added decreased from 1.73 to 0.58 g P m(-2) y(-1)) and quantified their impacts on SOC fractions and SOC mineralisation. The control treatment did not receive fertilization. The results showed that the N and P input led to overall increases in the availability of soil nutrients (i.e., inorganic N (IN) and available P (AP)), stimulation of plant biomass and changes of microbial community structure (i.e., gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). N and P input increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and decreased aromatic DOC components through improving N availability and stimulating plant growth. Notably, though, there may be a threshold N-P input ratio between 15:1 and 45:1 that, once crossed, triggers the loss of SOC. Appropriate increase in N availability induced by low and medium N-P input ratios would stimulate the SOC mineralization. However, excessive N-P input ratio would reduce SOC mineralization. Path analysis indicated that N-P input ratios dominantly regulate SOC mineralisation by changing soil DOC and microbial biomass (MBC)contents and microbial community structure. Thus, we speculate that the continuous increase in N input causes a growing N-P imbalance that reduces SOC stocks, despite a reduction in SOC mineralisation.

TI  - Aboveground Allometric Models for Freeze-Affected Black Mangroves (Avicennia germinans): Equations for a Climate Sensitive Mangrove-Marsh Ecotone
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the globe, species distributions are changing in response to climate change and land use change. In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of A. germinans at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events. Coastal scientists in the southeastern United States can use the identified allometric equations, in combination with easily obtained and non-destructive plant volume measurements, to better quantify and monitor ecological change within the dynamic, climate sensitive, and highly-productive mangrove-marsh ecotone.

TI  - Soil metal pollution assessment in Sarcocornia salt marshes in a South American estuary
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil metal pollution in two Sarcocornia salt marshes within the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, South America) was evaluated through pseudo-total and bioavailable metal levels and pollution indexes. Soil conditions were also studied. The pseudo-total metal concentrations were similar in both salt marshes and followed the same decreasing order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd. Bioavailable metals presented different patterns between salt marshes. The percentages of the bioavailable fraction varied between 28 and 80%, being higher than 60% for Cu, Zn and Pb. Organic matter ruled the distribution of all metals, except Pb. Using shale average concentration as background level, indexes did not show pollution nor enrichment, whereas using as background levels local values, anthropogenic enrichment was found for all metals and most metals showed moderate metal pollution. Our results showed that bioavailable metals levels and indexes using local background values provide an adequate assessment of metal pollution in salt marsh soils.

TI  - Soil organic carbon stocks in a tidal marsh landscape are dominated by human marsh embankment and subsequent marsh progradation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal and estuarine ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.

TI  - Contributions of mineral and organic components to tidal freshwater marsh accretion
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical accretion in tidal marshes is necessary to prevent submergence due to rising sea levels. Mineral materials may be more important in driving vertical accretion in tidal freshwater marshes, which are found near the heads of estuaries, than has been reported for salt marshes. Accretion rates for tidal freshwater marshes in North America and Europe (n = 76 data points) were compiled from the literature. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses revealed that both organic and mineral accumulations played a role in driving tidal freshwater marsh vertical accretion rates, although a unit mass of organic material contributed similar to 4 times more to marsh volume than the same mass input of mineral material. Despite the higher mineral content of tidal freshwater marsh soils, this ability of organic matter to effectively hold water and air in interstitial spaces suggests that organic matter is responsible for 62% of marsh accretion, with the remaining 38% from mineral contributions. The organic material that helps to build marsh elevation is likely a combination of in situ production and organic materials that are deposited in association with mineral sediment particles. Regional differences between tidal freshwater marshes in the importance of organic vs. mineral contributions may reflect differences in sediment availability, climate, tidal range, rates of sea level rise, and local-scale factors such as site elevation and distance to tidal creeks. Differences in the importance of organic and mineral accumulations between tidal freshwater and salt marshes are likely due to a combination of factors, including sediment availability (e.g., proximity to upland sources and estuarine turbidity maxima) and the lability of freshwater vs. salt marsh plant production.

TI  - Changes in soil organic matter quality during sea-influenced marsh soil development at the North Sea coast
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh soils sequester large amounts of organic matter (OM). The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - First report on carbon storage in a warm-temperate mangrove forest in South Africa
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) storage by vegetated coastal habitats (mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses) is globally recognized as a critical ecosystem service. Research efforts have therefore focused on quantifying C stored in these "blue carbon" ecosystems but a notable knowledge gap still exists for certain geographical regions. This study aimed to provide the first comprehensive assessment of C storage in South African warm temperate mangroves by quantifying the C storage in aboveground biomass and soil C pools associated with the mangrove forest at the Nxaxo Estuary. C storage variability was also related to mangrove forest structure and soil environmental variables. C storage was quantified using standardized protocols for aboveground (live trees, leaf litter, pneumatophores) and soil C pools at five Avicennia marina sites. The results showed soil C storage to be spatially variable while aboveground C pools were similar between intertidal zones within the sites. The soil C pool made the largest contribution to total C storage at each site and ranged from 176.91 +/- 4.5MgC.ha(-1) to 262.53 +/- 18.8 MgC. ha(-1). Of the aboveground carbon pools, live trees made the largest contribution and ranged from 2.25. 1.0 MgC.ha(-1) to 9.56 +/- 3.6 MgC.ha(-1). Across all sites, average C storage for all pools was 234.9 +/- 39.16 MgC.ha(-1), which falls within the range reported for mangroves at other southern hemisphere range limits. Variability in soil C was linearly related to soil organic matter but this relationship was inconsistent between different soil depth intervals that were sampled. Total C storage was inversely related to mangrove tree density. This study confirms the need for more blue carbon studies to quantify C storage in under-represented geographical areas and to investigate factors that drive variability in C storage at different spatial scales.

TI  - Comparison of biomass production and decomposition between Phragmites australis (common reed) and Spartina patens (salt hay grass) in brackish tidal marshes of New Jersey, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent expansion of Phragmites australis (common reed) from the marsh-upland interface into high marsh zones provides an opportunity to assess the impact of individual plant species on biomass production and decomposition in salt marshes. Seasonal harvests of aboveground and belowground biomass demonstrate that annual production of P. australis is approximately three times greater for aboveground biomass, two times greater for belowground biomass, and 30% lower in root: shoot ratio than neighboring populations of S. patens. Whole-plant litter (stems and leaves) also decomposes at a much slower annual rate for P. australis (k = 0.25) than S patens litter (k = 0.57). By crossing litter type with site of litter decomposition, I found these plant species to influence decay rates through litter type and not through their effects on marsh surface conditions (e.g., temperature, sedimentation rates). Based on these calculations, annual rates of carbon accumulation in the peat of high marshes are likely to increase 5-fold once P. australis becomes established due to its greater rates of biomass production and residence time in infrequently flooded brackish marshes.

TI  - Hydrologic Export Is a Major Component of Coastal Wetland Carbon Budgets
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO(2)with the atmosphere (NEE = -185 g C m(2)year(-1), negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87-110 g C m(2)year(-1)), suggesting only 47-59% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017-2018 showed NEE of -255 g C m(-2) year(-1), and hydrologic export of 105 g C m(-2) year(-1)(59% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.

TI  - Seasonal Dynamics of Trace Elements in Tidal Salt Marsh Soils as Affected by the Flow-Sediment Regulation Regime
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil profiles were collected in three salt marshes with different plant species (i.e. Phragmites australis, Tamarix chinensis and Suaeda salsa) in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China during three seasons (summer and fall of 2007 and the following spring of 2008) after the flow-sediment regulation regime. Total elemental contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate temporal variations in trace elements in soil profiles of the three salt marshes, assess the enrichment levels and ecological risks of these trace elements in three sampling seasons and identify their influencing factors. Trace elements did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in T. chinensis wetland. Compared to other elements, both Cd and As had higher enrichment factors exceeding moderate enrichment levels. However, the toxic unit (TU) values of these trace elements did not exceed probable effect levels. Correlation analysis showed that these trace elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture, sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values. Principal component analysis showed that the sampling season affected by the flow-sediment regulation regime was the dominant factor influencing the distribution patterns of these trace elements in soils, and plant community type was another important factor. The findings of this study could contribute to wetland conservation and management in coastal regions affected by the hydrological engineering.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasion impacts denitrifying community diversity and functioning in marsh soils
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate soil denitrifying bacterial and fungal community structures and potential denitrification rates in the coastal marsh soils of Eastern China across Spartina alterniflora invasive gradients (i.e. native (Nat), native-Spartina coexisted (Ecot) and Spartina-dominated (Mono) vegetations, respectively). Plant biomass and soil chemical properties were also analyzed to understand the patterns of spatial variability of structure and function of denitrifier communities across the studied gradients. Results indicated that total, bacterial and fungal potential denitrification rates (TDR, BDR and FDR) were 5.5, 3.5 and 1.5 times greater respectively in the Mono soil than in the Nat soil. Denitrifying bacterial richness, evenness and alpha-diversity were 2.0, 1.3 and 1.3 times greater in the Mono soil than those in the Nat soil, while only the richness among denitrifying fungal community parameters was 1.4 times greater in the Mono soil than that in the Nat soil. Plant biomass, soil organic carbon and pH were the most important factors influencing denitrifying bacterial and fungal community structures and functions. Denitrifying bacterial community composition was related closely to BDR and TDR, while denitrifying fungal community composition was not related to FDR and TDR, thus showing that the denitrifying bacterial community is a better predictor of denitrification function following Spartina invasion.

TI  - Respirations and Response in Temperature of Salt Marsh Soil in Different Types of Wetlands Along the Coast of Yancheng
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration rates (SRR) of the salt marsh soils in the wetlands under different types of vegetation, i.e. Phragmites australis (PHS), Spartina alternillora (SPS) and Suaeda salsa (SUS) along the coast of Yancheng were determined separately in the field and soil samples collected for laboratory incubation and measurement of respiration rates at specific temperatures, and further for analyses of soil responses to changing temperature in respiration. Results show that: (1) during the experiment period, the salt marsh soils were sources of CO2. The mean SRR under PHS, SPS and SUS was 323. 67, 499. 51 and 150. 41 mg.m(-2).h(-1), respectively. The Stills followed a seasonal rhythm of summer > spring > autumn.

TI  - Degradation of RDX (Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) in contrasting coastal marine habitats: Subtidal non-vegetated (sand), subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), and intertidal marsh
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

AB  - Hundreds of explosive-contaminated marine sites exist globally, many of which contain the common munitions constituent hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Quantitative information about RDX transformation in coastal ecosystems is essential for management of many of these sites. Isotopically labelled RDX containing N-15 in all 3 nitro groups was used to track the fate of RDX in three coastal ecosystem types. Flow-through mesocosms representing subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), subtidal non-vegetated (sand) and intertidal marsh ecosystems were continuously loaded with isotopically labelled RDX for 16-17 days. Sediment, pore-water and overlying surface water were analyzed to determine the distribution of RDX, nitroso-triazine transformation products (NXs) and nitrogen containing complete mineralization products, including ammonium, nitrate - nitrite, nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas. The marsh, silt, and sand ecotypes transformed 94%, 90% and 76% of supplied RDX, respectively. Total dissolved NXs accounted for 2%-4% of the transformed N-15-RDX. The majority of RDX transformation in the water column was by mineralization to inorganic N (dissolved and evaded; 64%-78% of transformed N-15-RDX). RDX was mineralized primarily to N2O (62-74% of transformed 15 N-RDX) and secondarily to N-2 (1-2% of transformed N-15-RDX) which exchanged with the atmosphere. Transformation of RDX was favored in carbon-rich lower redox potential sediments of the silt and marsh mesocosms where anaerobic processes of iron and sulfate reduction were most prevalent. RDX was most persistent in the carbon-poor sand mesocosm. Partitioning of N-15 derived from RDX onto sediment and suspended particulates was negligible in the overall mass balance of RDX transformation (2%-3% of transformed N-15-RDX). The fraction of N-15 derived from RDX that was sorbed or assimilated in sediment was largest in the marsh mesocosm (most organic carbon). and smallest in the sand mesocosm (largest grain size and least organic carbon). Sediment redox conditions and available organic carbon stores affect the fate of RDX in different coastal marine habitats. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tidal marsh restoration enhances sediment accretion and carbon accumulation in the Stillaguamish River estuary, Washington
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes have been recognized globally for their ability to sequester "blue carbon" but there is still a need for studies investigating the marsh response to restoration, particularly in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we report carbon stocks and accumulation rates for restored and natural tidal marshes in the Stillaguamish River estuary in Puget Sound, Washington, where a 60-hectare marsh was reintroduced to the tidal regime from its previous use as diked and drained farmland. We found that the restoration not only maximized carbon accumulation but also enhanced resilience to rising sea levels. Four years after restoration, mean sediment carbon stocks in the upper 30 cm within the restored marsh (4.43 kg C m(-2)) were slightly lower than those measured in the adjacent natural marshes (5.95 kg C m(-2)). Mean carbon accumulation rates, however, were nearly twice as high in the restored marsh (230.49 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the natural marshes (123.00 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) due to high rates of accretion in the restored marsh (1.57 cm yr(-1)). Mean elevation change rates were nearly twice that of corresponding Pb-210 accretion rates, but all were greater than the current rate of sea level rise.

TI  - Dredging Impacts on Soil Properties of the Kankakee River System 150 Years after Perturbation
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater marshes provide ecosystem services such as improving water quality by storing water and filtering nutrients from upland runoff, minimizing erosion and flooding by reducing stream and river velocity and peak flows, and carbon sequestration by storing organic matter for long extended periods of time. These ecosystem services have increased interest in the protection and restoration of marshes and soil properties and are an important consideration for successful restoration. This study was conducted in Indiana, USA, within the historical extent of the Grand Kankakee Marsh that once encompassed 202,343 ha, until the dredging of the Kankakee River from 1852 to 1917 to convert the marsh to cropland. Current (in 2019) soil properties (organic matter mass and concentration, bulk density, moisture content, and carbonate concentration) were compared between (1) marshes that were dredged and presently in other land-use categories such as cropland and forests, and (2) remnant marshes that were not impacted by dredging. On average, organic matter mass and concentration were not significantly different between dredged areas and marshes (p > 0.05). However, marshes tended to have lower bulk densities, greater moisture contents, and greater carbonate concentrations compared to dredged areas. The soil properties of remnant marshes in this study can be used to evaluate the success of marsh restoration efforts in regions with similar soils, climate, and land-use history.

TI  - Impacts of land reclamation on tidal marsh 'blue carbon' stocks
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marsh ecosystems are among earth's most efficient natural organic carbon (C) sinks and provide myriad ecosystem services. However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

TI  - Biogeochemical value of managed realignment, Humber estuary, UK
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We outline a plausible, albeit extreme, managed realignment scenario ('Extended Deep Green' scenario) for a large UK estuary to demonstrate the maximum possible biogeochemical effects and economic outcomes of estuarine management decisions. Our interdisciplinary approach aims to better inform the policy process, by combining biogeochemical and socioeconomic components of managed realignment schemes. Adding 7494 ha of new intertidal area to the UK Humber estuary through managed realignment leads to the annual accumulation of a 1.2 x 10(5) t of 'new' sediment and increases the current annual sink of organic C and N, and particle reactive P in the estuary by 150%, 83% and 50%, respectively. The increase in intertidal area should also increase denitrification. However, this positive outcome is offset by the negative effect of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions in new marshes in the low salinity region of the estuary. Short-term microbial reactions decrease the potential benefits Of CO2 sequestration through gross organic carbon burial by at least 50%. Net carbon storage is thus most effective where oxidation and denitrification reactions are reduced. In the Humber this translates to wet, saline marshes at the seaward end of estuaries. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to determine the economic efficiency of the Extended Deep Green managed realignment. When compared to a 'Hold-the-Line' future scenario, i.e. the present state/extent of sea defences in the estuary, the CBA shows that managed realignment is cost effective when viewed on > 25 year timescales. This is because capital costs are incurred in the first years, whereas the benefits from habitat creation, carbon sequestration and reduced maintenance costs build up over time. Over 50- and 100-year timescales, the Extended Deep Green managed realignment scenario is superior in efficiency terms. The increased sediment accumulation is also likely to enhance storage of contaminant metals. In the case of Cu, a metal that currently causes significant water quality issues, Cu removal due to burial of suspended sediment in realigned areas translates to a value of approximately 1000 pound a(-1) (avoided clean up costs). Although this is not formally included in the,CBA it illustrates another likely positive economic outcome of managed realignment. Although we focus on the Humber, the history of reclamation and its biogeochemistry is common to many estuaries in northern Europe. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanisms of soil organic carbon storage response to Spartina altemiflora invasion and climate change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands have been identified as vital global carbon (C) sinks; however, soil C sequestration in these ecosystems is susceptible to impacts of non-native species invasion and climate change worldwide. Although their potential impacts on soil organic C (SOC) storage have been reported in previous literature, the well-established mechanisms that control SOC storage response, especially in relation to soil depths, is still limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a structural equation model (SEM) to identify mechanisms that account for SOC changes in topsoil (0-03 m) and subsoil (0.3-0.6 m) on coastal wetland of the East China Sea, where SOC in both depths increased with exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion. In the initial model, we hypothesized that there were a set of direct and indirect effects of the invasion, climate, and soil physicochemical properties on SOC storage. By evaluating the interactions of these factors, we found relatively complex patterns that vary with depth. For topsoil, the invasion had not only direct effects on SOC storage, but also indirect effects through mediating effects of soil water content (SWC) that was linked to fine soil fractions. For subsoil, the invasion was indirectly related to SOC storage through mediating effects of SOC in topsoil, SWC, and salinity. SOC in subsoil was also affected by temperature. Our results highlight that the response of SOC storage to the invasion and climate change results from the interacting effects of climate-plant-soil system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characteristics of sedimentary environments in brackish marsh soils in relation to organic matter properties (Puck Lagoon, Northern Poland)
T2  - Ecological Questions
M3  - Article
AB  - The research focused on brackish marsh soils located within the coastal zone of Puck Lagoon (the Beka botanical and ornithological nature reserve). They are characterised by the presence of layers rich with allochthonous organic matter, derived from washing out of peat deposits. The objective of the research was to determine sedimentary environments of the soil organic matter based on selected properties. The obtained results indicated that despite similar morphological characteristics, these soils might have developed in slightly different environmental conditions, determined mostly by the Baltic water levels and morphology of the coast. The organic matter of the studied soils was characterised by relatively low aromaticity, which may indicate the ongoing process of decomposition. The presence of both peat-bog, rush and ruderal plants, as well as trees in the species composition of macroremains proved the heterogeneity of sedimentary environments and confirmed the allochthonous origin of organic matter accumulated in the studied brackish marsh soils.

TI  - Can macroalgae contribute to blue carbon? An Australian perspective
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Macroalgal communities in Australia and around the world store vast quantities of carbon in their living biomass, but their prevalence of growing on hard substrata means that they have limited capacity to act as long-term carbon sinks. Unlike other coastal blue carbon habitats such as seagrasses, saltmarshes and mangroves, they do not develop their own organic-rich sediments, but may instead act as a rich carbon source and make significant contributions in the form of detritus to sedimentary habitats by acting as a "carbon donor" to "receiver sites" where organic material accumulates. The potential for storage of this donated carbon however, is dependent on the decay rate during transport and the burial efficiency at receiver sites. To better understand the potential contribution of macroalgal communities to coastal blue carbon budgets, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using key words, including carbon sequestration, macroalgal distribution, abundance and productivity to provide an estimation of the total amount of carbon stored in temperate Australian macroalgae. Our most conservative calculations estimate 109.9 TgC is stored in living macroalgal biomass of temperate Australia, using a coastal area covering 249,697 km(2). Estimates derived for tropical and subtropical regions contributed an additional 23.2 Tg C. By extending the search to include global studies we provide a broader context and rationale for the study, contributing to the global aspects of the review. In addition, we discuss the potential role of calcium carbonate-containing macroalgae, consider the dynamic nature of macroalgal populations in the context of climate change, and identify the knowledge gaps that once addressed will enable robust quantification of macroalgae in marine biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We conclude that macroalgal communities have the potential to make ecologically meaningful contributions toward global blue carbon sequestration, as donors, but given that the fate of detached macroalgal biomass remains unclear, further research is needed to quantify this contribution.

TI  - Oxygen Consumption and Sulfate Reduction in Vegetated Coastal Habitats: Effects of Physical Disturbance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs), such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, have the ability to capture and store carbon in the sediment for millennia, and thus have high potential for mitigating global carbon emissions. Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.

TI  - Importance of the fiddler crab Uca pugnax to salt marsh soil organic matter accumulation
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential influence of fiddler crab burrow density on the processes controlling organic matter (OM) accumulation was examined in Virginia salt marshes. As burrows may affect important chemical and biological processes that influence belowground plant production and decomposition, experimental manipulations were designed to modify fiddler crab burrow density by either increasing them (artificially constructed holes) or decreasing them (exclosures) and comparing them to areas naturally with and without fiddler crab burrows. The only significant difference among treatments was associated with the presence of holes without regard for whether they were artificial or natural. Higher burrow density resulted in an increase in soil redox potential, which most likely caused higher decomposition, even though sulfate-reduction rates were not different among treatments. Belowground production decreased with increased burrow density resulting in less OM addition to the soil. Higher decomposition and lower belowground production resulted in a net loss of 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in marshes with higher burrow densities, while areas with few to no burrows accumulated up to 245 g C m(-2) yr(-1), equaling a surface accretion rate of 4 mm yr(-1). Examination of 6 other salt marshes in the region revealed a negative correlation between fiddler crab density and soil OM content, lending strength to the argument that bioturbation is a potentially important explanatory factor of OM accumulation in salt marshes and may influence how sea level rise impacts coastal marshes.

TI  - Dataset: Carbon accumulation rates in a salt marsh over the past two millennia
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - High rates of carbon burial observed in wetland sediments have garnered attention as a potential "natural fix" to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earths atmosphere. A carbon accumulation rate (CAR) can be determined through various methods that integrate a carbon stock over different time periods, ranging from decades to millennia. Our goal was to assess how CAR changed over the lifespan of a salt marsh. We applied a geochronology to a series of salt marsh cores using both 14C and 21p less than 0.b markers to calculate CARs that were integrated between 35 to 2,46p less than 0.years before present. CAR was 39 g C m -2  y -1  when integrated over millennia, but was upwards of 148 g C m -2  y -1  for the past century. We present additional evidence to account for this variability by linking it to changes in relative sea-level rise (RSLR), where higher rates of RSLR were associated with higher CARs. Thus, the true CAR calculated for a wetland should integrate recent timescales that capture the influence of contemporary RSLR, but must also omit recently deposited labile organic carbon that will ultimately decompose. Therefore, caution should be exercised not to utilize a CAR calculated over inappropriate time scales as a current assessment or forecasting tool for the climate change mitigation potential of a wetland.

TI  - Sulphate reduction as a geomorphological agent in tidal marshes ('great marshes' at Barnstable, Cape Cod, USA)
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many tidal marsh surfaces feature water-filled depressions, known as salt pans (shallow) or ponds (deeper). In the great Marshes at Barnstable, Cape God, pond formation is an active process. We hypothesize that degradation of organic matter by sulphate-reducing bacteria in these peat-rich marsh deposits is the primary cause of pan and pond formation. Sulphate reduction below an actively developing pond is probably enhanced by higher temperature and salinity of the pond water. Computer simulation suggests that ponds with similar characteristics to those in the Barnstable marshes may develop by sulphate reduction. Necessary conditions are sufficiently deep percolation and diffusion of sulphate into the underlying marsh deposits, and a high decomposition rate stimulated by high water temperatures in the ponds. In areas with a high density of ponds, drainage of the ponds by headward erosion of tidal creeks may cause rapid disintegration of the marsh surface. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this chapter humic substances (HS) from salt marsh soils are characterized by two spectroscopic techniques single-scan fluorescence and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy The studied soils cover a transitional gradient from predominantly marine to predominantly terrestrial environments a tidal flat vegetated by Spartina maritima (TF) a salt marsh covered by Juncus maritimus (SM) and a grassland in a active polder (GL)Differences in the characteristics of the HS from the three soils are detected, which may be attributed not only to the composition of the original organic material but also to environmental factors HS from TF show the lowest degree of humification and a large amount of nonpolar aliphatic components, pointing to a predominant contribution of organic materials from marine and/or microbial sources In the SM soil the suboxic conditions and the high biomass from the vegetation cover led to the accumulation of relatively fresh OM and, consequently, to a low degree of humification of the HS The HS in the GL display the highest degrees of humification and aromaticity, which may have been enhanced by the aeration and drainage of the soil by the reclamation processThe results indicate that a wide number of factors must be considered in studying organic matter characteristics in salt marshes since they are highly variable systems at both temporal and spatial levels

TI  - EFFECT OF INCREASED NITROGEN AVAILABILITY ON SOIL ENZYME PERFORMANCE IN WETLANDS OF NORTHEAST CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the enhanced organic matter decomposition induced by climate warming as well as increased external nitrogen (N) inputs, increased soil N availability in wetlands can alter soil enzyme activities and hence ecosystem C dynamics. An incubation experiment was conducted to assess the effects of increased N availability on soil enzyme activities in freshwater marsh and peatland of Northeast China. N was added as ammonium nitrate solution at four levels (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg N/g soil for N0, N1, N2, and N3, respectively). Results showed that the effect of N availability increasing on soil enzyme activities varied with soil types, fertilization rates, and incubation times. Increased N availability inhibited urease activity in marsh soils throughout the incubation, whereas N2 and N3 treatments suppressed urease activity in peat soils only at 6 days. Marsh soil invertase activity increased after 15 days of incubation because of N addition. N availability increasing stimulated the peat soil protease activity initially, but negative effect was observed at the end of incubation. In both soils, increased N availability had no effect on acid phosphatase except for N3 treatment at 27 days. With increased N addition levels, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased in marsh soils, but did not change in peat soils. These findings suggest that, in marsh ecosystems, increased N availability alters soil urease and invertase activities and DOC pool, and thus changes the soil organic C dynamics. However, soil urease and DOC are not sensitive to N availability increasing in peat soils.

TI  - Characterizing spatial variability in coastal wetland biomass across multiple scales using UAV and satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland biomass is an important indicator of wetland productivity, carbon storage, health, and vulnerability to climate change. The ability to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in wetlands at ecologically relevant scales is complicated by the spatial variability inherent to patterns in wetland vegetation and the biogeomorphic processes that help create them. Remote sensing provides an approach for mapping wetland biomass, but the spatial resolutions of satellite and airborne imagery often constrain the types of ecological patterns and processes that can be detected. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have previously been used to capture fine-scale (<= 1 m) variability in AGB in coastal wetland settings. However, it remains unclear if a UAV approach to estimating wetland biomass is transferrable across diverse wetland sites or how it compares to commonly used satellite-based approaches. Here, we test the capabilities of UAVs in remotely quantifying AGB and compare biomass estimation using UAV and Landsat satellite imagery (30 m resolution) in several wetland sites in Southern California. Field surveys highlight significant spatial variability in wetland plant community AGB and height that influence remote biomass estimation. Relationships between UAV vegetation indices and AGB were site-specific and influenced by vegetation types. Biomass estimation using UAVs (r(2) = 0.40, RMSE = 534.6 g m(-2)) showed better correlation with NDVI than a Landsatbased approach (r(2) = 0.26, RMSE = 596.8 g m(-2)). We found combining high-resolution UAV AGB maps and Landsat NDVI to develop AGB models showed the highest correlation (r(2) = 0.45, RMSE = 659.7 g m(-2)) and provided additional spatial information to aid scaling field data to satellite imagery. Overall, UAVs captured more spatial complexity in aboveground biomass at finer scales than is possible with moderate-resolution Landsat pixels, indicating that UAVs can be used to characterize patterns of within-marsh variability resulting from local-scale (<= 100s of meters) ecological processes.

TI  - Australian vegetated coastal ecosystems as global hotspots for climate change mitigation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Policies aiming to preserve vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE; tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions require national assessments of blue carbon resources. Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon in tidal wetland soils of the continental United States
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands contain large reservoirs of carbon in their soils and can sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) at a greater rate per unit area than nearly any other ecosystem. The spatial distribution of this carbon influences climate and wetland policy. To assist with international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement, national-level assessments such as the United States (U.S.) National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and regional, state, local, and project-level evaluation of CO2 sequestration credits, we developed a geodatabase (CoBluCarb) and high-resolution maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution by linking National Wetlands Inventory data with the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database. For over 600,000 wetlands, the total carbon stock and organic carbon density was calculated at 5-cm vertical resolution from 0 to 300 cm of depth. Across the continental United States, there are 1,153-1,359 Tg of SOC in the upper 0-100 cm of soils across a total of 24945.9 km(2) of tidal wetland area, twice as much carbon as the most recent national estimate. Approximately 75% of this carbon was found in estuarine emergent wetlands with freshwater tidal wetlands holding about 19%. The greatest pool of SOC was found within the Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bay complex in Louisiana, containing about 10% of the U.S. total. The average density across all tidal wetlands was 0.071 g cm(-3) across 0-15 cm, 0.055 g cm(-3) across 0-100 cm, and 0.040 g cm(-3) at the 100 cm depth. There is inherent variability between and within individual wetlands; however, we conclude that it is possible to use standardized values at a range of 0-100 cm of the soil profile, to provide first-order quantification and to evaluate future changes in carbon stocks in response to environmental perturbations. This Tier 2-oriented carbon stock assessment provides a scientific method that can be copied by other nations in support of international requirements.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Development and Turnover in Natural and Disturbed Salt Marsh Environments
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh survival with sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly relies on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and preservation. Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (<= 1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (delta C-13), and age ((FC)-C-14) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented similar to 9%-17% of shallow SOC (<= 26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.Key Points.Salt marsh soils preserved compounds with a range of reactivities that were derived from local grasses9%-17% of surface soil carbon was old, likely reflecting redeposition of eroded creekbank materialDecomposition decreases soil organic carbon thermal reactivity, and disturbances accelerate this shift, particularly in surface horizons

TI  - Fresh and weathered crude oil effects on potential denitrification rates of coastal marsh soil
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil platform experienced an explosion which triggered the largest marine oil spill in US history, resulting in the release of similar to 795 million L of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Once oil reached the surface, changes in overall chemical composition occurred due to volatilization of the smaller carbon chain compounds as the oil was transported onshore by winds and currents. In this study, the toxic effects of both fresh and weathered crude oil on denitrification rates of coastal marsh soil were determined using soil samples collected from an unimpacted coastal marsh site proximal to areas that were oiled in Barataria Bay, LA. The 1:10 ratio of crude oil:field moist soil fully coated the soil surface mimicking a heavy oiling scenario. Potential denitrification rates at the 1:10 ratio, for weathered crude oil, were 46 +/- 18.4% of the control immediately after exposure and 62 +/- 8.0% of the control following a two week incubation period, suggesting some adaptation of the denitrifying microbial consortium over time. Denitrification rates of soil exposed to fresh crude oil were 51.5 +/- 5.3% of the control after immediate exposure and significantly lower at 10.9 +/- 1.1% after a 2 week exposure period. Results suggest that fresh crude oil has the potential to more severely impact the important marsh soil process of denitrification following longer term exposure. Future studies should focus on longer-term denitrification as well as changes in the microbial consortia in response to oil exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Invasive Phragmites Increases Blue Carbon Stock and Soil Volume in a St. Lawrence Estuary Marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services.

TI  - Evaluation of coastal wetland soil properties in a degrading marsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes consist of a mosaic of vegetated and open water features, which naturally evolve and change over time. However, the rapid expansion of open water areas has been associated with marsh degradation and there is a growing need for detailed studies as coastal wetlands continue to degrade under increasing rates of sea level rise and related stressors. Yet, few studies investigate soil physicochemical and biogeochemical properties within different marsh landscape features, which could provide insight into mechanisms of the formation and expansion of open water areas. The current study compared wetland soil physical and microbial properties observed in vegetated areas with shallow open water areas called panties, identifying a number of significant differences. Panne soils possessed lower bulk density, total C, N, P, SOC, DOC, and SRP compared with vegetated marsh areas, suggesting a shift in nutrient pools as vegetated areas transition into shallow open water features. Panne features also displayed significantly lower microbial pool sizes and processing rates than vegetated marsh soils, suggesting reduced capacity for nutrient processing in open water areas. Further, extractable NH4-N was highest in the panne soils suggesting that the absence of macrophytes decreased N uptake in open water areas. Also related to the lack of vascular plants, extractable DOC in panties averaged less than half the concentration found in vegetated marsh areas, despite a smaller difference in soil total C. Results underscore the importance of incorporating heterogeneous landscape soil conditions when evaluating marsh degradation and considering potential restoration activities.

TI  - Atmospheric Ammonia Measurements Over a Coastal Salt Marsh Ecosystem Along the Mid-Atlantic US
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations and fluxes are limited in coastal regions in the eastern U.S. In this study, continuous and high temporal resolution measurements (5s) of atmospheric NH3 concentrations were recorded using a cavity ring-down spectrometer in a temperate tidal salt marsh at the St Jones Reserve (Dover, DE). Micrometeorological variables were measured using an eddy covariance system which is part of the AmeriFlux network (US-StJ). Soil, plant, and water chemistry were also analyzed to characterize the sources and sinks of atmospheric NH3. A new analytical methodology was used to estimate the average ecosystem-scale diurnal cycle of NH3 fluxes by replicating the characteristics of a chamber experiment. This virtual chamber approach estimates positive surface fluxes in continuing strongly stable conditions when mixing with the air above is minimal. Our findings show that tidal water level may have a significant impact on NH3 emissions from the marsh. The largest fluxes were observed at low tide when more soil was exposed. While it is expected that NH3 fluxes will peak when the air temperature maximizes, high tide occurred concurrently with midday peaks in solar irradiance led to a decrease in NH3 fluxes. Furthermore, soil, plant, and water chemistry measurements underpinning the NH3 concentrations and fluxes lead us to conclude that this coastal wetland ecosystem can act as either a sink or a source of NH3. Such measurements provide novel data on which we can base reliable parameterizations to simulate NH3 emissions from coastal salt marsh ecosystems using surface-atmosphere transfer models.Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands such as salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses provide a natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. As a fertilizer, nitrogen (N) increases the vegetative growth and thus more CO2 may be fixed in plants as biomass representing the short-term storage pool of carbon, therefore reducing its atmospheric level. Salt marshes, in particular, have been identified as being highly effective at carbon sequestration as well as adsorbing and transforming N. However, there are limited atmospheric measurements of ammonia (NH3) concentrations and exchanges in coastal areas of the Eastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. This pilot study represents one of the few atmospheric measurements of NH3 over temperate tidal salt marshes in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. The high temporal resolution measurements of NH3 concentrations indicated that local sources, such as agriculture and industry, may have a considerable impact on the local atmospheric NH3 concentrations. The results also show that tidal water levels in salt marshes may have a significant effect on NH3 emissions.

TI  - CO-2 EMISSION AND SOIL EH RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS IN FRESH, BRACKISH, AND SALINE MARSH SOILS
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of various water-table depths during continuous and simulated tidal drainage on CO2 emissions and soil Eh were examined in intact fresh, brackish, and saline marsh soil cores. CO2 emissions did not differ between continuous and tidal drainage. CO2 emissions were greatest in fresh cores and least in brackish cores at all water-table depths tested. Eh was higher in brackish cores and lower in fresh and saline cores at all water-table depths tested. Eh increased with decreasing water-table depth and increased more during continuous drainage than during tidal drainage. These results exclude the possibility that reported differences in field measurements of CO2 emission among fresh, brackish, and saline marsh soils relate to different hydrological conditions in the marsh types; they also indicate that fundamental differences in decomposition processes and soil Eh exist among these marsh types. Although not tested, differences were attributed to the different species of emergent vegetation occupying the different marsh types and which are the sources of soil organic matter.

TI  - Net ecosystem carbon exchange and the greenhouse gas balance of tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are productive ecosystems with the capacity to sequester large amounts of carbon (C), but we know relatively little about the impact of climate change on wetland C cycling in lower salinity (oligohaline and tidal freshwater) coastal marshes. In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of Fluctuating Salinity on Potential Denitrification in Coastal Wetland Soil and Sediments
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal wetlands of southern Louisiana provide an ideal environment for removing nitrate (NO3-) from the Mississippi River before discharge into the Gulf of Mexico where it can contribute to hypoxia. However, denitrification, the primary mechanism of excess N removal, may be sensitive to the fluctuating salinities that characterize coastal wetlands. Salinity can shift from salt to fresh during river inflows, or from fresh to salt during storm surge events. This study investigated the impact of shifting salinity on potential denitrification rates in marsh soils and bayou sediments from the fresh and salt marshes of Brenton Sound estuary. Potential denitrification rates were quantified using bottle incubations for both short-term (2 d), and longer-term (11 d) studies. Fresh marsh sites had higher denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), but all soils and sediments achieved high denitrification when exposed to ideal conditions. Pulses of freshwater (0 ppt) in salt marsh soils decreased potential denitrification rates by 98% for an 11-d study, indicating the rapid opening of a freshwater diversion could significantly reduce that ability of coastal wetlands to provide significant nutrient-removal before discharge to the coastal ocean. Pulses of intermediate salinity (15 ppt) water stimulated denitrification rates in the fresh marsh soil by 75%, while full salinity seawater (35 ppt) suppressed potential denitrification by 73% for 11 d. This research demonstrates the sensitivity of the denitrifying microbial consortia to rapid shifts in salinity and this information can be used to guide water managers on maximizing NO3- removal in Mississippi River surface water diversions.

TI  - Assessing the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of the semi-natural salt marshes in the European Wadden Sea
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.

TI  - LargeCO(2)release and tidal flushing in salt marsh crab burrows reduce the potential for blue carbon sequestration
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on vertical soil organic carbon distribution and storage amount in coastal salt marshes in Jiangsu, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in global carbon sequestration, and exotic S. alterniflora affects the coastal ecosystem's functions including SOC storage (SOCS). We investigated the vertical deep soil SOC distribution (0-300 cm) in Jiangsu salt marsh and estimated its changes. The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora. The deepest SOC distribution (180 cm) and the highest SOC content (2.14 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1)) in the deep layer( 50-300 cm) were found in the zones where S. salsa - S. alterniflora co-exist (SSI). The vertical SOC distribution in zones where multi-species co-exists is deeper than that in mono-species dominated zones; (2) The deep soil (100-300 cm) SOC accounts more than 50% of 0-300 cm SOC in Jiangsu salt marsh, suggesting that SOC content of deep soil should not be ignored when calculating the global soil carbon stock; (3) Total SOCS within 0-300 cm in Jiangsu salt marshes (107.84 x 10(6) m(2)) is 84.90 x 10(10) g, of which 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm and 200-300 cm layer accounts for 38.25%, 30.72% and 31.03%, respectively. The size of the SOCS (0-300 cm) in the Jiangsu salt marshes relatively to the global biome (0.36 x 10(-6)) is in a lower proportion of the range of salt marsh area to global biome area (0.89 x 10(-6)). The S. alterniflora salt marsh contributes most of the SOCS in the 0-300 cm and 0-100 cm soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrogen input weakens the control of inundation frequency on soil organic carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity of salt marshes is of considerable importance with respect to the mitigatiing the potentially detrimental consequences of global climate change. Given that tidal salt marshes are subjected to periodic cycles of inundation, it is assumed that soil C cycle in these marshes is expected to be controlled to varing extent by changes in soil moisture and salinity induced by the alternating patterns of drying and rewetting. In addition, with increases in the extent and severity of nitrogen (N) eutrophication becomes serious, we predicted that soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in tidal salt marshes is likely to be highly responsive to increased N loading. In this study, we conducted a two-factor mesocosm experiment (simulated inundation and N input in a tidal salt marsh) to determine the interactive effects of N eutrophication and inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. Our results showed that increased inundation frequency led to lower levels of CO2 emission but greater CH4 emission, whereas N input weakened the effects of changes in inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions. Moreover, N input was found to modify CO2 and CH4 emission in response to variations in soil moisture. We also observed an enhancement of soil DOC loss in response to increasing inundation frequency, and that DOC loss in the surface soil was considerably greater than that in subsurface soil. Further, as inundation frequency increased, we detected changes in the relationship between soil DOC and CO2 and CH4. Our findings highlighted that vertical variation in soil moisture induced by inundation is a key factor controlling SOC loss in tidal salt marshes, although N input can weaken this control.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Sustainable Cultivation and Exploitation of Halophyte Crops in a Salinizing World
CL  - Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Habitats occupied by many halophytes are not only saline, but are also prone to flooding and yet surprisingly few studies have evaluated submergence tolerance in halophytes. Sediment, floodwater, and intra-plant O-2 dynamics were evaluated during tidal submergence for the leaf-succulent halophyte Suaeda maritime (L.) Dum. For S. maritime growing in soil just above the mud flat in a UK salt marsh, the soil was only moderately hypoxic just prior to tidal inundation, presumably owing to drainage and O-2 entry facilitated by frequent, large cracks. O-2 declined to very low levels following high tide. By contrast, mud flat sediment remained waterlogged, lacked cracks, and was anoxic. Plant O-2 dynamics were investigated using field-collected plants in sediment blocks transported to a controlled-submergence system in a glasshouse. Submergence during night-time resulted in anoxia within leaves, whereas during day-time O-2 was produced by underwater photosynthesis. The thin lateral roots of S. maritima presumably access some O-2 from hypoxic sediments, but could also experience transient episodes of severe hypokia/anoxia, especially as any internal O-2 movement from shoots would be small owing to the low gas-filled porosity in roots. Fermentative metabolism to lactate, producing some ATP in the absence of O-2, might contribute to tolerance of transient O-2 deficits. Lactate was high in root tissues, whereas ethanol production (tissue and incubation medium contents) was low, both in comparison with values reported for other species. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tolerance to transient waterlogging and submergence for the halophyte S. maritime growing in a tidal salt marsh. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Current and future carbon stocks in coastal wetlands within the Great Barrier Reef catchments
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9%-13% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4%-6% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5%-1.4% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

TI  - Tidal marsh biomass field plot and remote sensing datasets for six regions in the conterminous United States
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. We tested how plant community composition and vegetation structure differences across estuaries influence model development, and whether data from multiple sensors, in particular Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar and Landsat, can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n=409, RMSE=310 g/m2, 10.3% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass and carbon for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model error was reduced by scaling field measured biomass by Landsat fraction green vegetation derived from object-based classification of National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery. We generated 30m resolution biomass maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map for each region. With a mean plant %C of 44.1% (n=1384, 95% C.I.=43.99% - 44.37%) we estimated mean aboveground carbon densities (Mg/ha) and total carbon stocks for each wetland type for each region. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon estimates that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 &#61617;0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 &#61617;0.004 Mg/ha). This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included for the first time in the 2018 U.S. EPA National Greenhouse Gas Inventory for coastal wetlands. With the increased availability of cloud computing platforms and freely available software and post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global scale as well.These data include the tidal marsh biomass field plots and remote sensing datasets used to produced the aboveground tidal marsh biomass and plant carbon content (%C) estimates.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and storage in Norwegian Arctic coastal wetlands: Impacts of climate change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores.Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon distribution in restored and reference marshes at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge
T2  - Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are important for the ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay, east coast USA. They have the capacity to sequester large amounts of carbon as they accrete with sea-level rise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate carbon distributions in a marsh restored using coarse mineral and organic sediments in 2003 and a natural reference marsh. Soil cores were collected across transects in each marsh to a depth of 1 m. Samples were divided by horizon and analyzed for bulk density and carbon concentration. The restored marsh had wider ranges of bulk density and C concentrations due to the presence of both organic and mineral soil materials. Horizons from the restored marsh had a mean bulk density of 0.50 g cm(-3) while the reference marsh averaged 0.09 g cm(-3). Carbon concentrations were greater in the reference marsh (30%) than the restored marsh (13%). The average carbon content in the restored marsh was 35 kg m(-2) while the reference marsh has only 24 kg m(-2) due to a greater bulk density. New organic material deposited over the dredge material represents surface carbon accumulation of 1.8 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Evaluating restoration and carbon dynamics are difficult without knowledge of site characteristics prior to restoration.

TI  - Ecosystem Functions of Tidal Fresh, Brackish, and Salt Marshes on the Georgia Coast
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined patterns of habitat function (plant species richness), productivity (plant aboveground biomass and total C), and nutrient stocks (N and P in aboveground plant biomass and soil) in tidal marshes of the Satilla, Altamaha, and Ogeechee Estuaries in Georgia, USA. We worked at two sites within each salinity zone (fresh, brackish, and saline) in each estuary, sampling a transect from the creekbank to the marsh platform. In total, 110 plant species were found. Site-scale and plot-scale species richness decreased from fresh to saline sites. Standing crop biomass and total carbon stocks were greatest at brackish sites, followed by freshwater then saline sites. Nitrogen stocks in plants and soil decreased across sites as salinity increased, while phosphorus stocks did not differ between fresh and brackish sites but were lowest at salty sites. These results generally support past speculation about ecosystem change across the estuarine gradient, emphasizing that ecosystem function in tidal wetlands changes sharply across the relatively short horizontal distance of the estuary. Changes in plant distribution patterns driven by global changes such as sea level rise, changing climates, or fresh water withdrawal are likely to have strong impacts on a variety of wetland functions and services.

TI  - Distribution of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Stocks in Salt Marsh Wetland in Dongtan of Chongming
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh wetlands are important pools of carbon and nitrogen. Spatio-temporal distributions of the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks therein are affected by both biological and environmental factors. In this paper, spatio-temporal distribution and vertical distribution (0-50 cm) of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in the Dongtan wetlands during 2013 was studied. Results show that both the SOC and TN stocks varied seasonally, following an order of winter > autumn > summer > spring, and accumulated with the time passing by, and varied spatially, too, showing a decreasing order of Phagmites australis belt in high tidal marsh > Spartina alterniflora belt in medium-tidal marsh > Scirpus mariqueter belt in low-tidal marsh > bare mudflat. However, along the belts, regardless of vegetation, the SOC and TN stocks was higher in the northern transect than in the middle and southern transects. Vertically the stocks distributed in the soil profiles in similar patterns in all areas. Generally SOC stock peaked in the >10-15 cm soil layer in the mudflat and S. mariqueter marsh, and in the surface soil layer(0-10 cm soil layer) and the >20-30 cm soil layer in the P. australis marsh and S. alterniflora marsh. The vertical distribution of TN stock was quite similar to that of SOC stock, showing an extremely significant positive correlation (P<0.01). All the findings in this study suggest that in the study area the type of the vegetation in the salt marsh is the major factor affecting the SOC and TN stocks, while in the bare mudflat, tide and sedimentation are the major affecting factors.

TI  - Carbon stocks and accumulation rates in Red Sea seagrass meadows
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (C-org) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4 +/- 0.3 kg C-org m(-2) in 1 m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8 +/- 1.7 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low C-org storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil C-org storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil C-org pool, fluxes of C-org from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store C-org in coastal areas.

TI  - Characterization of the salt marsh soils and visible-near-infrared spectroscopy along a chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora invasion in a coastal wetland of eastern China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction of exotic Spartina alterniflora (S. alternifiora) is important to re-establish the structure and function of salt marsh ecosystems along the coast of China. Characterization the spatial-temporal patterns of S. alternifiora soils is thus essential for the assessment of the pace of ecosystem development. However, the determination of soil properties by traditional analysis almost impossible achieve a timely detection of soil changes that is generally required by soil monitoring tasks for demonstrating impacts of S. alternifiora invasion. This work focused on the use of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) for characterizing soils and predicting key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alterniflora areas. A set of soil profiles representing a chronosequence of S. alternifiora invasion was used, comprising 45 samples from 15 sites. The results showed that approximately 20-year of S. alterniflora invasion has altered soil characteristics especially in the topsoil. Changes of soil associated with sampling horizons and ages of S. alternifiora could be distinguishable using soil variables and VNIRS, and high correlations were found between soils and spectra information. The results of predictions showed that predictive accuracy for salinity, pH, clay, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, organic carbon and calcium carbonate were acceptable, but models for total nitrogen, bulk density, sand and silt were less satisfactory. These results suggested the possibility of VNIRS for the rapid assessment of key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alternifiora areas. This work highlights that VNIRS technique could be taken as a useful tool to investigate soil changes and explore understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.

TI  - Brackish marshes erode twice as fast as saline marshes in the Mississippi Delta region
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh soil properties vary drastically across estuarine salinity gradients, which can affect soil strength and, consequently, marsh edge erodibility. Here, we quantify how marsh erosion differs between saline and brackish marshes of the Mississippi Delta. We analyzed long-term (1932-2015) maps of marsh loss and developed an algorithm to distinguish edge erosion from interior loss. We found that the edge erosion rate remains nearly constant at decadal timescales, whereas interior loss varies by more than 100%. On average, roughly half of marsh loss can be attributed to edge erosion, the other half to interior loss. Based on data from 42 cores, brackish marsh soils had a lower bulk density (0.17 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3)), a higher organic content (43% vs. 26%), a lower shear strength (2.0 vs. 2.5 kPa), and a lower shear strength in the root layer (13.8 vs. 20.7 kPa) than saline marsh soils. We then modified an existing marsh edge erosion model by including a salinity-dependent erodibility. By calibrating the erodibility with the observed retreat rates, we found that the brackish marsh is two to three times more erodible than the saline marshes. Overall, this model advances the ability to simulate estuarine systems as a whole, thus transcending the salinity boundaries often used in compartmentalized marsh models.

TI  - Flooding Alters Plant-Mediated Carbon Cycling Independently of Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant-mediated processes determine carbon (C) cycling and storage in many ecosystems; how plant-associated processes may be altered by climate-induced changes in environmental drivers is therefore an essential question for understanding global C cycling. In this study, we hypothesize that environmental alterations associated with near-term climate change can exert strong control on plant-associated ecosystem C cycling and that investigations along an extended hydrologic gradient may give mechanistic insight into C cycling. We utilize a mesocosm approach to investigate the response of plant, soil, and gaseous C cycling to changing hydrologic regimes and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations expected by 2100 in a coastal salt marsh in Louisiana, USA. Although elevated CO2 had no significant effects on C cycling, we demonstrate that greater average flooding depth stimulated C exchange, with higher rates of labile C decomposition, plant CO2 assimilation, and soil C respiration. Greater average flooding depth also significantly decreased the soil C pool and marginally increased the aboveground biomass C pool, leading to net losses in total C stocks. Further, flooding depths along an extended hydrologic gradient garnered insight into decomposition mechanisms that was not apparent from other data. In C-4 dominated salt marshes, sea level rise will likely overwhelm effects of elevated CO2 with climate change. Deeper flooding associated with sea level rise may decrease long-term soil C pools and quicken C exchange between soil and atmosphere, thereby threatening net C storage in salt marsh habitats. Manipulative studies will be indispensable for understanding biogeochemical cycling under future conditions.Plain Language Summary This study examines how near-term climate change may affect the exchange and storage of carbon by plants in salt marshes. Our results indicate that sea level rise will increase the amount of carbon that is moved from the soil into the atmosphere, shrinking the amount of carbon in salt marsh soil. This may reduce the ability of salt marshes to keep carbon in soil long term and decrease the ability of salt marshes to offset climate change. As salt marshes are some of the best ecosystems on the planet for storing carbon in soils, any change in how these ecosystems process carbon is important to understand.

TI  - Seasonal variation of inorganic nitrogen and net mineralization in a salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - Mangroves and Salt Marshes
M3  - Article
AB  - Inorganic nitrogen pools and net mineralization were estimated in three sites of a Tagus estuary salt marsh in Portugal throughout 1 year. Ammonium (NH4+) was the major form of inorganic nitrogen found in the salt marsh soil. Extractable NH4+ concentrations showed a marked seasonal pattern with a concentration peak during the hotter months of July/August. The great majority (> 99%) of the total nitrogen in the soil was found in sedimented organic matter, not readily available for plant uptake. Net nitrogen mineralization, determined using a field incubation method, showed a peak during the months of June/July which resulted in an increase on nitrogen availability. With the exception of the lower salt marsh, estimated rates of in situ net nitrogen mineralization in the soil during summer were well related to the increase in plant above-ground biomass and plant nitrogen pools, indicating that the process is an important source of available nitrogen for plant uptake andgrowth. Annual net nitrogen mineralization ranged between 2.4 and 4.5 g N m-2 yr-1 being significantly higher for the lower salt marsh site. Rates of net nitrogen mineralization were relatively low during most of the year with a particularly active period from June to August, possibly due to an effect of temperature on soil microbial activity.

TI  - Tidal marsh biomass field plot and remote sensing datasets for six regions in the conterminous United States (ver. 2.0, June 2020)
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). To meet this objective we developed the first national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. We tested how plant community composition and vegetation structure differences across estuaries influence model development, and whether data from multiple sensors, in particular Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar and Landsat, can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n=409, RMSE=464 g/m2, 12.2% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass and carbon for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model error was reduced by scaling field measured biomass by Landsat fraction green vegetation derived from object-based classification of National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery. We generated 30m resolution biomass maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map for each region. With a mean plant %C of 44.1% (n=1384, 95% C.I.=43.99% - 44.37%) we estimated mean aboveground carbon densities (Mg/ha) and total carbon stocks for each wetland type for each region. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon estimates that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen input on carbon cycle and carbon budget in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are an effective blue carbon sink to mitigate climate warming, but their ecosystem stability and carbon sink function are threatened by the large amount of nitrogen input caused by coastal eutrophication. Under the action of regular tides, the high nitrogen content in the coastal waters will have a profound effect on the key processes of carbon cycle such as plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, and soil carbon release in the salt marsh. This study reviewed the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, decomposition of soil organic carbon, formation and release of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Based on the shortcomings of current research, this review proposed the directions of future research, including the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation and carbon allocation in plant-soil system, the microbial mechanism of soil organic carbon decomposition, production and lateral exchange of soil DOC, and the potential impact of different forms of nitrogen input on soil carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Overall, this study aims to improve the understanding of impacts of nitrogen input on the key carbon processes and the mechanisms of carbon sequestration in a salt marsh, and to provide new ideas for assessing the potential changes of carbon pools under the influence of eutrophication of coastal waters in the salt marsh wetlands.

TI  - Metrics for Evaluating Inundation Impacts on the Decomposer Communities in a Southern California Coastal Salt Marsh
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern California coastal wetlands are heavily impacted by urbanization and are under increased inundation stress due to sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the impacts of inundation on decomposition rates and sediment decomposer communities (invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria) by manipulating inundation using a marsh organ. Under increased inundation, invertebrate diversity decreased, and plant litter decomposition was reduced by excluding fungi and invertebrates from substrates using litter bags, indicating that all three decomposer guilds are important. This study showed significant impacts of increased inundation on bacterial, fungal and invertebrate community structure and diversity, yet only modest effects on sulfate reduction and decomposition rates, suggesting a degree of resilience or functional redundancy in the decomposer community. While the marsh organ successfully simulated increased inundation, it also created experimental 'bottle effects' that may have obscured inundation treatment effects and altered communities from the natural marsh. In our study, invertebrates were most sensitive to inundation, while bacteria appeared to be more resistant. This has implications for how decomposition and associated biogeochemical and ecological processes might change in the face of increased inundation due to SLR and suggests that marsh organs may be less suitable for investigating microbial communities compared with plants.

TI  - Golden carbon of Sargassum forests revealed as an opportunity for climate change mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine climate change mitigation initiatives have recently attracted a great deal of interest in the role of natural carbon sinks, particularly on coastal systems. Brown seaweeds of the genus Sargassum are the largest canopyforming algae in tropical and subtropical environments, with a wide global distribution on rocky reefs and as floating stands. Because these algae present high amounts of biomass, we suggest their contribution is relevant for global carbon stocks and consequently formitigating climate change as CO2 remover. Wemodelled global distributions and quantified carbon stocks as above-ground biomass (AGB) with machine learning algorithms and climate data. Sargassum AGB totaled 13.1 Pg C at the global scale, which is a significant amount of carbon, comparable to other key marine ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows. However, specific techniques related to bloom production and management, or the utilization of biomass for biomaterials, should be fostered. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fusion of lidar and multispectral data to quantify salt marsh carbon stocks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbaceous salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. Unfortunately, quantification of the above-ground portion of biomass using passive optical remote sensing is constrained by the complexities of mixed spectral appearance in the water land environment. Lidar remote sensing, on the other hand, has been extensively used to estimate forest biomass, and a few studies have reported their use in characterizing short or herbaceous plants. However, no empirical studies have demonstrated the combined use of lidar and spectral data to quantify above-ground biomass in herbaceous environments, including salt marshes. Thus, the findings of this study will contribute substantially to the understanding of potentials and limitations of using lidar and multi-spectral data for vegetation characterization and biomass estimates in salt marshes and other similar herbaceous environments. In this study, we evaluate the increased capability of a data fusion approach using small footprint discrete return lidar and multispectral data to quantify above-ground biomass and thus, carbon stocks in salt marshes. The specific objectives of our study were the following: 1) to understand the interaction between discrete-return airborne lidar and marsh vegetation; 2) to determine the appropriate grid size/s of lidar-derived datasets for characterizing marsh terrain and vegetation; 3) to investigate the applicability of a number of lidar metrics to predict salt marsh vegetation height and above-ground biomass; and 4) to evaluate the utility of integrating multispectral imagery with lidar to improve the predictability of regression models for quantifying above-ground biomass and carbon. Our results showed that salt marsh Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived using local minima in a grid spacing of 5 m x 5 m provided the best accuracy in terrain elevation estimates with an RMSE of less than 10 cm. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation heights (Lmax) provided the best agreement with field height measurements, but explained only 41% of the variance in vegetation height measurements (RMSE = 5.85 cm). Regardless of the metrics used, lidar-measured heights underestimated the field vegetation height, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in short or herbaceous vegetation. The fusion of lidar with multispectral data improved model predictions of live, dead, and total biomass quantities. The improvement provided by the fusion over the use of lidar or multispectral data alone was marginal; the combination explained 47% of the variance, whereas the best models using lidar and multispectral data separately explained 37% and 28% of variances in live biomass measurements, respectively. However, the best biomass prediction models reported considerably low RMSEs and % root square errors (%RSEs). For example, %RSE for the biomass prediction model using lidar-derived maximum vegetation height (Lmax) was closer to 20%, which is the recommended error threshold for remote sensing based forest biomass prediction models that can be repeatedly applicable for estimating forest carbon stock change. Our findings also demonstrate that lidar as compared to spectral data can provide better estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon, even in the herbaceous and low-relief context of a salt marsh.

TI  - Experimental sediment addition in salt-marsh management: Plant-soil carbon dynamics in southern New England
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin Layer Placement (TLP) is an increasingly used management technique to promote coastal resilience to accelerated sea level rise, but it is unclear how differential thickness of dredged sediment application alters plantsoil carbon dynamics in northeastern Atlantic coast salt marshes. We initiated a field experiment in a microtidal Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) dominated salt marsh in Connecticut (USA) to examine how a silt-loam dredge applied at different thicknesses (low: +5 cm, medium: +10 cm, and high: +15 cm) altered biological and biogeochemical responses. Over two growing seasons we monitored plant responses (above and belowground biomass, stem height, stem density, leaf area) and soil-biogeochemical parameters (EC, pH, redox, NH4+, sulfides, C:N, decomposition, bulk density, carbon fluxes). We found adding 5-7 cm of dredged sediment promoted rapid revegetation, alleviated phytotoxic sulfides, enhanced CO2 uptake, and reduced CH4 emissions. Low treatments reached similar vegetation cover to controls after one growing season, though sediment treatments greater than 10-cm thick showed delayed growth. Low levels of sediment addition stimulated the highest root biomass in the underlying soil, promoting CO2 efflux, but this was offset by aboveground biomass productivity, promoting net CO2 uptake. Phytotoxic sulfides were reduced in all sediment addition treatments, but our data indicate that coastal managers aiming to promote rapid vegetative recovery while increasing elevation in the short term should target conservative depths (< 10 cm) when using fine-grained dredged material. Collectively, our work will guide wetland managers as they develop restoration specifications for perpetuating coastal marshes in the face of rising seas.

TI  - Environmental Controls on the Distribution of Tidal Wetland Soil Organic Carbon in the Continental United States
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world in terms of ecosystem service value, and the strategic management of their carbon resources is an important part of climate change mitigation. Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained similar to 46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors. This synthetic work can provide a better understanding of how changing environmental and social conditions can lead to enhanced or degraded carbon sequestration rates in times of rapid global change.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological range of the halophilous plants were studied in the salt marsh of Txipio (Butroi river) in northern Spain, with respect to some of the most influential edaphic parameters (moisture, conductivity, pH, organic matter) of the environment. This area has been undergoing a natural regeneration since 1965, when tide broke the water retaining walls and agricultural activities were stopped at the site. Thirteen plant species occurred and the most abundant ones were analysed according to different edaphic parameters. Conductivity was the primary factor explaining the distribution of halophilous plants. Texture was also a conditioning factor in species distribution in the marsh, while pH was not determinant, Despite the low regeneration time of the site, the species distribution and edaphic conditions showed a significant recovery of the area.

TI  - The soil physical and chemical properties of restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres, Louisiana
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Isles Dernieres is a transgressive barrier island arc in southeast Louisiana associated with the Bayou Grand Caillou headland of the Lafourche delta complex, which was abandoned 600 to 800 years ago. During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the goal is to identify the soil properties in restored marsh that could be modified to enhance back-barrier marsh habitat.Laboratory analyses of 60 cores from four different vegetation density classes in restored marsh and nine cores from natural marshes included bulk density, soil moisture content, grain size, sorting, pH, conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Vegetation density in restored marshes had no significant effect on soil properties, with the exception of bulk density. Marsh type had a significant effect on all measured soil properties. Variations in the soil properties of restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh are primarily the result of differences in soil texture and elevation.

TI  - Biophysical drivers of net ecosystem and methane exchange across phenological phases in a tidal salt marsh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are large carbon reservoirs as part of blue carbon ecosystems. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the net ecosystem (NEE) and methane (CH4) exchange between salt marshes and the atmosphere to fully understand their carbon dynamics. We tested the influence of biophysical drivers by plant phenological phases (i.e., Greenup, Maturity, Senescence and Dormancy) on NEE and CH4 exchange in a grass-dominated temperate tidal salt marsh. We used three years of data derived from eddy covariance, PhenoCam (to measure vegetation phenology), and ancillary meteorological and water/soil variables. Overall, NEE showed significant differences among all phenological phases (p < 0.05), while CH4 exchange had significant differences among all phases except for Greenup and Dormancy. Net CO2 uptake was higher across Maturity (-61 g C-CO2 m(2)), while CO2 emissions were higher during Dormancy (182 g C-CO2 m(2)). The lower but constant CO2 emissions during Dormancy overshadowed the CO2 uptake during the growing season and contributed to >72% of the annual CO2 emissions in this ecosystem. Net CH4 emissions were higher during Maturity (3.7 g C-CH4 m(2)) and Senescence (4.2 g C-CH4 m(2)). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) substantially influenced (r(2) > 0.57) daytime NEE across phenological phases, but a combination of variables including water table level (WTL), water temperature and atmospheric pressure were relevant to explain CH4 exchange. The study site was an overall net carbon source to the atmosphere with annual emissions of 13-201 g C-CO2 m(-2)yr(-1) and 8.5-15.2 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Our findings provide insights on: a) the role of plant phenological phases on ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes; b) challenges for modeling ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in salt marshes; and c) the potential net loss of carbon to the atmosphere that should be considered for carbon management and accounting in these ecosystems.

TI  - Analysizing and quantitatively evaluating the organic matter source at different ecologic zones of tidal salt marsh, North Jiangsu Province
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The indicators including TOC, TN, C/N, delta C-13 and delta N-15 of surface sediments, core sediments and plants of tidal salt marshes in North Jiangsu Province are analysized. Subsequently, distribution regularities of these measurement indicators are discussed, and the biogeochemistry processes between sediments and plants are also analysized. Lastly, the organic matter sources of different ecologic zones in tidal salt marsh are evaluated, and the organic matter accumulations in different ecologic zones induced by their plants are also compared. The results indicate that TOC, TN, C/N and a 13C show obviously zonal distribution. The organic matter sources are dominated by marine input in silt flat, Artemisia schrenkiana flat, and the transition zone between silt and Spartina alterniflora flat, and controlled by terrigenous input in Spartina alterniflora flat. Spartina alterniflora plays an important role in the accumulation of organic matter in the whole tidal salt marshes ecosystem. In study area, the annually increased TOC, organic matter and TN in Spartina alterniflora flat, Artemisia schrenkiana flat and reed flat respectively reach 6 451t, 16 595t and 536t. The amount of TOC, organic matter and TN accumulated in Spartina alterniflora flat are more than those in other ecological zones, which show that the Spartina alterniflora flat exert nonreplaceable effect on the material cycle and exchange in the whole tidal salt marshes ecosystem.

TI  - Effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CH4 emissions from the stands of Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been estimated that solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the Earth's surface will continue increasing until 2050s. To investigate the effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CH4 emission from the coastal marsh, mesocosm experiments were conducted to monitor CH4 emissions in stands of invasive plant Spartina alterniflora and native plant Phragmites australis from a coastal salt marsh exposed to ambient and elevated UV-B radiation, respectively. Enhanced UV-B radiation dramatically decreased aboveground, belowground biomass and plant height of P. australis by 16%, 24% and 16%, respectively, and did not affect those of S. alterniflora. This suggests that P. australis was much more sensitive to elevated UV-B than S. alterniflora. The seasonal variation patterns of CH4 fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis mesocosms were very similar, and were hardly affected by exposure to elevated UV-B. Mean CH4 emission rates were higher in S. alterniflora than P. australis mesocosms under both ambient and enhanced UV-B radiation due to the higher biomass of S. alterniflora, which could fix and allocate more photosynthetic carbon to the soil. Seasonal average CH4 flux from the P. australis mesocosms under elevated UV-B radiation was 0.51 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which was 25% lower than the value under ambient radiation. In contrast, there was no notable effect of elevated UV-B on CH4 emission from the S. alterniflora mesocosms. Enhanced UV-B remarkably decreased porewater DOC and CH4 concentrations by 17% and 23%, respectively, in the P. australis mesocosms during the growing season. This indicates that CH4 emission from the P. australis mesocosms under elevated UV-B was primarily reduced by the reduction of porewater CH4 concentration due to the decrease in plant biomass. Thus, our results suggest that CH4 fluxes in the coastal marshes would be increased by the invasion of S. alterniflora, and the effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CH4 emission from the coastal salt marsh is strongly correlated with plant characteristics.

TI  - Natural and Regenerated Saltmarshes Exhibit Similar Soil and Belowground Organic Carbon Stocks, Root Production and Soil Respiration
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes provide many valuable ecosystem services including storage of a large amount of 'blue carbon' within their soils. To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for 'blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Above- and Belowground Biomass Allocation in Four Dominant Salt Marsh Species of the Eastern United States
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of aboveground and belowground biomass allocations are important for characterization of structure and function in marsh ecosystems as various processes such as carbon sequestration, gas transport, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience are affected by these allocations. We measured aboveground and belowground biomass, root and rhizome characteristics, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of various tissues of four tidal marsh species in New Jersey by harvesting biomass during peak growing season. The aboveground biomasses for Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Distichlis spicata were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7 and 1.2 kg m(-2), respectively. The ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass for S. alterniflora and D. spicata, harvested from a recently restored wetland were lower than in previous studies. LAI for S. alterniflora, D. spicata, P. australis, and S. patens were 8.4, 6.8, 4.8 and 3.7 m(2) m(-2), respectively. Diameter of rhizome and root, number of primary roots per node, root surface area to volume ratio, and C/N of various tissues varied with species. The measured above- and belowground biometric traits are crucial for a better understanding of carbon dynamics, and modeling greenhouse gas transport in marsh ecosystems.

TI  - A remote sensing-based model of tidal marsh aboveground carbon stocks for the conterminous United States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a mean plant carbon content of 44.1% (n = 1384, 95% C.I. = 43.99%-44.37%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822 Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent as well.

TI  - Origin of organic carbon in the topsoil of Wadden Sea salt marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including salt marshes, play an important role in the global carbon cycle because of their high-efficiency storage of organic carbon (OC) in soils. Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock. These findings thereby yield important implications for carbon crediting and land-use management.

TI  - Reclamation of coastal salt marshes promoted carbon loss from previously-sequestered soil carbon pool
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of 'blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

TI  - Effects of Water Level and Salinity on Total Sulfur Contents in Salt Marsh Soils of the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A field experiment was conducted on three different water levels and four salinity levels to investigate the effects of water level and salinity on the total sulfur (TS) content of marsh soil in the Yellow River Delta of China. The total sulfur content of surface and subsurface soils from incubated soil cores were measured under different water and salinity levels on three sampling dates. Our results showed that a higher TS content appeared in surface soils under a 5 cm water level on different sampling dates, of which higher TS content was observed in August (916 mg/kg) and October (1,335 mg/kg) under a 16.7aEuro degrees salinity level. However, a higher TS level (1,167 mg/kg) was observed under a 0.52aEuro degrees salinity level in September. Meanwhile, a lower TS content appeared in subsurface soils under a 10 cm water level at a 10.2aEuro degrees salinity level. The interaction of the water level and salinity had a significant effect on both the TS content and the C/S ratio. The TS content was significantly correlated with soil organic matter. However, a significant correlation between the total sulfur and the C/N ratio was not observed.

TI  - Freshwater diversions as an ecosystem management tool for maintaining soil organic matter accretion in coastal marshes
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh soil accretion processes were examined at 12 locations in fresh and brackish marshes in Louisiana's northern Barataria Basin estuary. Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Microbial mechanism for enhanced methane emission in deep soil layer of Phragmites-introduced tidal marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of Phragmites australis is known to substantially increase methane emission in the tidal salt marsh. Previous studies suggested that enhanced carbon input by the introduction may stimulate methanogenic activity. However, the exact mechanisms and the effects of the introduction of P. australis to methane dynamics in the deep soil layer are still unclear. In this study we collected 1 m deep intact soil cores and gas samples at native Suaeda japonica- and P. australis-vegetated temperate tidal salt marshes in Suncheon Bay, Republic of Korea. Rates of methane emission and vertical distribution of soil biogeochemistry and microbial communities were analyzed to understand the relationship among chemical and microbiological properties. The introduction of P. australis significantly enhanced methane emission in sites, which was caused by increased DOC and reduced competitive inhibition between sulfate reducer and methanogens. In particular, reduced competitive inhibition between sulfate reducers and methanogens in deep soil layer may play a substantial role in the enhanced methane emission by the introduction of P. australis. Potential methane production was also significantly higher in deeper soil layers than the surface soil layer. We suggest that deep soil layer plays a critical role in the methane dynamics of tidal salt marsh which is introduced by deep root plants, such as P. australis.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes of an urban tidal marsh in the Hudson-Raritan estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of tidal brackish wetlands in urban areas is largely unknown, albeit it is an important ecosystem service. High carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake of estuaries can potentially be achieved by creating conditions that foster CO2 uptake and sequestration. Thus, this study sought to assess NEE in a mesohaline tidal urban wetland that has been restored and determine the biophysical drivers of NEE in order to investigate uptake strength and drivers thereof. Beginning in 2009, NEE was measured using the eddy covariance technique in a restored urban estuarine wetland. Maximum NEE rates observed were -30 mu molm(-2)s(-1) under high light conditions in the summer. Monthly mean NEE showed this ecosystem to be a CO2 source in the winter, but a CO2 sink in summer. Conditional Granger causality showed the influence of net radiation on half daily to biweekly timescales on NEE and the influence of water level at half daily time scales. The overall productivity of this wetland is within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes and it was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in two out of the 3years of this study and had a continued increase over the study period.

AB  - Inter-tidal marshes are dynamic diverse ecosystems at the transition zone between terrestrial and ocean environments. Geomorphologically, inter-tidal salt marshes are vegetated landforms at elevations slightly greater than mean tidal levels that have distributed channels formed under ebb (drainage) tidal flows that widen and deepen in the seaward direction. The drainage channels enable tidal flows to circulate sediments and nutrients through the marsh system during normal tidal events, while depositing sediments during storm or seismic events. This dynamic system encourages considerable biodiversity while simultaneously providing water quality enhancement features that service marsh terrestrial life and marine life in the estuary. Reservoir creation limiting sediment transport, anticipated large increases in sea levels as well as agricultural and urban development have resulted in significant loss of inter-tidal marshes and subsequent adverse impacts on waterfowl, infauna and fisheries. The complex and continuously changing marsh channel hydraulics and sedimentary processes have severely constrained quantitative modeling of these marsh systems such that restoration/creation efforts remain something of an empirical science and further assessments are needed. The purpose of this paper is to outline current understanding of salt marsh hydrodynamics, sediment accretion processes and subsequent response of marsh vegetation to set the stage for assessment of a marsh restoration effort along San Pablo Bay near San Francisco, California. Several kilometers of drainage channels were constructed in a 624 ha disturbed salt marsh to restore tidal circulation and vegetation so as to enhance habitat for threatened species (e.g. clapper rail, harvest mouse, delta smelt and potentially anadromous fish species). Two distinct drainage channel systems ('east' and 'west') were installed having similar channel dimensions common to salt marshes in the region, but having design bankfull tidal prism volumes differing by a factor of two. Following channel excavation, main channel tidal flows and sediment loads as well as marsh sediment accretion rates were monitored to assess the relative success of the excavation in restoring tidal circulation and vegetation (Salicornia spp.) to the marsh. Annual aerial surveys corroborated with ground-truthing indicated that marsh vegetation rapidly expanded, from 40 to 85% coverage several years following excavation. The 'east' channel intake was nearly completely silted in within three years. However, channel surveys and flow measurements indicated that the 'east' channel system tidal prism was only about 1200 m(3), more than an order of magnitude less than that of the stable 'west' channel system. Marsh sediment accretion rates were on the order of 7-8 mm yr(-1), a rate common to the Pacific coast region that exceeds estimated sea level rise rates of similar to2 mm yr(-1). East channel network siltation resulted in storm and spring tidal flood ponding such that marsh vegetation coverage decreased to 51% of the marsh area and related habitat expansion decreased. These results are considered in terms of the primary inter-tidal marsh factors affecting possible restoration/creation strategies.

TI  - The Importance of Marine Predators in the Provisioning of Ecosystem Services by Coastal Plant Communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Food web theory predicts that current global declines in marine predators could generate unwanted consequences for many marine ecosystems. In coastal plant communities (kelp, seagrass, mangroves, and salt marsh), several studies have documented the far-reaching effects of changing predator populations. Across coastal ecosystems, the loss of marine predators appears to negatively affect coastal plant communities and the ecosystem services they provide. Here, we discuss some of the documented and suspected effects of predators on coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and the stability and resilience of coastal plant communities. In addition, we present a meta-analysis to assess the strength and direction of trophic cascades in kelp forests, seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves. We demonstrate that the strength and direction of trophic cascades varied across ecosystem types, with predators having a large positive effect on plants in salt marshes, a moderate positive effect on plants in kelp and mangroves, and no effect on plants in seagrasses. Our analysis also identified that there is a paucity of literature on trophic cascades for all four coastal plant systems, but especially seagrass and mangroves. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of predators in maintaining coastal ecosystem services, but also highlights the need for further research before large-scale generalizations about the prevalence, direction, and strength of trophic cascade in coastal plant communities can be made.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of anaerobic CO2 production in soils of Phragmites australis marshes with distinct hydrological characteristics in the Yellow River estuary
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) is important to reveal carbon decomposition responding to climate change. It's remains limited to understand how Q(10) of anaerobic soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is regulated by soil property in various wetlands with distinct hydrological characteristics. In the present study, samples of soil at the depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm were collected in three typical Phragmites australis marshes, including a freshwater marsh (FPa), a no-tidal salt marsh (NTPa) and a tidal salt marsh (TPa), in the Yellow River estuary. The soil samples were incubated at 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively, to determine the rates of anaerobic CO2 production, Q(10) values, and their relations to soil properties. Over 70-d incubation, temperature rise significantly increased the mean rates by 70%-136% (from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C) and 64%-142% (from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) among the marshes, with the mean Q(10) values ranging from 1.61 to 2.66. The rates of CO2 production and Q(10) values were significantly affected by wetland type and soil depth. Among marshes, the Q(10) of the FPa and NTPa soils was higher than that of the TPa soil (for 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm but for 20-30 cm); along soil depths, the Q(10) of the top soil was higher than that of the subsoil (for FPa and NTPa but for TPa). Q(10) was affected by total organic carbon (TOC), salinity and pH, and the effects were different with marshes. TOC was a main factor regulating Q(10) for the freshwater and the no-tidal salt marshes, while salinity and pH were main factors for the tidal salt marsh. The findings highlight an interactive mechanism of soil property and tidal underlying the response of SOM decomposition to temperature change in estuarine wetlands.

TI  - Effects of transient Phragmites australis removal on brackish marsh greenhouse gas fluxes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis is a common invasive reed of North American coastal marshes, and efforts to control or eradicate it often are included in coastal marsh restoration efforts. While much research has tested impacts of P. australis removal on plant and faunal communities, less is known about biogeochemical responses to P. australis removal. Since coastal marshes are valued for their robust carbon sequestration, understanding the effect of P. australis removal on marsh carbon cycling dynamics is important. Temporary P. australis aboveground biomass clearing conducted as part of a restoration effort provided an opportunity to evaluate changes in fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during P. australis removal and recovery. In Experiment 1 (2014 growing season), GHG fluxes were compared between a P. australis stand cleared mechanically and recovered within months of initial removal and an uncleared stand in the same marsh system. CO2 uptake increased dramatically in the cleared stand as P. australis regrew, but CH4 emissions remained unchanged, demonstrating that P. australis did not directly contribute to CH4 emission. In Experiment 2 (2015 manipulations), to test mechanisms of P. australis' impact on GHG fluxes, fluxes (light and dark) were compared between unimpacted P. australis plots, cut P. australis plots with litter, and cleared P. australis plots without litter. P. australis cutting (independent of litter removal) resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Recovery of P. australis directly drove the rapid recovery of CO2 uptake, and did not increase (and possibly attenuated) CH4 emissions. Results of this study suggest that at this site, P. australis removal, in the absence of native vegetation recovery, may exacerbate GHG emission of coastal marshes in the short term, and that longer-term impacts warrant investigation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of geochemical controls on carbon cycling in a tidal salt marsh
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marsh ecosystems store copious amounts of carbon (C) within sediments. In order to predict how these C stores may be affected by environmental change, it is critical to assess current CO 2 and CH 4 production and efflux from these ecosys- tems. Production and efflux of these greenhouse gases (GHGs) are governed by coupled geochemical, hydrological, physical and biological processes in sediments that are sensitive to local conditions, which can result in large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of GHGs dynamics within the ecosystem. To understand how the drivers of GHGs dynamics vary across salt marsh ecosystems, we coupled solid-phase geochemistry to measurements of porewater chemistry (to-1 m), CO2 and CH4 production in sediments and efflux to the atmosphere in a temperate tidal salt marsh for over one year to capture seasonal patterns within two vegetation zones of the marsh landscape that have distinct biogeochemical and hydrologic conditions: Tall Spartina (TS) and Short Spartina (SS). The SS vegetation zone experienced nearly constant inundation, low redox values (-200 to 200 mV), porewater pH 6-7 that did not vary with depth or time, an enrichment of pyrite and goethite with depth and up to 3 mM porewater sulfide. In contrast, the TS vegetation zone on the natural levee proximal to a tidal channel expe- rienced large water level oscillations due to spring-neap tides that resulted in variable but higher redox values (0-700 mV), porewater pH 6-7 at depth but surface (0-3 cm) as low as 4 in the spring, an enrichment of ferrihydrite and a depletion of pyrite at-30 cm, and up to 0.8 mM ferrous Fe in porewater. At 50-56 cm, solid phase analyses (STXM-NEXAFS) revealed differential C speciation between the two vegetation zones, with stronger C-Fe spatial association at TS and stronger C-Ca co- association at SS despite both having similar soil pH of 3-4. These results suggest that soil pH may not be strongly predictive of C-mineral control in flooded marsh sediments. Both vegetation zones showed consistent CO2 and CH4 emissions from sed- iments to the atmosphere throughout the study period with TS having-60% higher median CO 2 and SS having-55% higher median CH 4 efflux. Using depth profiling, unexpectedly high concentrations of CO 2 (>200 lM) and CH 4 (>200 lM) were observed at depths 50-75 cm at both zones that were higher for SS in these sulfate-rich (up to 17 mM) sediments, which sug- gests methylotrophic methanogenesis occurs deep within the profile of salt marsh sediments away from the tidal channel. Moreover, if we extrapolate our median depth values of CH 4 and CO 2 to the 5.3 Mha of global salt marshes, this could account for a conservative estimate of-70 Gg of unaccounted C stored in gaseous form (i.e., CH 4 and CO 2 ) in marsh sed- iments, which should be considered when attempting to understand the current patterns and future responses of carbon dynamics from these ecosystems.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal 'Blue Carbon' Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53% in tidal marshes, 36% in seagrasses, and 11% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over $AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of $AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90% remineralization of stocks), 98% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - Shifts of soil microbial community composition along a short-term invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora in a Chinese estuary
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic plant invasion can alter native soil microbial community composition, and further influence the biogeochemical processes. Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration and Nutrient (Nitrogen, Phosphorus) Accumulation in River-Dominated Tidal Marshes, Georgia, USA
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic C, N, and P were measured in salt, brackish, and tidal freshwater marshes in river-dominated estuaries (Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla) of the Georgia coast to evaluate the effects of salinity on C, N, and P storage and accumulation. Tidal freshwater marshes had greater concentrations of organic C (10.81% w/w) and N (0.71% w/w) than brackish (7.71% C, 0.50% N) or salt (5.95% C, 0.35% N) marshes. Soil accretion rates of Cs-137 were greater in tidal freshwater (4.78 mm yr(-1)) and brackish marshes (4.41 mm yr(-1)) than in salt marshes (1.91 mm yr(-1)). Consequently, organic C and N accumulation was greater in tidal freshwater (124 and 8.2 g m-(2) yr(-1)) and brackish (93 and 6.5 g m(-2) yr(-1)) marshes than salt marshes (40 and 2.4 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Phosphorus accumulation was greater in the brackish marshes. Lower salinity tidal freshwater and brackish marshes remove more C, N, and P; however, salt marshes dominate the spatial extent of the study area (60%) vs. brackish (33%) and tidal freshwater marshes (7%). Combining measurements of C, N, and P accumulation with tidal marsh area, we estimated that tidal freshwater, brackish, and salt marshes stored or removed the equivalent of 2 to 20% of watershed N inputs entering the estuaries from the terrestrial landscape. After accounting for N, fixation and denitrification, tidal marshes collectively removed the equivalent of 13 to 32% of the N entering estuaries. Tidal marshes, especially tidal freshwater and brackish marshes, are important for improving water quality and decreasing the impacts of N eutrophication of estuarine ecosystems.

TI  - Ecosystem Services: Delivering Decision-Making for Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are one of the world's most economically valuable habitats; yet, they have experienced large and persistent declines globally. Increased knowledge of the ecosystem services delivered by marshes has become a powerful tool to conserve and restore them. But hesitancies regarding valuations and their application in decision-making remain. Here we draw on the literature and collective experience of participants in the "Concepts and controversies in tidal Marsh ecology revisited" workshop, November 2 and 3, 2019, Mobile, AL, to provide a concise snapshot of the current field of salt marsh ecosystem service valuation, discuss the possible risks in salt marsh valuation, and the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate them. We provide examples of the application of valuation in conservation-related decision-making, illustrating the growing operationalization of ecosystem services in incentivizing salt marsh conservation and restoration. Ecosystem service quantification and valuation is already playing an important role in decision-making by coastal risk managers, insurers, engineers, and policy makers. While there are legitimate criticisms of valuation techniques and remaining uncertainties in ecosystem service delivery that arise both through natural variability across space and time and through differing and shifting cultural values, our perspective is that the rise of big data, the development of valuation techniques, a growing understanding and application of environmental justice practices, and increasing interdisciplinarity to tackle these complex issues are paving the way for valuation to play a critical role in decision-making around salt marshes.

TI  - Changes in Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in a Native C-4 Plant-Dominated Tidal Marsh Following Spartina alterniflora Invasion
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion of an exotic C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora has been shown to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations in native C-3 plant-dominated coastal wetlands of China. However, little is known about the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC concentrations and fractions in tidal marshes dominated by native C-4 plants. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0-4 years (SA-4), 4-8 years (SA-8), and 8-12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10-50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C-4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities.

TI  - Greenhouse gas flux with reflooding of a drained salt marsh soil
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and bury more C per square meter annually than any other ecosystem. Reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Carbon credits can be generated and sold by restoring marshes, but only if C sequestration and net reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG) are reliably quantified. Restored marshes, however, may exhibit different patterns of GHG emissions than natural marshes and it is possible that they could temporarily become sources of N2O even in the usually N-limited estuarine environment. Research on short-term GHG flux following salt marsh restoration is limited to studies of two restored marshes which examined GHG flux more than six months after the return of tidal flooding. Here we report on a laboratory experiment in which soil cores collected from a drained agricultural marsh on the St. Lawrence Estuary were flooded with estuary water. Gas flux measurements immediately after flooding revealed small increases in N2O and CH4, but a large decline in CO(2 )yielding, from a climatic perspective, a net cooling effect over the observation period. In addition to restoring the land's capacity to sequester C once a marsh develops, returning tidal flooding thus appears to have the added benefit of stemming large ongoing C losses. With more than 400 km(2) of undeveloped dykeland, Eastern Canada is well positioned to restore large sections of marsh and contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Effects of eutrophication on salt marsh root and rhizome biomass accumulation
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The root:shoot ratio of grassland plants may be lower in high fertility sites than in low fertility sites as plants modify their root, rhizome and shoot morphologies (and masses) to suit prevailing nutrient availability. We conducted geographically diverse and regionally specific field sampling and measured above- and belowground plant biomasses in western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico salt marshes to determine whether there is a similar morphological response in Spartina alterniflora, the dominant salt marsh plant. Coastal nutrient addition/enrichment, which is widespread and ongoing, may lower root and rhizome biomass, belowground production and organic accumulation in this species. Higher soil respiration and a lower Eh (redox potential) are expected additional soil property changes. The addition of P, more than of N, seems to reduce root and rhizome biomass accumulation. The cumulative effects of increased nutrient loadings on salt marshes may be to decrease soil elevation and accelerate the conversion of emergent plant habitat to open water, particularly on the lower marsh. The recommendations for management practices intended to conserve coastal marshes include reducing nutrient loading to coastal zones, solving water quality problems with a multiple nutrient approach, and choosing monitoring metrics that are based on both above- and belowground plant biomass.

TI  - Impacts of Age and Expansion Direction of Invasive Spartina alterniflora on Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in Coastal Salt Marshes Along Eastern China
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora has been reported to modify carbon (C) cycling processes and pools of the native salt marsh ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased. Our results showed that it is very important to assess the effects of invasion on SOC dynamics in salt marsh ecosystems by considering both the expansion direction and invasion age.

TI  - Millennial-Scale Carbon Storage in Natural Pine Forests of the North Carolina Lower Coastal Plain: Effects of Artificial Drainage in a Time of Rapid Sea Level Rise
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services along the southeastern region of the United States, but are threatened by anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Here, we examined the species composition, mortality, aboveground biomass, and carbon content of vegetation and soils in natural pine forests of the lower coastal plain in eastern North Carolina, USA. We compared a forest clearly in decline (termed "ghost forest") adjacent to a roadside canal that had been installed as drainage for a road next to an adjacent forest subject to "natural" hydrology, unaltered by human modification (termed "healthy forest"). We also assessed how soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation changed over time using C-14 radiocarbon dating of wood sampled at different depths within the peat profile. Our results showed that the ghost forest had a higher tree density at 687 trees ha(-1), and was dominated by swamp bays (Persea palustric), compared to the healthy forest, which had 265 trees ha(-1) dominated by pond pine (Pinus serotina Michx). Overstory tree mortality of the ghost forest was nearly ten times greater than the healthy forest (p < 0.05), which actually contributed to higher total aboveground biomass (55.9 +/- 12.6 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 27.9 +/- 8.7 Mg ha(-1) in healthy forest), as the dead standing tree biomass (snags) added to that of an encroaching woody shrub layer during ecosystem transition. Therefore, the total aboveground C content of the ghost forest, 33.98 +/- 14.8 Mg C ha(-1), was higher than the healthy forest, 24.7 +/- 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) (p < 0.05). The total SOC stock down to a 2.3 m depth in the ghost forest was 824.1 +/- 46.2 Mg C ha(-1), while that of the healthy forest was 749.0 +/- 170.5 Mg C ha(-1) (p > 0.05). Carbon dating of organic sediments indicated that, as the sample age approaches modern times (surface layer year 2015), the organic soil accumulation rate (1.11 to 1.13 mm year(-1)) is unable to keep pace with the estimated rate of recent sea level rise (2.1 to 2.4 mm year(-1)), suggesting a causative relationship with the ecosystem transition occurring at the site. Increasing hydrologic stress over recent decades appears to have been a major driver of ecosystem transition, that is, ghost forest formation and woody shrub encroachment, as indicated by the far higher overstory tree mortality adjacent to the drainage ditch, which allows the inland propagation of hydrologic/salinity forcing due to SLR and extreme storms. Our study documents C accumulation in a coastal wetland over the past two millennia, which is now threatened due to the recent increase in the rate of SLR exceeding the natural peat accumulation rate, causing an ecosystem transition with unknown consequences for the stored C; however, much of it will eventually be returned to the atmosphere. More studies are needed to determine the causes and consequences of coastal ecosystem transition to inform the modeling of future coastal wetland responses to environmental change and the estimation of regional terrestrial C stocks and flux.

TI  - Labile and Recalcitrant Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Pools in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Eastern Chinese Coast as Affected by Short-Term C-4 Plant Spartina alterniflora Invasion
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, affected by plant invasion, are not fully understood. In this study, the impact of 10 years Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic matter (SOM), labile, and recalcitrant pools was examined comparing with bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities in tidal salt marshes of the Eastern Chinese coast. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly raised C and N concentrations in SOM, labile and recalcitrant pools compared to bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils. Spartina alterniflora soil had higher recalcitrant index for C relative to bare flat. The proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C and the decomposition rate of old C in the labile pool were significantly higher than those in the recalcitrant pool. However, the S. alterniflora-derived C stock of the recalcitrant pool was much greater than that of the labile pool. The SOM and recalcitrant pools in S. alterniflora soil had significantly higher delta N-15 levels compared with bare flat, indicating an increased N loss following S. alterniflora invasion. The results suggested that short- term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enlarged soil organic C and N pools via altering SOM input and decomposition.

TI  - Losses of salt marsh in China: Trends, threats and management
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh, one of the blue carbon ecosystems that can adapt and mitigate climate change influence, is drawing global attention due to its high carbon sequestration capability. In China, however, coastal salt marsh has suffered great losses. Nation-wide analysis of salt marsh trends and management is critical to ecosystem protection and restoration. Thus, by analyzing previous coastal salt marsh studies, we found that the extent of coastal salt marsh varied greatly among the Liao River Delta, the Yellow River Delta, the middle coast of Jiangsu Province, Chongming Dongtan and Jiuduansha in Shanghai, with a 59% overall loss of salt marsh extent from the 1980s to the 2010s. The rate of salt marsh loss slowed down after the year 2000. Coastal land-claim (reclamation) is the most dominant driver of salt marsh loss. Climate change and coastal erosion, invasive species, and vegetation dynamics driven by competition and succession have also led to various effects on salt marsh extent and the ecological services they provide. Sea level rise, reclamation pressure and environmental pollution are the main factors, as negative drivers, together with conservation and restoration policies, as positive ones, affecting future trends in salt marshes. China has implemented several measures to protect and restore salt marshes, such as setting up protected areas, drawing marine ecological redline, and making strict regulations on reclamation. However, stronger legal protection for wetlands, more effective enforcement, and participation by local communities can further enhance salt marsh restoration, conservation and management.

TI  - Marsh vertical accretion via vegetative growth
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes accrete vertically in response to sea-level rise and subsidence. Inadequate accretion and subsequent conversion of coastal marshes to open water generally is attributed to inadequate mineral sedimentation because mineral sedimentation is widely assumed to control accretion. Using Cs-137 dating to determine vertical accretion, mineral sedimentation, and organic matter accumulation, we found that accretion varied with organic accumulation rather than mineral sedimentation across a wide range of conditions in coastal Louisiana, including stable marshes where soil was 80% mineral matter. These results agreed with previous research, but no mechanism had been proposed to explain accretion via vegetative growth. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we found that flooding stimulated root growth above the marsh surface. These results indicated the need for additional work to determine if flooding controls accretion in some marshes by stimulating root growth on the marsh surface, rather than by mineral accumulation on the marsh surface. Restoration or management that focus on mineral sedimentation may be ineffective where a relationship between accretion and mineral sedimentation is assumed rather than tested. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of reclamation and regeneration processes on organic matter from estuarine soils and sediments
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three adjacent areas in the Urdaibai Estuary (NW Spain) comprising a reclaimed salt marsh, a natural salt marsh and a regenerated salt marsh were sampled in order to study edaphic processes and changes in organic matter (OM) composition related to reclamation and regeneration of soils and sediments in estuarine environments. For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions and a lack of tidal influence, transformation of the former salt marsh to grassland resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were similar to those of the natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - Soil Biology and Biochemistry
M3  - Article
AB  - Denitrification was studied using samples of salt marsh soils collected from the New Jersey [USA] coast. The pH, organic matter content, NO3- and NO2- concentrations were determined on samples from marshes with and without grasses. Denitrification was measured in laboratory studies over a temperature range of 4-60.degree. C and a pH range of 5.0-9.0 by monitoring NO3- reduction, NO2- reduction and N2 evolution. Optimum conditions were controlled by a temperature-pH interaction which caused shifts in the pH optima relative to the change in temperature. NO3- and NO2- were reduced over a broad range of NO3- concentrations; 0.2 mg NO2--N ml-1 completely inhibited denitrification. The presence of NO3- reverses this inhibition. N2O was produced only at low pH values and low NO3- concentrations. The NO2- reducing system was the most easily disrupted of the 3 main processes of denitrification.

TI  - Environmental Controls, Emergent Scaling, and Predictions of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Fluxes in Coastal Salt Marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes play an important role in mitigating global warming by removing atmospheric carbon at a high rate. We investigated the environmental controls and emergent scaling of major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in coastal salt marshes by conducting data analytics and empirical modeling. The underlying hypothesis is that the salt marsh GHG fluxes follow emergent scaling relationships with their environmental drivers, leading to parsimonious predictive models. CO2 and CH4 fluxes, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, well water level, soil moisture, and porewater pH and salinity were measured during May-October 2013 from four marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuaries, MA, USA. The salt marshes exhibited high CO2 uptake and low CH4 emission, which did not significantly vary with the nitrogen loading gradient -1 (5-126 kg.ha(-1).year ) among the salt marshes. Soil temperature was the strongest driver of both fluxes, representing 2 and 4-5 times higher influence than PAR and salinity, respectively. Well water level, soil moisture, and pH did not have a predictive control on the GHG fluxes, although both fluxes were significantly higher during high tides than low tides. The results were leveraged to develop emergent power law-based parsimonious scaling models to accurately predict the salt marsh GHG fluxes from PAR, soil temperature, and salinity (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency = 0.80-0.91). The scaling models are available as a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet named Coastal Wetland GHG Model to explore scenarios of GHG fluxes in tidal marshes under a changing climate and environment.

TI  - The spatial distribution of blue carbon in the coastal wetlands of China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal wetland losses in China are globally-relevant issues, as formerly sequestered soil organic carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere. Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha(-1)) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves, 175.14 for seagrass, and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30-60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0-20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha(-1)), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), were 2.26 +/- 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 +/- 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 +/- 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12-123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr(-1). We estimate the average annual emissions of CO2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO2 yr(-1), due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion.

TI  - Relevance of carbon burial and storage in two contrasting blue carbon ecosystems of a north-east Pacific coastal lagoon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems constitute very productive habitats, characterized by efficient C-org sequestration and long-term preservation in sediments, so they play an important role in climate change mitigation. The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby. Our results highlight the need to protect these environments as relevant carbon reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Organic phosphorus mineralization characteristics in sediments from the coastal salt marshes of a Chinese delta under simulated tidal cycles
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sediment organic phosphorus (OP) mineralization plays an important role in phosphorus cycling in coastal salt marshes. However, information on OP mineralization characteristics in sediments under tidal cycles is limited.Materials and methods Sediment cores were collected from salt marshes which were exposed to tidal cycles. A laboratory manipulation experiment was conducted under simulated tidal flooding cycles. After the completion of each incubation experiment, the inorganic phosphorus (IP) and OP fractions were analyzed and net phosphorus mineralization rates were calculated to investigate the sediment OP mineralization process. Sediment microbial characteristic and chemical properties were determined to identify factors that affect the mineralization of OP in the Yellow River Delta.Results and discussion During the first 2 days of incubation, the tidal cycles significantly increased the microbial biomass in the sediments, which accelerated the assimilation of IP by microorganisms and the transformation of IP into OP in their bodies, thereby causing a significant increase in OP in the sediments. After 2 days of incubation, the mineralization and immobilization of OP entered the adaptation stage and gradually reached the dynamic balance of various phosphorus fractions in sediments. The path analysis showed that microbial biomass phosphorus and carbon (MBP and MBC) and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) are the direct factors influencing OP mineralization in sediments. The indirect effects of soil organic matter (SOM), water content (WC), exchangeable aluminum (Al-0), and exchangeable iron (Fe-0) on net phosphorus mineralization rate were relatively high.Conclusions In the laboratory experiments, we showed that the recovery of tidal cycles caused a fluctuation in OP mineralization and immobilization in sediments, which reached equilibrium over time. The tidal effect was conducive to maintaining the stability of phosphorus in sediments of coastal salt marshes. The findings of this study can contribute to protecting water quality and improving primary productivity in coastal salt marshes by regulating the tidal cycles and the key environmental factors (e.g., SOM, WC, Al-0, and Fe-0) influencing OP mineralization.

AB  - Recent studies have shownthe effect of nitrate (NO3-) on carbon gas emissions from wetland soils that contradict thermodynamic predictions. In this study, CO2 production in three Mississippi River deltaic plain wetland soils (forest swamp, freshwater and saline marshes) with the presence of different NO3- levels (0.2, 2.0, and 3.2 mM) was evaluated in an anaerobic microcosm. Molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of these soils was investigated using pyrolysis-GC/MS, and soil microbial community was characterized based on phosphorus lipid fatty acid (PLFA) method to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Addition of NO3- promoted CO2 production in swamp forest soil, but inhibited CO2 emission from marsh soils. Pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis showed that swamp soil contained more polysaccharides, whereas both marsh soils had high abundance of phenolic compounds. Total PLFAs of forest swamp soil were 34% and 66% higher than freshwater and saline marsh soils, respectively. The PLFA profiles indicated different microbial distribution along a salinity gradient with the forest swamp having a higher proportion of fungi and NO3- reducers but lower sulfate (SO42-) reducers than marsh soils. Overall, the study indicated that the inherent differences in soil DOM and microbial community led to the contrasting response in soil CO2 respiration between forest swamp and marsh ecosystems to NO3- loading. These differences should be considered in determining the fate of nitrate entering Louisiana coastal wetlands from river diversions and other sources and their management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Livestock grazing promotes ecosystem multifunctionality of a coastal salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of livestock grazing on grasslands have garnered much attention; however, little is known about how grazing affects ecosystems' ability to simultaneously support multiple ecosystem functions (i.e. ecosystem multifunctionality, hereafter EMF) in coastal salt marshes. To comprehensively evaluate the ecological effects of livestock grazing and tidal flooding on salt marshes, we conducted a grazing-exclusion experiment in the high and middle marsh zones of the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Livestock grazing generally enhanced EMF in the salt marshes, with a stronger impact in the middle marshes than in the high ones. Although plant biomass, above-ground N of plants, soil organic C and sediment deposition rate decreased under grazing, activities of soil microbes and nematodes, soil N pool, N mineralization, decomposition and soil respiration increased. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that tidal flooding and associated replenishment of sediments may mitigate the negative effects of grazing on plants and sedimentation and strengthen positive grazing impacts on nutrient cycling, consequently reinforcing the beneficial effects of livestock grazing on the salt marsh ecosystem multifunctionality. Our results provide a holistic framework of ecosystem-level responses to livestock grazing in salt marshes and highlight the regulatory role of external environmental factors such as tidal flooding. Although livestock grazing enhanced the overall EMF (represents the nutrient cycling rate) of salt marshes in our study, it was not necessarily desirable for ecosystem services. Integration of ecosystem function-multifunctionality and ecosystem service-multifunctionality of salt marshes need to be recommended in future multifunctionality studies.

TI  - Salt marsh at the tip of Africa: Patterns, processes and changes in response to climate change
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a conceptual understanding of climate change responses of salt marsh in open and closed estuaries and outlined changes in terms of implications for ecosystem services. Changes in salt marsh cover in South Africa were described in relation to prevailing pressures. Salt marshes occur in the sheltered estuaries distributed along the similar to 3000 km coastline. Supratidal salt marsh occurs at elevation greater than 1.5 m amsl and are dominant in the cool temperate (5328.28 ha) and intertidal salt marsh in the warm temperate region (2093.31 ha). Although small in total extent (14 955 ha), salt marshes play a central role in biodiversity conservation because they provide critical habitat for migratory fish and birds. Approximately 43% of salt marsh habitat has been lost due to encroaching development and agriculture from the 1930s to 2018. In addition, salinisation and desiccation resulting from upstream freshwater abstraction reduces freshwater inflow, which extends periods of mouth closure in temporarily closed estuaries causing inundation and flooding of salt marsh. Predicting the combined effects of multiple stressors (increase in storm surges, floods, droughts and reduced river flow) is critical to conserve these important habitats. Research and monitoring to understand salt marsh responses is ongoing because the interface between the subtropical and warm temperate coastal regions of South Africa is expected to be affected by mangrove range expansion. This study is globally relevant as little is known about southern hemisphere salt marshes in Africa and data are needed for comparative purposes.

TI  - Spatial variability of the properties of marsh soils and their impact on vegetation
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability of the properties of soils and the character of vegetation was studied on seacoasts of the Velikii Island in the Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea. It was found that the chemical and physicochemical properties of marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols) are largely dictated by the distance from the sea and elevation of the sampling point above sea level. The spatial distribution of the soil properties is described by a quadratic trend surface. With an increase in the distance from the sea, the concentration of ions in the soil solution decreases, and the organic carbon content and soil acidity become higher. The spatial dependence of the degree of variability in the soil properties is moderate. Regular changes in the soil properties along the sea-land gradient are accompanied by the presence of specific spatial patterns related to the system of temporary water streams, huge boulders, and beached heaps of sea algae and wood debris. The cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish between five soil classes corresponding to the following plant communities: barren surface (no permanent vegetation), clayey-sandy littoral with sparse halophytes, marsh with large rhizomatous grasses, and grass-forb-bunchberry vegetation of forest margins. The subdivision into classes is especially distinct with respect to the concentration of chloride ions. The following groups of factors affect the distribution of vegetation: the composition of the soil solution, the height above sea level, the pH of water suspensions, and the humus content.

TI  - Effects of drainage and soil organic content on growth of Spartina alterniflora (Poaceae) in an artificial salt marsh mesocosm
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - An artificial salt marsh mesocosm was constructed using 680-L polypropylene tanks to determine the effect of soil drainage depth and organic content on growth and rhizome proliferation of the salt marsh smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Soil drainage depth had no effect on accumulation of aerial or subsurface plant tissue, but tanks that had 2.5% soil organic content supported enhanced aerial tissue and rhizome growth compared to tanks that contained sand alone. We propose a mathematical model for predicting the mass of photosynthetically significant leaf tissue without cutting and drying leaves. Implications of these findings for salt marsh creation projects are discussed.

TI  - Dynamics of labile soil organic carbon during the development of mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Labile fractions of soil carbon pools are sensitive to environmental changes, which would influence the stabilization of soil carbon. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.

TI  - Temperate mangrove and salt marsh sediments are a small methane and nitrous oxide source but important carbon store
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal saline wetlands (TSW), such as mangrove and salt marsh systems, provide many valuable ecosystem services, but continue to suffer disturbance, degradation and deforestation. Tropical mangroves perform a critical role in the exchange and storage of terrestrial-marine carbon but can function as a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known of biogeochemical processes in temperate mangrove and salt marsh systems in the southern hemisphere. In this study, the soil/sediment exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O was measured seasonally along a natural transition from melaleuca woodland, salt marsh and into mangroves along the Mornington Peninsula edge of Westernport Bay, Victoria, Australia. Soil/sediment physiochemical properties and sediment C density were measured concurrently.The melaleuca woodland soil was a constant CH4 sink of approximately -25 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) but along the transect this rapidly switched to a weak CH4 source (<5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) in the salt marsh which increased further in the mangrove sediments where emissions of up to 375 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) were measured in summer. Sediment CH4 exchange correlated with salinity, pneumatophore number and the redox potential of sediment water at depth. All three ecosystems were a small N2O source of <10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Soil-atmosphere exchange was dominated by CO2 which showed a significant response according to ecosystem and season along with soil temperature and salinity. Sediment C density was significantly greater in the salt marsh than the mangrove. Salt marsh sediment C density was 168 Mg C ha(-1) which is comparable with that measured globally, whereas the mangrove sediment C density of 145 Mg C ha(-1) is among the lowest reported. Contrary to global patterns in terrestrial soil C content and salt marsh sediment C content, data from our study indicate that mangrove sediments from a cooler, drier temperate latitude may store less C than mangroves in warmer and wetter tropical latitudes. Understanding both C storage and the greenhouse gas balance of TSWs will help us to better value these vulnerable ecosystems and manage them accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lignin chemistry of wetland soil profiles in two contrasting basins of the Louisiana Gulf coast
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies indicate that loss of soil organic matter (SOM) from coastal wetlands can contribute to the hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana coast. In this study, coastal marsh soil profiles of two contrasting basins were investigated for lignin composition in order to assess organic matter source and degradation status under these different wetland formations. The Atchafalaya Basin is undergoing land building whereas the Barataria Basin is experiencing land loss. Lignin monomers were extracted using alkaline CuO oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Marsh soil profiles from the Barataria Basin showed strong lignin storage with two-fold higher lignin contents (sum of vanillyl, syringyl, and cinnamyl phenols, A(8)) than those in the Atchafalaya Basin. Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

TI  - Biodegradation of MC252 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes in two coastal wetlands
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Complementary microbial and geochemical assessment techniques investigated the biodegradation of PAHs and alkanes in salt marshes impacted by crude oil following the Macondo spill. Contamination was observed in the top 10 cm of the marsh profile based on PAH analysis and measurement of the delta C-13 signature of impacted marsh soils. Measurement of evolution of C-13 depleted CO2 indicated mineralization of crude oil ranging from 2.7-12.1 mg CO2-C/m(2)-hr. Changes in weathering ratios of alkylated phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes indicated loss of these 3-ring PAHs consistent with biodegradation. A diverse microbial population was observed at both locations dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and including known hydrocarbon degraders such as Marinobacter and Alcanivorax. There was shared richness between sites and across seasons but results suggested substantial turnover of phylotypes in space and time. Biodegradation of alkanes and alkylated PAHs occurred when oxygen was provided in laboratory reactors but not in the absence of oxygen.

TI  - Vegetation death and rapid loss of surface elevation in two contrasting Mississippi delta salt marshes: The role of sedimentation, autocompaction and sea-level rise
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - From 1990 to 2004, we carried out a study on accretionary dynamics and wetland loss in salt marshes surrounding two small ponds in the Mississippi delta; Old Oyster Bayou (OB), a sediment-rich area near the mouth of the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Chitigue (BC), a sediment-poor area about 70 km to the east. The OB site was stable, while most of the marsh at BC disappeared within a few years. Measurements were made of short-term sedimentation, vertical accretion, change in marsh surface elevation, pond wave activity, and marsh soil characteristics. The OB marsh was about 10 cm higher than BC; the extremes of the elevation range for Spartina alterniflora in Louisiana. Vertical accretion and short-term sedimentation were about twice as high at BC than at OB, but the OB marsh captured nearly all sediments deposited, while the BC marsh captured <30%. The OB and BC sites flooded about 15% and 85% of the time, respectively. Marsh loss at BC was not due to wave erosion. The mineral content of deposited sediments was higher at OB. Exposure and desiccation of the marsh surface at OB increased the efficiency that deposited sediments were incorporated into the marsh soil, and displaced the marsh surface upward by biological processes like root growth, while also reducing shallow compaction. Once vegetation dies, there is a loss of soil volume clue to loss of root turgor and oxidation of root organic matter, which leads to elevation collapse. Revegetation cannot occur because of the low elevation and weak soil strength. The changes in elevation at both marsh sites are punctuated, occurring in steps that can either increase or decrease elevation. When a marsh is low as at BC, a step down can result in an irreversible change. At this point, the option is not restoration but creating a new marsh with massive sediment input either from the river or via dredging. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon sequestration by Australian tidal marshes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia's tidal marshes have suffered significant losses but their recently recognised importance in CO2 sequestration is creating opportunities for their protection and restoration. We compiled all available data on soil organic carbon (OC) storage in Australia's tidal marshes (323 cores). OC stocks in the surface 1 m averaged 165.41 (SE 6.96) Mg OC ha(-1) (range 14-963 Mg OC ha(-1)). The mean OC accumulation rate was 0.55 +/- 0.02 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1). Geomorphology was the most important predictor of OC stocks, with fluvial sites having twice the stock of OC as seaward sites. Australia's 1.4 million hectares of tidal marshes contain an estimated 212 million tonnes of OC in the surface 1 m, with a potential CO2-equivalent value of $USD7.19 billion. Annual sequestration is 0.75 Tg OC yr(-1), with a CO2-equivalent value of $ USD28.02 million per annum. This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of tidal marsh blue carbon in Australia, and illustrates their importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. We outline potential further development of carbon offset schemes to restore the sequestration capacity and other ecosystem services provided by Australia tidal marshes.

TI  - Role of carbonate burial in Blue Carbon budgets
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) often accumulate in mangrove and seagrass sediments. As CaCO3 production emits CO2, there is concern that this may partially offset the role of Blue Carbon ecosystems as CO2 sinks through the burial of organic carbon (C-org). A global collection of data on inorganic carbon burial rates (C-inorg, 12% of CaCO3 mass) revealed global rates of 0.8 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) and 15-62 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. In seagrass, CaCO3 burial may correspond to an offset of 30% of the net CO2 sequestration. However, a mass balance assessment highlights that the C-inorg burial is mainly supported by inputs from adjacent ecosystems rather than by local calcification, and that Blue Carbon ecosystems are sites of net CaCO3 dissolution. Hence, CaCO3 burial in Blue Carbon ecosystems contribute to seabed elevation and therefore buffers sea-level rise, without undermining their role as CO2 sinks.

TI  - Elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition affect the microbial abundance but not the community structure in salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With unique and important characteristics, salt marsh ecosystems are expected to be affected by elevated CO2 and N enrichment. Although various studies have assessed the effects of those changes on the vegetation of salt marshes, little information is available about their impact on microbes. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the microbial community structure of soils responding to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and N addition (N) over 3 years in salt marsh ecosystem. We employed pyrosequencing, T-RFLP analysis, and quantitative PCR to study the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. The overall results indicated that 1) eCO(2) and N affected the microbial abundance but not community structure significantly in salt marsh system, 2) due to their different ecophysiology, the responses of the three different microbial communities to eCO(2) and/or N addition varied with each group, 3) the composition (C3/C4 or diversity) of the plant community was important in structuring the microbial community of salt marsh ecosystems, which generally have low plant diversity, 4) the archaeal and fungal communities responded more strongly to eCO(2) and/or N addition than the bacterial community. This study represents the first comprehensive report of the effects of eCO(2) and/or N addition on the diverse microbial community structures of tidal marsh systems. It suggests that single or combined effect of eCO(2) and N on microbial abundance in salt marsh was obvious, and that the key groups playing an important role in the biogeochemical process can be shifted.

TI  - Use of computed tomography imaging for quantifying coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and particle densities in marsh soils
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.

TI  - Spatial variation of salt-marsh organic and inorganic deposition and organic carbon accumulation: Inferences from the Venice lagoon, Italy
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are ubiquitous features of the tidal landscape governed by mutual feedbacks among processes of physical and biological nature. Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Tidal marsh soils were sampled at low tide along 12 transects along the Skeena River estuary south of Port Edward, British Columbia, in 2014 and 2017. Eight of the transects were on the northeast side of the channel; four were on the southwest side. Sampling locations were stratified according to vegetation type. Usually three pits were excavated to 1 m depth on each transect, with one pit in each of the distinct vegetation zones. Bulk samples were collected from each distinct soil horizon, or where horizons were not clearly differentiated, at 25 cm depth intervals. Core samples of fixed volume were also collected from the same excavations for bulk density determination. Chemical analyses consisted of total C concentration (equivalent to organic C for these non-calcareous materials), total N, pH, and electrical conductivity (a measure of salinity).

TI  - Influence of Water Level Gradient on Marsh Soil Microbial Activity of Calamagrostis angustifolia
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant aboveground biomass, total organic carbon(TOC), microbial biomass carbon(MBC), basal respiration( BR), microbial quotient(C-mic/C-org) and metabolic quotient(qCO(2)) in 0-15 cm and 15-50 cm marsh soil of Calamagrostis angustifolia under different water levels were investigated with controlled experiment. The result showed that water level exerted significant effect on plant biomass, which was the highest under 10 cm waterlogged level and of higher productivity under 0-20 cm waterlogged level. TOC, MBC, BR, C-mic/C-org and qCO(2) differed significantly under different water levels. BR and TOC responded to different waterlogged levels in the same way. BR and TOC of 0-15 cm marsh soil were the highest under 0 cm waterlogged level, however, BR and TOC of 15-50 cm marsh soil decreased respectively with increasing water, which was corresponding with soil MBC and C-mic/C-org, and qCO(2) increased with increasing water. As a result, microbial community is altered and microbial activity is decreasing by increasing waterlogged level, and microbial activity is the lowest under 30 cm waterlogged level, which affects organic carbon accumulation and decomposition.

TI  - &ITSpartina alterniflora&IT invasion affects soil carbon in a C-3 plant-dominated tidal marsh
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon cycle is significantly affected by Spartina alterniflora invasion through its impact on blue carbon in many salt marshes. To determine the impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC), we studied the vertical and horizontal distribution of SOC. And stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the impact of the age of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC in Chongming Dongtan wetland located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The results showed that the SOC concentration was higher in the S. alterniflora community than that in the native Phragmites australis community. The age of invasion and the SOC concentration increased with increasing elevation, while the SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth. The delta C-13 value became less negative at greater depth, which was related to the contribution from C-13-enriched carbon sources after 3 years of invasion. After 7 and 10 years, the delta(13)value became more negative at greater depth in both communities. S. alterniflora had a positive effect on the soil carbon pool, and its contribution was related to soil depth. In the low tidal marshes, the contribution of S. alterniflora was negatively correlated with soil depth, while it was positively correlated with soil depth in the high tidal marshes. The results from this study will contribute to improved understanding of future ecological consequences.

TI  - Effects of cultivation on soil microbiological properties in a freshwater marsh soil in Northeast China
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiang Plain has become an intensive area of land use/cover change in China. However, little is known about the effect of cultivation on soil microbiological properties in this freshwater marsh ecosystem. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of cultivation on mineralizable, microbial biomass, and total C in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) was 4346 +/- 309 mg kg(-1) in undisturbed marsh and 229 mg kg(-1) in soil cultivated for 15 years. Undisturbed marsh soil had the highest microbial quotient (3.64%), which declined with increasing cultivation time (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01). Metabolic quotient increased with increasing cultivation time. Soil C mineralization in undisturbed marsh was 3.5 times that in soil cultivated for I year, and was 12 times that in soil cultivated for 15 years. Cultivation strongly affected measured soil microbiological properties. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Consumer regulation of the carbon cycle in coastal wetland ecosystems
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite escalating anthropogenic alteration of food webs, how the carbon cycle in ecosystems is regulated by food web processes remains poorly understood. We quantitatively synthesize the effects of consumers (herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) on the carbon cycle of coastal wetland ecosystems, 'blue carbon' ecosystems that store the greatest amount of carbon per unit area among all ecosystems. Our results reveal that consumers strongly affect many processes of the carbon cycle. Herbivores, for example, generally reduce carbon absorption and carbon stocks (e.g. aboveground plant carbon by 53% and aboveground net primary production by 23%) but may promote some carbon emission processes (e.g. litter decomposition by 32%). The average strengths of these effects are comparable with, or even times higher than, changes driven by temperature, precipitation, nitrogen input, CO2 concentration, and plant invasions. Furthermore, consumer effects appear to be stronger on aboveground than belowground carbon processes and vary markedly with trophic level, body size, thermal regulation strategy and feeding type. Despite important knowledge gaps, our results highlight the powerful impacts of consumers on the carbon cycle and call for the incorporation of consumer control into Earth system models that predict anthropogenic climate change and into management strategies of Earth's carbon stocks.

TI  - SOURCES AND DISTRIBUTION OF ALIPHATIC-AMINES IN SALT-MARSH SEDIMENT
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological sources and distribution of the aliphatic amines, monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA), were studied in the anoxic marine sediments of Flax Pond salt marsh, Long Island, New York. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Spartina alterniflora releases amines, especially TMA, to salt marsh sediment during decomposition. Benthic animals and phytoplankton also contained high amine concentrations and could be sources of amines to salt marsh sediments either by direct release or during decomposition.MMA, DMA and TMA were present in FP sediment porewaters and solid phases throughout the year. Concentrations generally ranged from 10 nM to 1 mu M in porewaters and 1-100 nmol/g dry wt in the solid phase. DMA dominated the porewater profiles, TMA the exchangeable pool, and MMA the fixed pool of amines. Concentrations varied seasonally with highest concentrations found in the fall when S. alterniflora began to senesce. The C/N ratio of organic matter undergoing decomposition in the sediment was calculated to be 11-12 from the annual sulfate reduction and ammonium and Sigma CO2 production rates. This C/N ratio is higher than the Redfield ratio, again suggesting that S. alterniflora is a major organic matter source to the sediment.

TI  - Inorganic and Black Carbon Hotspots Constrain Blue Carbon Mitigation Services Across Tropical Seagrass and Temperate Tidal Marshes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total organic carbon (TOC) sediment stocks as a CO2 mitigation service require exclusion of allochthonous black (BC) and particulate inorganic carbon corrected for water-atmospheric equilibrium (PICeq). For the first time, we address this bias for a temperate salt marsh and a coastal tropical seagrass in BC hotspots that represent two different blue carbon ecosystems of Malaysia and Australia. Seagrass TOC stocks were similar to the salt marshes with soil depths < 1 m (59.3 +/- 11.3 and 74.9 +/- 18.9 MgC ha(- 1), CI 95 % respectively). Both ecosystems showed larger BC constraints than did their pristine counterparts. However, the seagrass meadows' mitigation services were largely constrained by both higher BC/TOC and PICeq/TOC fractions (38.0 % +/- 6.6 and 43.4 % +/- 5.9 %, CI 95 %) and salt marshes around a third (22 % +/- 10.2 and 6.0 % +/- 3.1 % CI 95 %). The results provide useful data from underrepresented regions, and, reiterates the need to consider both BC and PIC for more reliable blue carbon mitigation assessments to ensure that greenhouse gas emitters do not exceed the ecosystems' capacity.

TI  - Artificial Structures Steer Morphological Development of Salt Marshes: A Model Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are increasingly recognized as resilient and sustainable supplements to traditional engineering structures for protecting coasts against flooding. Nevertheless, many salt marshes face severe erosion. There is a consensus that providing structures that create sheltered conditions from high energetic conditions can improve the potential for salt marsh growth. However, little proof is provided on the explicit influence of structures to promote salt marsh growth. This paper investigates how artificial structures can be used to steer the morphological development of salt marshes. A morphological model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) was applied, which enabled the analysis of various artificial structures with realistic representation. A salt marsh in the Wadden Sea which has seen heavy erosion (lateral retreat rate of 0.9 m/year) served as case study. We simulate both daily and storm conditions. Hereby, vegetation is represented by an increased bed roughness. The model is able to simulate the governing processes of salt marsh development. Results show that, without artificial structures, erosion of the salt marsh and tidal flat continues. With structures implemented, results indicate that there is potential for salt marsh growth in the study area. Moreover, traditional structures, which were widely implemented in the past, proved to be most effective to stimulate marsh growth. More broadly, the paper indicates how morphological development of a salt marsh can be steered by various configurations of artificial structures.

T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - The dataset comprises biochemical measurements of salt marsh soil, and samples from fields on former salt marsh, taken using a soil corer. Sampling was conducted at three restored salt marshes and six accidentally breached sites on the Essex coast, UK, providing a chronosequence from 16 to 114 years since restoration of tidal flow. Natural salt marsh at all sites were also sampled, along with adjacent fields on former salt marsh (where access permitted). All salt marsh sampling took place in October 2011. Field sample sites were sampled between July 2010 and April 2017. This data was collected as part of the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology's Multi-functional land-use options project (C03463) in order to determine the trajectory and timescale of habitat recovery, and provide empirically-based predictions of changes in the rate of carbon sequestration over time following saltmarsh restoration. Data is also represented for fields on former saltmarsh to give a 'before' time point to be able to calculate these changes. Three soil cores were taken at each sampling location using a soil corer measuring 4 centimetres (cm) in diameter and 30 cm in length. There were four sampling locations per salt marsh site, all taken from permanently vegetated marsh above 1.5 m ordnance datum (OD). The fields on former salt marsh had between 2 and 6 sampling sites situated away from field edges. All data derived from laboratory measurements. For each variable, standards were used and all laboratory equipment were calibrated in accordance with the laboratory practises at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Bangor. Results were recorded on to lab sheets and transferred into an Excel file. Results were exported as comma separated value files for ingestion into the EIDC.

TI  - Carbon storage potential in a recently created brackish marsh in eastern North Carolina, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration through accumulated plant biomass and storage in soils can potentially make wetland ecosystems net C sinks. Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g Cm-2 day(-1) through plant photosynthesis. About 41-46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6-13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7-44.7 Mg CO2 year(-1) across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was -0.87 to -0.56 g CO2-eq m(-2) day(-1), indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76-$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431-$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink.

TI  - Decomposition of saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens) in Louisiana coastal marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Louisiana, plant production rates and associated decomposition rates may be important in offsetting high rates of land loss and subsidence in organic marsh soils. Decomposition of Spartina patens shoot and leaf material was studied by using litter bags in mesohaline marshes in the Barataria and Terrebonne basins of coastal Louisiana. Spartina patens decomposed very slowly with an average decay constant of 0.0007, and approximately 50% of the material remained after 2 years in the held. Material at the Barataria site decomposed faster than did Terrebonne material with trend differences apparent during the first 150 days. This difference might be explained by the higher content of phosphorus in the Barataria material or a flooding period experienced by the Barataria bags during their first 10 days of deployment. Nitrogen and carbon content of the plant material studied did not differ between the two basins. We detected no consistent significant differences in decomposition above, at, or below sediment/water level. Because S. patens is the dominant plant in these marshes, and because it is so slow to decompose, we believe that S. patens shoots are an important addition to vertical accretion and, therefore, marsh elevation.

TI  - The effects of condensed tannins derived from senescing Rhizophora mangle leaves on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in a Distichlis spicata salt marsh soil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Due to global warming, it is to be expected that mangroves will move north- and southwards and enter salt marshes, which will then be enriched with mangrove-derived organic compounds. Little is known about the effects that tannins, which are abundantly present in leaf litter of Rhizophora mangle, will have on the biogeochemical cycles in salt marsh soils.Methods In microcosms, soil from a Distichlis spicata salt marsh was enriched with R. mangle-derived leaf powder (LP), crude condensed tannins (CCT) and purified condensed tannins (PCT), or with commercially available tannic acid (TA). Each treatment received a fixed amount of tannins, i.e. 10mg /g dry soil. Due to the enrichment with tannins in each fraction, the amount of carbon added increased from C<TA=PCT<CCT<LP. At Day 7, 21, 35 and 42 of the incubation period, CO2 emission rates were determined after closing the microcosms for 24h. Net nitrogen and phosphorous mineralization rates were also determined for the entire incubation period. Experiments were done at Practical Salinity Units of 20, 28 and 35 to cover the range in salinities observed in the field (20 and 35 PSU).Results For the whole incubation period, the CO2 emission increased significantly (p<0.05) in the order of C<PCT<CCT=TA<LP microcosms. The microcosms with LP showed immobilization of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus, while the other microcosms revealed net nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in the order of CCT<TA<PCT<C for N mineralization, and CCT=TA<C<PCT for P mineralization. The C and N mineralization rates measured at a salinity of 20 PSU were significantly larger than at 28 and 35 PSU.Conclusion The results showed that mangrove leaf litter stimulated net C mineralization and N and P immobilization. Purified condensed tannins of senescing R. mangle leaves enhanced C and P, and suppressed net N mineralization.

TI  - Microbial Enzyme Activities in Tropical Marsh Soils with Different Water Regime
T2  - BIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENT AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Biology, Environment and Chemistry (ICBEC 2010)
CL  - Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Tropical marsh ecosystems play a key role in global carbon cycle. Mineralization of organic matter mediated by enzymes in such systems is of great importance in the cycle but little is known about it. This study assessed a suite of enzyme activities in two- depths of marsh soils with different water regime. Overall, enzyme activities were lower in drier soils than wet soils, suggesting water content would be a key controlling variable for decomposition in the system. Unlike northern peatland, decomposition rates may be lowered by frequent drought that is expected in the future climate.

TI  - Responses of soil inhabiting nitrogen-cycling microbial communities to wetland degradation on the Zoige Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The wetlands on the Zoige Plateau have experienced serious degradation, with most of the original marsh being converted to marsh meadow or meadow. Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities.

TI  - Recent volumetric changes in salt marsh soils
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh sediment volume decreases from organic decomposition, compaction of solids, and de-watering, and each of these processes may change with age. Variability in the vertical accretion rate within the upper 2 m was determined by assembling results from concurrent application of the Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating techniques used to estimate sediment age since 1963/1964, and 0 to ca 100+ years before present (yBP), respectively. The relationship between Pb-210 and the Cs-137 dated accretion rates (Sed(210) and Sed(137), respectively) was linear for 45 salt marsh and mangrove environments. Sed(210) averaged 75% of Sed137 suggesting that vertical accretion over the last 100+ years is driven by soil organic matter accumulation, as shown for the pre Cs-137 dated horizon. The ratio of Sed(210)/Sed(137) declines with increasing mineral content. A linear multiple regression equation that includes bulk density and Sed(137) to predict Sed(210) described 97% of the variance in Sed(210). Sediments from Connecticut, Delaware and Louisiana coastal environments dated with C-14 indicate a relatively constant sediment accretion rate of 0.13 cm year(-1) for 1000-7000 yBP, which occurs within 2 m of today's marsh surface and equals modern sea level rise rates. Soil subsidence is not shown to be distinctly different in these vastly different coastal settings. The major reason why the Sed(137) measurements indicate higher accretion rates than do the Sed(210) measurements is because the former apply to younger sediments where the effects of root growth and decomposition are greater than in the latter. The most intense rates of change in soil volume in organic-rich salt marshes sediments is, therefore, neither in deep or old sediments (> 4 m; > 1000 years), but within the first several hundreds of years after accumulation. The average changes in organic and inorganic constituents downcore are nearly equal for 58 dated sediment cores from the northern Gulf of Mexico. These parallel changes downcore are best described as resulting from compaction, rather than from organic matter decomposition. Thus most of the volumetric changes in these salt marsh sediments occurs in the upper 2 m, and declines quickly with depth. Extrapolation forwards or backwards, using results from the Pb-210 and the Cs-137 dating technique appear to be warranted for the types of samples from the environments described here.

TI  - Fiddler crab burrowing increases salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Salt marshes are globally important sites of carbon burial, but microbial processes in their soil produce potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) that can be released back to the atmosphere. Although a great deal is known about how shifting seasons, tides, and salinity influence salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions, little effort has been devoted to understanding how emissions respond to bioturbation and pollution. In this study, we evaluated how fiddler crab bioturbation and oil pollution altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes from Louisiana salt marsh soil through a series of microcosm incubation experiments. CO2 and CH4 fluxes did not consistently increase as a function of crab burrow depth even though soil CO2 and CH4 concentrations increased with depth. Instead, regardless of burrow depth, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were highest (536.7 +/- 41.6 and 6.35 +/- 0.59 nmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively) immediately after burrowing activity ceased and within similar to 2 h decreased to a low background level (117.4 +/- 17.1 and 0.53 +/- 0.26). These background CO2 fluxes persisted through the end of our experiments, but background CH4 fluxes were not detectable after < 1 day, suggesting an important role for methanotrophy. Therefore, crab burrow size had a strong influence on CO2 fluxes, while the rate of burrow excavation was more important for CH4 fluxes. Low to moderate oil concentrations (up to 25.55 mg cm(-2)) did not alter greenhouse gas fluxes. However, severe oil contamination that decreases fiddler crab abundance and burrowing activity will also indirectly decrease salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions. These findings illuminate the importance of fiddler crab bioturbation to salt marsh carbon cycling and export.

TI  - Salt marshes and eutrophication: An unsustainable outcome
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most plant production by emergent coastal marshes occurs belowground. This belowground production adds to the accumulation of organic matter sustaining salt marshes as sea level rises, thus preventing excessive flooding, eventual plant death, and habitat loss. The ubiquitous nutrient enrichment of coastal salt marshes stimulating aboveground plant growth may result in higher rates of inorganic matter accumulation that compensates for marsh flooding caused by sea level rise. Results from several short-term experiments, however, demonstrate that root and rhizome biomass and carbon accumulation is reduced with nutrient enrichment, suggesting that eutrophication of coastal waters may not be a compensatory counterbalance to the effects of global sea level rise on salt marshes. We show that the net effects of 36 yr of nutrient enrichment in replicated field experiments do not lead to higher organic or inorganic accumulation. Enrichment reduces organic matter belowground and may result in a significant loss in marsh elevation equivalent to about half the average global sea level rise rates. Sustaining and restoring coastal emergent marshes is more likely if they receive less, not more, nutrient loading.

TI  - Ribbed mussel nitrogen isotope signatures reflect nitrogen sources in coastal salt marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The stable nitrogen isotope ratio in tissue of the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa) was investigated as an indicator of the source of nitrogen inputs to coastal salt marshes. Initially, mussels were fed a diet of N-15-enriched algae in the laboratory to determine how the tissue nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) changed with time. Steady-state times were calculated and found to be size dependent, ranging from 206 to 397 d. This indicated that mussels are long-term integrators of delta N-15 from their diet and may reflect nitrogen inputs to a marsh. Next, indigenous mussels were collected from 10 marshes with similar hydrology and geomorphology in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, and mussel delta N-15 Values were evaluated as indicators of nitrogen source. Significant positive correlations were observed between delta N-15 in mussels and the fraction of residential development in the marsh watersheds. In contrast, mussel isotope ratios showed significant negative correlations with the fraction of combined agricultural and recreational land use. These correlations suggested that the mussel nitrogen isotope signature is influenced by nitrogen derived from human activities in the adjoining marsh watershed. A more detailed examination of these relationships indicated that land use practices in close proximity to marshes and estuarine characteristics may also influence the observed nitrogen isotope signature. A simple, empirical model based on the 10 watersheds was developed to predict mussel delta N-15 from land use characteristics. The predictive ability of the model was tested with data from 12 additional marshes having similar geomorphology as the original 10, but differing in hydrology and mode of nutrient input. The model showed that ribbed mussel nitrogen isotope signatures may provide information on the source of nitrogen to coastal areas. This could be of use in developing general policies or strategies for monitoring and assessing coastal eutrophication. In addition, the isotopic ratio of mussels is useful as a proxy for watershed land use practices when assessing ecological responses to nutrient enrichment in coastal marshes.

TI  - Quantifying Slopes as a Driver of Forest to Marsh Conversion Using Geospatial Techniques: Application to Chesapeake Bay Coastal-Plain, United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes, which provide valuable ecosystem services such as flood mitigation and carbon sequestration, are threatened by rising sea level. In response, these ecosystems migrate landward, converting available upland into salt marsh. In the coastal-plain surrounding Chesapeake Bay, United States, conversion of coastal forest to salt marsh is well-documented and may offset salt marsh loss due to sea level rise, sediment deficits, and wave erosion. Land slope at the marsh-forest boundary is an important factor determining migration likelihood, however, the standard method of using field measurements to assess slope across the marsh-forest boundary is impractical on the scale of an estuary. Therefore, we developed a general slope quantification method that uses high resolution elevation data and a repurposed shoreline analysis tool to determine slope along the marsh-forest boundary for the entire Chesapeake Bay coastal-plain and find that less than 3% of transects have a slope value less than 1%; these low slope environments offer more favorable conditions for forest to marsh conversion. Then, we combine the bay-wide slope and elevation data with inundation modeling from Hurricane Isabel to determine likelihood of coastal forest conversion to salt marsh. This method can be applied to local and estuary-scale research to support management decisions regarding which upland forested areas are more critical to preserve as available space for marsh migration.

TI  - Stronger network connectivity with lower diversity of soil fungal community was presented in coastal marshes after sixteen years of freshwater restoration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater input for salt marsh restoration in the Yellow River Delta induced Phragmites australis expansion and thus may cause shifts of soil fungi from halophilic to desalination-adapted species for increased litter decomposition. In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

AB  - This dissertation is based on measurements from a flux tower system utilizing eddy covariance methodology and other micrometeorological sensors during the period from May 2007 to December 2007 at the eastern shore of Virginia, USA over an intertidal salt marsh. Leaf level physiology measurements were undertaken to relate leaf-level exchange processes to ecosystem level. The particular physiology of Spartina alterniflora with a decreased phospho-enol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase activity and low light saturation capacity and its implications on ecosystem level exchange processes are identified. Spartina alterniflora dominated intertidal salt marshes are moderate sinks for carbon fixing about 8-10 mol m-2 s-2 of carbon dioxide during the activegrowth stage, but become source of carbon dioxide during the inactive or winter months. Tidalactivity has a major role in modulating the partitioning of available energy and net ecosystemexchange. The decreased assimilation rates observed under submerged conditions can be interpreted as a possible response of inter-tidal salt marshes to sea level rise as the hydro-period over a marsh increases. Land-sea breeze systems operating in intertidal coastal zones can advect moisture from the ocean surface and ecosystem level flux measurements should be interpreted by considering the advective processes in the interpretation of available energy partitioning. A biophysical model incorporating the C 4 photosynthetic pathway and incorporating the theories of turbulent transport relating source strength to concentration profile have been developed as a tool for accessing ecosystem response to climate forcings.Note: Abstract extracted from PDF file via OCR Copyright: All rights reserved (no additional license for public reuse)

TI  - Measuring sediment deposition and accretion on anthropogenic marshland - Part I: Methodical evaluation and development
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Frisian Halligen (Northern Germany) are inhabited and highly anthropogenic modified coastal marshlands. Today a lack of knowledge about sedimentological parameters prevent for a predicated discussion on their adaptation capacity to recent and future sea-level changes. A combined field and laboratory method to calculate marshland accretion rates based on short-term (2010-2013) measurements of sediment depositions was developed. All studies were carried out at the marshlands of the Halligen Hooge, Langeness and Nordstrandischmoor. One litre LDPE bottles and small synthetic turf mats were used as simple but coast, time and quantity efficient sediment trap devices. Up to a deposition rate, of approximate to 2.0 kg/m(2), both devices gained comparable results. Above this threshold the retention efficiency of the turf mats is decreasing compared to the LDPD bottles. The combined use of bottles and mats, especially when deposition rates are not exceeding the threshold, allows to (1) checking internal consistency of the data, (2) detecting outliers with respect to cattle- or man-made damage, and (3) estimating possible effects of post-storm sediment remobilization. To transfer sediment depositions into rates of vertical accretion, the bulk dry density as well as the organic matter concentration of the correspondent marsh soil was considered using data from shallow percussion cores. These parameters are different among all Halligen. Higher inundation frequencies cause lower soil organic matter concentrations, resulting in higher bulk dry densities (BDD) of the soil (Hooge 0.64 g/cm(3), Langeness 0.67 g/cm(3), Nordstrandischmoor 0.83 g/cm(3)). Autochthonous organic material (by source of the marshland vegetation) contributes by 9.0 +/- 1.4 % (Hooge) to 21.4 +/- 6.6 % (Nordstrandischmoor) to marshland accretion, for a correspondent time scale of 1915-2011. Average accretion rates (2010-2013) were calculated with 1.2 +/- 0.8 mm/a for Langeness, 1.5 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Hooge and 2.6 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Nordstrandischmoor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comparison of a constructed tidal marsh with two adjacent natural tidal marshes was conducted.  The marshes were sampled for fish, shellfish, benthic infauna, marsh surface utilization, vegetation community type, stem density and cover, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, bird utilization, and zooplankton.  The proximity of study sites permitted simultaneous sampling to test for marsh preference by fish and shellfish.  Subsurface organic carbon, Spartina alterniflora stem density, low marsh zone surface utilization, zooplankton abundance and bird nesting sites were all greater in the natural marshes.  Other attributes such as stem density of the high marsh, high marsh zone surface utilization, surface organic carbon, and benthic infauna community structure and abundance were similar between the constructed and natural marshes.  Seasonal differences were observed for fish and shellfish abundance between the constructed and natural marshes.  The study is among the first to use simultaneous sampling techniques to investigate fish and shellfish use between constructed and adjacent natural reference wetlands.

AB  - In this paper, an incubation test with soil columns was carried out for 35 days to study the dynamics of DOC leaching from the organic layers (2 approximately 13 cm) of two meadow marsh soils, and the correlation of DOC release with soil respiration, NH4+ formation, and leachate pH. The results showed that in the first week, DOC release presented a fast decrease, and then held on a steady level, which could be well described by one order exponential equation (R2 > 0.96, P < 0.05). During 35 days incubation, the cumulative release of DOC from two test soils was 210.9 microg C x g(-1) and 506.58 microg C x g(-1), and the cumulative emission of CO2 was 679.64 microg C x g(-1) and 455.54 microg C x g(-1), respectively. It was suggested that in the course of incubation, the lower DOC release might be related to the microbial carbon limitation because of the greater CO2 production rate. A significantly positive correlation was found between DOC release and NH4+ formation (rXI = 0.886, P<0.05; rXII = 0.972, P<0.01), while no significant correlation was observed between DOC release and leachate pH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the nitrogen mineralization potential of meadow marsh soil was the main factor affecting DOC production.

TI  - Effect of reclamation on soil organic carbon pools in coastal areas of eastern China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal wetlands of eastern China form one of the most important carbon sinks in the world. However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.

TI  - Ecological parameter reductions, environmental regimes, and characteristic process diagram of carbon dioxide fluxes in coastal salt marshes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the ecological parameter reductions (termed "similitudes") and characteristic patterns of the net uptake fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in coastal salt marshes using dimensional analysis method from fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering. Data collected during May-October, 2013 from four salt marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuary, Massachusetts, USA were utilized to evaluate the theoretically-derived dimensionless flux and various ecological driver numbers. Two meaningful dimensionless groups were discovered as the light use efficiency number (LUE=CO2 normalized by photosynthetically active radiation) and the biogeochemical number (combination of soil temperature, porewater salinity, and atmospheric pressure). A semi-logarithmic plot of the dimensionless numbers indicated the emergence of a characteristic diagram represented by three distinct LUE regimes (high, transitional, and low). The high regime corresponded to the most favorable (high temperature and low salinity) condition for CO2 uptake, whereas the low regime represented an unfavorable condition (low temperature and high salinity). The analysis identified two environmental thresholds (soil temperature similar to 17 degrees C and salinity similar to 30 ppt), which dictated the regime transitions of CO2 uptake. The process diagram and critical thresholds provide important insights into the CO2 uptake potential of coastal wetlands in response to changes in key environmental drivers.

TI  - Spatial gradients in plant leaf wax D/H across a coastal salt marsh in southern California
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh ecosystems contain strong environmental gradients that are anticipated to influence the D/H ratios recorded in the leaf waxes of salt-tolerant plants. We characterized the molecular and hydrogen isotopic composition of alkanes in plant and sediment samples as well as the D/H ratios of environmental and plant waters across an elevation and inundation gradient in a southern Californian, coastal salt marsh. We sampled the dominant salt marsh plant species: Salicornia virginica, Arthrocnemum subterminale and Jamuea carnosa (all succulents), as well as Monanthochloe littoralis and Limonium californicum (nonsucculents). Plant xylem water hydrogen isotopic compositions indicate a shift in source waters from meteoric influences at upland sites (delta D value -20 parts per thousand) to seawater dominated values (0 parts per thousand) at lowland areas. We found leaf water D enrichment relative to xylem water ranging from mean dD values of +54 parts per thousand(upland) to +28 parts per thousand (lowland), interpreted as a reduction of transpiration with increasing inundation time. This has the effect of increasing the net fractionation between source water and leaf wax product across the environmental gradient from mean values of -101 parts per thousand (upland) to -134 parts per thousand (lowland), with an attenuated signal recorded in the dD values of plant leaf wax n-alkanes (-122 parts per thousand to -136 parts per thousand). These results constrain the hydrogen isotopic composition of salt marsh organic matter that may contribute to marine carbon budgets of the Santa Barbara Basin, and further indicate the potential for plant leaf waxes to resolve paleoenvironmental change, including sea level change, in sediment cores from salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Quantification of organic carbon concentrations and stocks of tidal marsh sediments via mid-infrared spectroscopy
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Reducing the current uncertainty on the amount of OC stored these sediments requires the analysis of a large number of sediment samples. Soil sensing techniques, using mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been proven to be a valid alternative for standard OC measurements in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the application of these techniques to tidal marsh sediments has been very limited and the error associated with calculated sedimentary OC stocks using MIR spectroscopy/PLSR data has up till now not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the potential of MIR spectroscopy/PLSR to predict the OC concentration and OC stock of tidal marsh sediments in a temperate estuary (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and The Netherlands). Based on a cross -validation procedure, the results show that MIR spectroscopy/PLSR predicts the OC concentration of tidal marsh sediments along the entire estuary with a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.56% OC). Similar accuracies were obtained for the prediction of sedimentary OC concentrations from independent tidal marshes. Organic carbon concentrations from tidal marshes in the salt portion of the estuary were, however, predicted more accurately using a PLSR model trained exclusively with sediment samples from this salinity zone. Combining depth profiles of predicted OC concentrations with measured bulk densities resulted in predictions of total OC stocks with a relative error < 4% for freshwater and brackish marshes, while errors for salt marshes were up to 30%. As MIR spectroscopy/PLSR is not able to accurately predict bulk density or OC density, standard field measurements of bulk density remain necessary to reliably predict sedimentary OC stocks in tidal marshes.

TI  - Constraining Marsh Carbon Budgets Using Long-Term C Burial and Contemporary Atmospheric CO2 Fluxes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide that respond to environmental changes related to sea level rise and climate. Here we assess how climatic variations affect marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in the short term and compare it to long-term burial rates based on radiometric dating. The 5years of atmospheric measurements show a strong interannual variation in atmospheric carbon exchange, varying from -104 to -233gCm(-2)a(-1) with a mean of -17932gCm(-2)a(-1). Variation in these annual sums was best explained by differences in rainfall early in the growing season. In the two years with below average rainfall in June, both net uptake and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were less than in the other three years. Measurements in 2016 and 2017 suggest that the mechanism behind this variability may be rainfall decreasing soil salinity which has been shown to strongly control productivity. The net ecosystem carbon balance was determined as burial rate from four sediment cores using radiometric dating and was lower than the net uptake measured by eddy covariance (mean: 11013gCm(-2)a(-1)). The difference between these estimates was significant and may be because the atmospheric measurements do not capture lateral carbon fluxes due to tidal exchange. Overall, it was smaller than values reported in the literature for lateral fluxes and highlights the importance of investigating lateral C fluxes in future studies.

TI  - Impact of exposure of crude oil and dispersant (COREXIT (R) EC 9500A) on denitrification and organic matter mineralization in a Louisiana salt marsh sediment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the 2010 oil spill from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, this experiment aims to study the ecological impact of the crude oil and dispersant (COREXIT (R) EC 9500A) in a coastal salt marsh ecosystem. The marsh sediment was incubated under an anaerobic condition with exposure to the crude oil or/and dispersant. The experiments were conducted in two continuous phases of nitrate addition to study denitrification potential using acetylene blockage technique and organic matter mineralization potential indicated by CO2 production in the sediment. Results show that the oil slightly (with no statistical significance p > 0.05) increased both the denitrification and organic matter mineralization activities, likely due to oil components serving as additional organic matter. In contrast, the dispersant significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited denitrification, but stimulated organic matter mineralization activities in the sediment due to unknown mechanisms. As a consequence, redox potentials (Eh) were much lower in the dispersant treated systems. The ecological impacts from the dispersant exposure may come from two fronts. First, loss of organic matter from the coastal marsh will threaten the long-term stability of the ecosystem, and the decrease in denitrification activity will weaken the N removal efficiency. Secondly, more reducing conditions developed by the dispersant exposure will likely preserve the oil in the ecosystem for an extended period of time due to weaker oil biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.

TI  - Marsh construction techniques influence net plant carbon capture by emergent and submerged vegetation in a brackish marsh in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes play an important role in global carbon cycles, yet coastal development has led to widespread losses of marsh habitat. To address this problem, many coastal wetlands have been restored or created over the past several decades using a variety of construction techniques, but it is unclear if net plant carbon capture in constructed marshes is equal to that of reference marshes, or if rates of plant carbon capture are influenced by marsh construction techniques. To comparatively assess relative carbon capture by emergent and submerged vegetation in constructed and reference marshes, we measured standing biomass and carbon content in above- and belowground emergent plant tissue and submerged vegetation in three constructed areas (2-3 years old) and one reference area in a brackish marsh in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in 2009 and 2010. We also used aerial photographs to construct a GIS database of emergent and submerged vegetation coverage. These data were combined to estimate net annual plant carbon capture per square meter of marsh vegetation in each constructed and reference area. This index of carbon input to wetland vegetation suggests that rates of carbon capture by emergent aboveground vegetation and submerged aquatic vegetation were similar in constructed and reference areas. However, submerged vegetation captured less carbon (0.1-0.3 kg m(-2)) than emergent vegetation (0.2-1.7 kg m(-2)), and constructed areas contained an order of magnitude less emergent habitat than the reference area. Consequently, the annual carbon production of entire constructed areas (emergent + submerged vegetation; 0.1-1.2 kg m(-2)) was always less than half that of the reference area (0.8-2.5 kg m(-2)). Therefore, although productivity of emergent and submerged vegetation in constructed and reference areas was similar, the smaller ratio of land to water in the constructed areas reduced their annual rate of plant carbon capture at a larger spatial scale. To more closely mimic rates of plant carbon capture in reference marsh habitats, constructed marsh designs should aim to replicate the ratio of land to water in adjacent reference marshes.

AB  - An in situ field investigation was conducted to study the distribution characteristics and related affecting factors of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in two types of Deyeuxia angustifolia marsh soils in Sanjiang Plain. In D. angustifolia wet meadow and D. angustifolia marsh meadow, the soil MBC and DOC contents in May-September were averagely 769.2 and 312.3 mg.kg(-1), and 2447.3 and 404.4 mg.kg(-1), and the proportions of soil MBC and DOC to soil total organic carbon were 2.50% and 1.03%, and 3.53% and 0.59%,respectively. Both the soil MBC and the soil DOC had the characteristics of obvious seasonal change, and their contents decreased with soil depth. Organic matter input, humus content, and water condition were the main factors affecting the distribution of soil MBC and DOC in D. angustifolia marsh soils.

M3  - Article
AB  - Through two years located field observation, this paper studied the responses of marsh soil temperature to air temperature and the effects of soil temperature on CO emission from marsh sod-vegetation system, and calculated the seasonal variation of CO2 emission. The results showed that from the beginning of thawing, an increasing trend of soil temperature was exerted by the change of air temperature, and there was a significant exponential correlation between soil temperature in root layer and air temperature (R-2 = 0.94, P < 0.01). Despite of the decreased responses of soil temperature to air temperature with increasing soil depth, the CO2 emission from marsh soil-vegetation system was strongly exponentially correlated with soil temperature in root layer (R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.01). An improved model equation was used for calculating the mean CO2 efflux from marsh soil-vegetation system during the growth season in 2003, and the calculated CO2 efflux was 664.5 +/- 213.9 mg (.) m(-2) (.) h(-1), approaching the value of located field observation (634.0 +/- 227.7 mg (.) m(-2 .) h(-1)), indicating that this model equation was effective to evaluate the CO2 emission from marsh during growth season.

TI  - Quantifying how changing mangrove cover affects ecosystem carbon storage in coastal wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.

TI  - Tidal exchange of total mercury and methylmercury between a salt marsh and a Chesapeake Bay sub-estuary
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the net exchange of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) between a tidal marsh and its adjacent estuary over a 1-year period from August 2007 to July 2008. Our objectives were to estimate the importance of tidal salt marshes as sources and sinks of mercury within the Chesapeake Bay system, and to examine the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on mercury fate and transport in tidal marshes. Tidal flows and water chemistry were measured at an established tidal flume at the mouth of the principal tidal creek of a 3-ha marsh section at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Fluxes were estimated by combining continuous tidal flow measurement for the entire study year, with discrete, hourly, flow-weighted measurements of filterable and particulate THg and MeHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) made over 20 tidal cycles during the year. We found that the marsh was a relatively small net tidal source of MeHg, mainly during the warmer growing season. We also confirmed that the marsh was a substantial source of DOC to the adjacent estuary. DOC was a significant predictor of both filterable THg and MeHg fluxes. However, although the marsh was a source of filterable THg, it was overall a net sink for THg because of particulate trapping. The net per-area annual flux of MeHg from tidal marshes is greater than other MeHg pathways within Chesapeake Bay. The annual load of MeHg from tidal marshes into Chesapeake Bay, however, is likely small relative to fluvial fluxes and efflux from bottom sediment. This study suggests that MeHg production within the tidal marsh has greater consequences for biota inhabiting the marsh than for the efflux of MeHg from the marsh.

TI  - Effect of time on the natural regeneration of salt marsh
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of time on natural regeneration of two salt marshes was studied in relation to plant and edaphic factors. The study was carried out in two naturally restoring salt marshes, differing in restoration time, in Txingudi (Bay of Biscay). After 20 yr, the younger salt marsh had the same plant species richness and high species similarity as a 35 yr old salt marsh (17 and 16, respectively, similarity index = 0.9), but both sites had lower species richness and similarity than a nearby natural salt marsh (36 plant species and similarity indices of 0.45 with the 35 yr old marsh and 0.46 with the 20 yr old marsh). Plant species present in the two recovering salt marshes followed a similar distribution pattern in relation to organic matter, conductivity and moisture content although this zonation differed from the natural salt marsh. The range of edaphic factors measured was also similar, but differed from those in the natural salt marsh. The process of plant species recolonization and spatial distribution might be delayed by a low probability of species arrival and by the time need for the restoration of hydrologic and edaphic factors. This study supports the necessity of long-term monitoring in measuring coastal salt marsh restoration.

TI  - Loss of 'Blue Carbon' from Coastal Salt Marshes Following Habitat Disturbance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased recognition of the global importance of salt marshes as 'blue carbon' (C) sinks has led to concern that salt marshes could release large amounts of stored C into the atmosphere (as CO2) if they continue undergoing disturbance, thereby accelerating climate change. Empirical evidence of C release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare, yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes. Here we investigated the stability of salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora) sediment C levels following seagrass (Thallasia testudinum) wrack accumulation; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes. At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term 'refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.

TI  - Oxygen demand and sulfate reduction in petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated salt marsh soils
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted using salt marsh cores to determine the oxygen demand exerted by spilled crude oil and fertilizers added to stimulate biodegradation. Measurements of oxygen uptake and CO2 efflux in flooded and non-flooded cores were conducted in addition to measurements of the magnitude and depth distribution of sulfate reduction rates using (SO42-)-S-35. Additions of crude oil and fertilizers increased sediment oxygen demand (SOD) by a factor of 1.5 to through a combination of enhanced aerobic respiration and sulfate reduction. A strong dependency was observed between the oxygen demand and the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration when crude oil and fertilizers were added. Oiled,Fertilized cores did nor exhibit an SOD higher than control cores when overlying dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 5 mg/l. Crude oil stimulated sulfate reduction rates by a factor of two under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Highest sulfate reduction rates were observed in the top 2cm of marsh. Oxygen demand was apportioned between sulfide oxidation and aerobic respiration. Appointment of SOD indicated that despite doubling of the sulfate reduction rate, most of the demand in non-flooded cores (65%) is exerted by aerobic respiration with the majority of this demand exerted by hydrocarbon degrading organisms. When examined together, data indicate that significant biodegradation of crude oil in salt marshes occurs only when the tidal cycle exposes the surface of the salt marsh to the atmosphere.

AB  - Methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) emission rates from southern California coastal salt marshes show large spatial and temporal variabilities that are strongly linked to biological and environmental factors. Here we discuss biogeochemical lines of evidence pointing to vegetation as the primary source of CH3Br and CH3Cl emissions from salt marshes. Sediments and macroalgae do not appear to be major producers of these compounds, based on observations that the highest fluxes are not inhibited by soil inundation; their emissions are not correlated with those of certain gases produced in soils; and emissions from mudflat- and macroalgae-dominated sites are relatively small. In contrast, the seasonal and spatial variabilities of methyl halide fluxes in these salt marshes are consistent with the production of these compounds by vascular plants, although the possibility of production by microflora or fungi associated with the salt marsh vegetation is not ruled out. Flux chamber measurements of emission rates are largely correlated to the overall plant biomass enclosed in the chamber, but appear also to be highly dependent on the predominant plant species. Emission rates follow a diurnal trend similar to the trends of ambient air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but not surface soil temperature. Diurnal variabilities in the carbon isotope compositions of CH3Cl and CH3Br and their relative ratios of emissions are consistent with simultaneously competing mechanisms of uptake and production.

TI  - Salt Marsh Carbon Pool Distribution in a Mid-Atlantic Lagoon, USA: Sea Level Rise Implications
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of carbon (C) within a salt marsh may vary among vegetation zones depending on production and decomposition dynamics and organic and mineral depositional history. We examined spatial and temporal variation of plant and soil C pools within a salt marsh fringing a coastal lagoon along the mid-Atlantic coast of the U. S. The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas. Belowground C pool loss was 36% less for S. patens than S. alterniflora and was similar between S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus. Accretion and C accumulation rates were greater in the S. alterniflora-dominated stand than in the J. roemerianus-dominated stand. Our results suggest that landward migration onto terrestrial soils can lead to an estimated 80% increase in belowground plant C composed primarily of fine roots and dlm and 36-70% increase in soil carbon between 15 and 30 cm depths.

TI  - Chemical soil properties of reclaimed marsh soil from Zhejiang Province PR China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Initial pedogenesis of reclaimed saline marsh soils was studied along a chronosequence of reclaimed land at Hangzhou Bay, Zhejiang Province, P.R. China. The objective was to compare soil development of these soils with processes known for natural saline marsh soil development and to evaluate the presented form of artificial land recovery against the background of increasing population densities in China. Electrical conductivity (water) and exchangeable sodium percentage decreased rapidly after reclamation started. The decrease in pH and carbonate content suggest an incipient decalcification. Soil organic carbon decreased in the first 30 cm within 20 years, caused by mineralization of the organic sea sediments. After this process an accumulation of soil organic carbon due to organic matter input as a result of farming was observed. At all sites total contents of calcium, magnesium and potassium were classified as elevated to high and decreased slightly within 31 years after reclamation and commencement of agricultural use. Only total phosphorus increased after construction of embankments, attributed to the application of fertilizer phosphorus. Available nutrient contents developed differently but none showed significant trends. Calcium slightly decreased as an effect of reclamation. Processes of pedogenesis were comparable to those known for natural marshes, but had an initial character. The reclamation of land in the presented manner is considered important to support high and growing population densities in China. However, agricultural management and fertilizer application has to be carefully evaluated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI  - Using Hydrological-Biogeochemical Linkages to Elucidate Carbon Dynamics in Coastal Marshes Subject to Relative Sea Level Rise
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are an important component of the global carbon cycle, yet our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to sea level rise (SLR) is limited. Coastal marsh hydrology varies based on elevation, distance from channel, and hydraulic properties, resulting in zones of unique water level oscillation patterns. These zones impact ecology and geochemistry and correspond to differences in carbon accumulation rates. These physical-biogeochemical linkages enable use of a hydrological model to predict changes in marsh zonation, and in turn carbon accumulation, as well as groundwater-surface water exchange under SLR. Here, we developed a calibrated hydrological model of a Delaware coastal marsh using HydroGeoSphere. We simulated three scenarios each of SLR, sediment accretion, and upland hydrologic response, and we quantified changes in the spatial coverage of different hydrologic zonations and groundwater-surface water exchange. Results show that relative SLR reduces marsh area, carbon burial, and lateral water fluxes. However, the magnitudes of change are linked to the terrestrial groundwater table response as well as relative SLR. In scenarios where the upland water table does not change with SLR, the magnitude of decline in marsh area and carbon accumulation is reduced compared to scenarios where the upland water table keeps pace with SLR. In contrast, the reduction in lateral water flux is minimized in scenarios with an upland water table rise equal to SLR compared to scenarios where the upland water table is held at present-day levels. This study highlights the importance of regional hydrologic setting in the fate of coastal marsh dynamics.Plain Language Summary Coastal marshes are efficient carbon sinks, but their location at the land-sea interface makes them vulnerable to sea level rise. Through a web of complex interactions, coastal marsh hydrology, which is spatially variable, impacts carbon burial. This link between ecosystem processes enables the use of a physical, hydrological model to forecast changes in hydrology under variable relative sea level rise scenarios that can be related to alterations in carbon accumulation across the marsh. Our results show that both sea level and the water table on land impact coastal marsh hydrology. Results show a decrease in marsh area and carbon sequestration capacity with sea level rise, and variations in relative sea level rise and groundwater table response to climate change impact the magnitude of these effects.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon source and storage with sea level rise-induced transgression in a Chesapeake Bay marsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter (OM) accumulation in marsh soils affects marsh survival under rapid sea-level rise (SLR). This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay. This presents a possible mechanism for OM stabilization as marshes migrate inland. Regional index terms: USA, Maryland, Chesapeake Bay, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

TI  - Data from: How the litter-feeding bioturbator Orchestia gammarellus promotes late successional salt marsh vegetation
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - 1.Traditionally, studies on vegetation succession have focused either on plant-plant interactions, or on interactions between plants and their physical environment, e.g. through organic matter build-up and increased nutrient cycling. These interactions can change conditions for macrodetritivores that feed on plant litter, but their role in vegetation succession is rarely studied. In this paper we explore whether the bioturbating crustacean macrodetritivore Orchestia gammarellus alters soil conditions in a salt marsh ecosystem in such a way that it promotes late successional, less stress-tolerant plant species at the expense of early successional species. 2.To answer this, we performed a field and a laboratory experiment in which we manipulated abundances of O. gammarellus, and studied the consequences for soil physical and chemical parameters and for vegetation community composition. 3.Our field experiment showed that O. gammarellus stimulated nitrogen mineralization, likely resulting from the positive effect of this macrodetritivore on soil aeration and litter decomposition. Moreover, results from the laboratory experiment showed that O. gammarellus negatively affected dicot seedling survival of mainly early successional plant species, likely through grazing, thus affecting plant community composition. 4.The experiments together provided evidence that O. gammarellus promotes late successional plant species in multiple ways: by alleviation of anoxic conditions, by promoting nutrient cycling and by selective herbivory on early successional species. 5.Synthesis: By demonstrating that a species traditionally considered as part of the detrital (brown) food web is thus an important accelerator of vegetation succession, this study documents an important but often overlooked link in food web and ecosystem ecology.

M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes form along coastlines and are very interesting ecosystems due to their function and services. In the future, salt marsh plants might provide food and medicine as crops irrigated via seawater in hyper arid regions. In the Arabian Gulf, little is known about salt marsh vegetation. Therefore, a targeted search on scientific literature was performed to provide a comprehensive assessment. Hence, current knowledge of the extent and status of salt marsh in the Arabian Gulf region was reviewed, based on literature-based analysis. Then, historic trends of salt marsh publications were carefully inspected. This study provides a list of salt marsh families and their genera and species, with a total of 51 family 179 genera 316 species in the Arabian Gulf. The largest family was Chenopodiaceae followed by Poaceae, Asteraceae. Moreover, this study identified some of the gaps that could help future directions for scientific research, and help making decisions of conservation, management policies and procedures.

TI  - Effects of Geomorphology on the Distribution of Metal Abundance in Salt Marsh Sediment
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of salt marsh geomorphology on the distribution of surface metal content. Surface sediment samples (46) were taken along two transects across an intertidal salt marsh island. Abundance of Ca, Al, Fe, Ni, Cr, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, As, and Zr vary up to 300 % with statistically significant differences along transects and between transects. Along transect, metal abundances are strongly influenced by elevation and distance from the subtidal channel. Between transects, salt marsh morphodynamics, relative marsh age, and water sources seem to affect metal distribution. These observations lead us to hypothesize that at least three scales of variability can be expected for assessing salt marsh sediment metal distributions. Larger-scale variations associated with salt marsh sediment sources and age, and another related to local salt marsh geomorphic structure. Therefore, studies that characterize salt marsh metal loading should explicitly consider the variability imposed over a range of spatial scales.

TI  - Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

TI  - Soil Net Nitrogen Mineralization in Salt Marshes with Different Flooding Periods in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variation of inorganic nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization of soils were investigated by using in situ incubation method in three wetlands with different flooding periods (i.e., short-term, seasonal, and tidal flooding) in the Yellow River Delta, China. Results showed that N mineralization in short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands could be classified into one group. Inorganic nitrogen showed higher concentrations during the period from spring to early summer, and then it decreased after June for short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands. Net N mineralization rate appeared negative value but sequently increased and reached the positive maximum value during the period from late autumn to early winter. However, in tidal flooding wetland, both inorganic N and N mineralization rate kept relative constant. The effects of inundation due to water and sediment regulation were different on three wetlands. Inorganic N contents in soil decreased in short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands whereas increased in tidal flooding wetland. The changing tendency of net N mineralization rate was opposite to that of ammonium rate.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal distribution of nitrogen in marsh soils of a typical floodplain wetland in Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal and profile distributions of nitrogen in marsh soils in different seasons were studied in a typical site within the Erbaifangzi wetland in Northeast China. Results showed that there was higher spatial heterogeneity for nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), as well as available nitrogen (AN), in surface soils in July compared to that in September. Relative to July, the mean nitrogen contents in surface soils were slightly higher in September; however, in November, soils contained significantly lower NO3--N and NH4+-N, higher AN, organic nitrogen (Org-N), and total nitrogen (TN). Except for mineral nitrogen, no significant differences were observed between Org-N and TN contents in September and November. Nitrogen contents generally declined exponentially with depth along soil profiles in three sampling dates (July, September, and November), except for a significant accumulation peak of NO3--N at the 20-30 cm depth in September. However, NH4+-N contents showed a vertical alternation of "increasing and decreasing" in both July and September, while nearly kept constant with depth in November. The depth ranking of nitrogen showed the shallowest distribution for AN, followed by Org-N and TN, while deeper distributions for NO3--N and NH4+-N. TN, Org-N, and AN were significantly correlated with soil organic matter and total phosphorus. Soil pH values were significantly correlated with TN and AN contents in surface soils. Clay contents showed significant correlations with nitrogen contents except for NO3--N in surface soils and NH4+-N in profile soils. However, soil moisture was not significantly correlated with nitrogen contents among all soil samples.

TI  - Organism-induced accumulation of iron, zinc and arsenic in wetland soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impact of rhizosphere/burrow oxidation by wetland plants and burrowing invertebrates on the biogeochemistry of metals and metalloids in salt marsh ecosystems. It was hypothesised that salt marsh plants and burrowing invertebrates could considerably affect the retention capacity of wetlands for metals through oxidation of the rhizosphere/burrow wall.Various soil, plant and porewater samples were collected from areas dominated by the plant species Spartina townsendii and Atriplex portulacoides and by the lugworm Arenicola marina, and from corresponding nearby unvegetated/uninhabited sites at North Bull Island salt marsh, Dublin Bay, Ireland. Samples were analysed for total Fe, Zn and As. The organic matter content (LOT), bulk density, water content and dry/fresh weight ratio of rhizosphere, burrow wall and bulk soil was measured for each species. DCB-extractable Fe, Zn and As, associated with the iron plaque on the roots of the two plant species were also determined.The presence of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, burrowing organisms were shown to have a significant effect on the concentration and accumulation of heavy metals in salt marsh soils. Iron and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher in vegetated/inhabited sails compared to nearby unvegetated/uninhabited areas. Zinc showed the same trend but the difference was not statistically significant. The concentrations of Fe and As were also significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil around the plant roots and in the burrow walls of Arenicola compared to the bulk soil. For zinc, the same pattern was significant only for S. townsendii-dominated soils. Atriplex stands appeared to have the greatest potential for heavy metal accumulation with concentrations reaching 1238 mu mol Fe g(-1), 4.9 mu mol Zn g(-1) and 512 nmol As g(-1) in the rhizosphere. The Zn/Fe ratio for S. townsendii and the As/Fe ratios for both plant species also increased from the bulk soil towards the roots. Concentrations of Zn and As appeared to correlate with both Fe concentrations and LOI values. However, covariation was significant only with Fe, indicating that it is the oxidation of Fe, rather than the binding to organic matter, that drives the accumulation of Zn and As. The amount of each element present in the various compartments associated with the plants (the sum of the element concentrations in the rhizosphere, ironplaque and roots) in I litre of the top 20 cm of soil, amounted to 0.84% for Fe, 3.6% for Zn and 2.8% for As for S. townsendii, and 12.5% for Fe, 19% for Zn and 18.3% for As for A. portulacoides. Densities of A. marina were never higher than 1 per litre of top sail so the small volume of burrow wall soil would therefore render that pool of negligible size compared to the rhizospheres of plants. It is likely that lugworms affect the movement of metals more importantly through bioturbation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Effects of middle-term land reclamation on nickel soil-water interaction: a case study from reclaimed salt marshes of Po River Delta, Italy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclaimed salt marshes are fragile environments where water salinization and accumulation of heavy metals can easily occur. This type of environment constitutes a large part of the Po River Delta (Italy), where intensive agricultural activities take place. Given the higher Ni background of Po River Delta soils and its water-soluble nature, the main aim of this contribution is to understand if reclamation can influence the Ni behavior over time. In this study, we investigated the geo-chemical features of 40 soils sampled in two different localities from the Po River Delta with different reclamation ages. Samples of salt marsh soils reclaimed in 1964 were taken from Valle del Mezzano while soils reclaimed in 1872 were taken nearby Codigoro town. Batch solubility tests and consecutive determination of Ni in pore-water were compared to bulk physicochemical compositions of soils. Bulk Ni content of the studied soils is naturally high, since these soils originated from Po River sediments derived from the erosion of ultramafic rocks. Moreover, it seems that Ni concentration increases during soil evolution, being probably related to the degradation of serpentine. Instead, the water-soluble Ni measured in the leaching tests is greater in soils recently reclaimed compared to the oldest soils. Soil properties of two soil profiles from a reclaimed wetland area were examined to determine soil evolution over one century. Following reclamation, pedogenic processes of the superficial horizons resulted in organic matter mineralization, pH buffer, and a decrease of Ni water solubility from recently to evolved reclaimed soil.

TI  - Spatial variability of phosphorus sorption dynamics in Louisiana salt marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry has been studied in multiple wetland ecosystems, though few data exist on P sorption in U.S. Gulf Coast marshes. There also is a limited understanding of how oil spills in coastal zones can influence P dynamics in wetland soils. In this study, we measured P sorption potential, using the P sorption index (PSI), soil properties, and P saturation at increasing distances from the marsh edge in oiled and unoiled marshes in three regions along the southeastern Louisiana coast (Terrebonne Bay, western, and eastern Barataria Bay). Individual PSI values were highly variable, ranging from 19.5 to 175.6mg P 100g(-1) and varying by at least a factor of five within each of the three regions, and did not significantly differ between regions or between oiled and unoiled marshes. Soil pH, organic matter, total N, N:P ratio, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, and P saturation differed between regions, and all soil parameters showed great variability between and within individual marshes. Extractable iron was the strongest predictor of PSI across all regions, explaining between 51 and 95% of the variability in individual regions. PSI increased with distance from marsh edge in Terrebonne Bay where other soil properties exhibited similar trends. Results suggest mineral composition of marsh soils, influenced by elevation-inundation gradients, are critical in dictating P loading to estuaries and open waters, and overall marsh functioning. Further, within 2 years of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oiled marshes are able to sorb phosphorus at comparable levels as unoiled marshes.

TI  - Salt marsh monitoring along the mid-Atlantic coast by Google Earth Engine enabled time series
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide a bulwark against sea-level rise (SLR), an interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, important nursery grounds for many species, a buffer against extreme storm impacts, and vast blue carbon repositories. However, salt marshes are at risk of loss from a variety of stressors such as SLR, nutrient enrichment, sediment deficits, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances. Determining the dynamics of salt marsh change with remote sensing requires high temporal resolution due to the spectral variability caused by disturbance, tides, and seasonality. Time series analysis of salt marshes can broaden our understanding of these changing environments. This study analyzed aboveground green biomass (AGB) in seven mid-Atlantic Hydrological Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds. The study revealed that the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed had the highest average loss and the largest net reduction in salt marsh AGB from 1999-2018. The study developed a method that used Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled time series of the Landsat archive for regional analysis of salt marsh change and identified at-risk watersheds and salt marshes providing insight into the resilience and management of these ecosystems. The time series were filtered by cloud cover and the Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII). The combination of GEE enabled Landsat time series, and TMII filtering demonstrated a promising method for historic assessment and continued monitoring of salt marsh dynamics.

TI  - Dynamics of dissolved iron under pedohydrological regime caused by pulsed rainfall events in wetland soils
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of pedohydrological regime caused by pulsed rainfall events (PRE) on the dynamics of dissolved iron in wetland soil solutions was examined through in-situ sampling of three typical wetlands (perennial Carex lasiocarpa humus marsh, seasonal submerged Calamgrostis angustifolia meadow marsh, and seasonal dry paddy field) in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. The results showed that the dissolved iron of the upper soil layers (10 cm) of the three wetland soils corresponded to the pedohydrological regime to some extent, while the effect on the deeper layers (20-60 cm) was insignificant The Eh and pH response of the meadow marsh soil to PRE was much greater than the other two soils. Dissolved iron in the humus marsh soil showed more regularity than the other two soils. The negative significant correlations between Fe(II) and redox potential (Eh), Fe(III) and Eh, and Fe(III)/Fe(II) and pH were only observed in the humus marsh soil. As a redox indicator, Fe(III)/Fe(II) had a significantly positive correlation with Eh. Fe (II) was less correlated with Fe(III) than other chemical parameters during PRE. The total dissolved iron (Fe(II)+Fe(III)) had significantly positive correlation with total nitrogen (TN) in the humus marsh soil, while that of the meadow marsh soil had significantly positive correlation with TN, total phosphorus (TP), and total carbon (TC). These findings will be useful to better understand the environmental behavior of iron and their influencing factors, and provides an improved scientific basis for understanding the environmental fate of iron in wetland soils.

TI  - Deciphering the role of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the tolerance of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora to physicochemical properties of salt-marsh soils
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - A glasshouse experiment was conceived to assess the role of a bacterial consortium (Pseudomonas composti SDT3, Aeromonasaquariorum SDT 13 and Bacillus sp. SDT14) isolated from the rizhosphere of S. densiflora on its growth and physiological tolerance to the physicochemical properties of marsh soils.Two inoculation treatments (with and without inoculation) in combination with two soil types (from Piedras and Odiel marshes, SW Spain) were assigned for 50 days. Growth parameters, combined with measurements of gas exchange, efficiency of PSII biochemistry, photosynthetic pigments and leaf water content were measured. In addition, the accumulation of nutrients and trace elements were determined.The inoculation improved growth of S. densiflora through a beneficial effect on its photochemical apparatus due to its impact on chlorophyll concentration. This enhancement happened under both soil conditions and was mainly reflected in a greater length and diameter of roots. Also, inoculation favoured leaf water content through the decline in stomatal conductance and increment in root-to-shoot ratio. Moreover, this consortium was able to stimulate ion accumulation in roots and leaves.Selected rhizospheric bacteria appear to play a significant role in S. densiflora growth response and tolerance to the physicochemical properties of marshes soils.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP OF SOIL HYDROGEN-SULFIDE LEVEL TO NET CARBON ASSIMILATION OF PANICUM-HEMITOMON AND SPARTINA-PATENS
T2  - VEGETATIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Panicum hemitomon Schult and Spartina patens (Ait) Muhl. plants from Louisiana Gulf Coast fresh and brackish marshes were subjected to hydrogen sulfide under controlled sediment redox conditions. Net carbon assimilation responses of both species to the combined sediment anaerobiosis and hydrogen sulfide concentrations was measured. Panicum hemitomon was more sensitive to hydrogen sulfide as compared to Spartina patens. Initiation of reduction in net carbon assimilation in P. hemitomon began when H2S concentrations of soil solution exceeded 0.22 mg l-1. Reductions in net carbon assimilation in S. patens were also noted at H2S concentrations exceeding 0.34 mg l-1. The reduction in net carbon assimilation of both species measured at elevated H2S concentrations suggests that extreme anaerobiosis and elevated sulfide could contribute to the growth reduction of these species under certain conditions. However based on H2S concentration in fresh and brackish marsh soil profiles, levels were too low to cause any adverse effects of Panicum hemitomon. In brackish marsh soils containing hydrogen sulfide of 3.4 mg l-1 in soil solution, sulfide could be a major factor limiting growth of S. patens.

TI  - Plant Population Dynamics in a Degraded Coastal Wetland and Implications for the Carbon Cycle
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat destruction caused by human activities is threatening wetland plants. Based on Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Google Earth images, we analysed the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant populations in a degraded wetland in the Minjiang River Estuary from 2009 to 2019. Field survey records, tasselled cap transformation, and supervised classification were used for the image interpretation. The results indicate that the plant habitat area decreased by 42.1% over these 10 years. Consequently, the distribution area of each dominant species declined, and the proportion of total vegetated area in the habitat decreased from 53.1% to 32.6%. Moreover, the dominance relations of the species changed fromSpartina alterniflora > Phragmites australis > Cyperus malaccensis > Scirpus triquetertoP. australis > S. alterniflora > C. malaccensis > S. triqueter. We predict that the vegetation landscape in the wetland will be composed exclusively ofP. australisandS. alternifloraif habitat destruction continues. Finally, our research shows that the NPCS (net plant carbon sequestration) and PCS (plant carbon stock) in the wetland and the average values of methane flux, NPCS, PCS, and SOCS (sediment organic carbon stock) in the vegetated area have all decreased due to plant population declines.

TI  - Experimental evidence for rapid biotic and abiotic reduction of Fe (III) at low temperatures in salt marsh sediments: a possible mechanism for formation of modern sedimentary siderite concretions
T2  - SEDIMENTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fe (III) reduction is a key component of the global iron cycle, and an important control on carbon mineralization. However, little is known about the relative roles and rates of microbial (biotic) iron reduction, which utilizes organic matter, versus abiotic iron reduction, which occurs without carbon mineralization. This paper reports on the capacity for salt marsh sediments, which typically are rich in iron, to support abiotic reduction of mineral Fe (III) driven by oxidation of sulphide. Sediment was reacted with amorphous FeS under strictly anaerobic conditions at a range of temperatures in biotic and abiotic microcosm experiments. Fe (III) reduction driven by sulphide oxidation occurs abiotically at all temperatures, leading to Fe (II) and elemental sulphur production in all abiotic experiments. In biotic experiments elemental sulphur is also the oxidized sulphur product but higher bicarbonate production leads to FeCO3 precipitation. Abiotic reduction of Fe (III) occurs at rates that are significant compared with microbial Fe (III) reduction in salt marsh sediments. The solid phases produced by coupled abiotic and biotic reactions, namely elemental sulphur and FeCO3, are comparable to those seen in nature at Warham, Norfolk, UK. Furthermore, the rates of these processes measured in the microcosm experiments are sufficient to generate siderite concretions on the rapid time scales observed in the field. This work highlights the importance of abiotic Fe (III) reduction alongside heterotrophic reduction, which has implications for iron cycling and carbon mineralization in modern and ancient sediments.

TI  - Cattle grazing drives nitrogen and carbon cycling in a temperate salt marsh
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the impact of long-term cattle grazing on soil processes and microbial activity in a temperate salt marsh. Soil conditions, microbial biomass and respiration, mineralization and denitrification rates were measured in upper salt marsh that had been ungrazed or cattle grazed for several decades. Increased microbial biomass and soil respiration were observed in grazed marsh, most likely stimulated by enhanced rates of root turnover and root exudation. We found a significant positive effect of grazing on potential N mineralization rates measured in the laboratory, but this difference did not translate to in situ net mineralization measured monthly from May to September. Rates of denitrification were lowest in the grazed marsh and appeared to be limited by nitrate availability, possibly due to more anoxic conditions and lower rates of nitrification. The major effect of grazing on N cycling therefore appeared to be in limiting losses of N through denitrification, which may lead to enhanced nutrient availability to saltmarsh plants, but a reduced ability of the marsh to act as a buffer for land-derived nutrients to adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, we investigated if grazing influences the rates of turnover of labile and refractory C in saltmarsh soils by adding (14)C-labelled leaf litter or root exudates to soil samples and monitoring the evolution of (14)CO(2). Grazing had little effect on the rates of mineralization of (14)C used as a respiratory substrate, but a larger proportion of (14)C was partitioned into microbial biomass and immobilized in long- and medium-term storage pools in the grazed treatment. Grazing slowed down the turnover of the microbial biomass, which resulted in longer turnover times for both leaf litter and root exudates. Grazing may therefore affect the longevity of C in the soil and alter C storage and utilization pathways in the microbial community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Blue Carbon: an Additional Driver for Restoring and Preserving Ecological Services of Coastal Wetlands in Tampa Bay (Florida, USA)
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal habitats, including mangroves, salt marsh, and seagrass meadows, provide numerous ecosystem services, including improved water quality, shoreline stabilization, and essential fish habitat. Over the past few decades, the quantification of greenhouse gas fluxes in wetlands has improved, leading to the recognition of these habitats as long-term carbon sinks. Quantifying this "blue carbon" as an ecosystem service provides added value for wetland protection and restoration and serves as a useful management tool when implementing plans for sustained ecosystem health and productivity. Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), a highly urbanized estuary, provides an interesting case study to assess the role of blue carbon in supporting management and informing restoration decisions. This review provides results from the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment, which quantified existing carbon stocks and identified the future carbon sequestration trajectories of coastal habitats with respect to climate change and sea-level rise. Examples are provided of how these data can be used to prioritize restoration efforts, support and enhance management decisions, and potentially attract new partners to support wetland restoration projects that offer additional climate change mitigation and adaptation benefits. This added valuation can help drive investment towards additional wetland restoration activities to help meet management targets in estuaries worldwide.

TI  - Effects of Water Level and Salinity on TN and TP Contents in Marsh Soils of the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A field experiment was carried out at three different water levels and four salinity levels to study the effects of water level and salinity on nutrient contents in mash soil of the Yellow River Delta, China. Contents of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils were measured under different water and salinity levels during the study period. Results showed that TN contents gradually decreased with increasing salinities and the highest content appeared in surface soils in different sampling dates. Higher TN contents in August (361.55?mg/kg) and September (412.17?mg/kg) were observed under 0.52 and 16.7% salinity treatments, respectively, and 10?cm water level, and the highest value in October (504.81?mg/kg) was observed under 10.2% salinity treatment and 0?cm water level. TN contents showed significant differences among different water treatments. Similarly, TP content also appeared an accumulation in surface soils in each sampling date. However, significant differences of TP contents in subsurface soils were observed among three water levels. Salinity significantly influenced the changes in TN and TP contents in both soil layers under different water level treatments. Soil TN and TP contents were significantly correlated to soil organic matter.

TI  - Grazing mediates soil microbial activity and litter decomposition in salt marshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes contribute to climate change mitigation because of their great capacity to store organic matter (OM) in soils. Most of the research regarding OM turnover in salt marshes in times of global change focuses on effects of rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise, while effects of land-use change have gained little attention. The present work investigates the mechanisms by which livestock grazing can affect OM decomposition in salt marsh soils. In a grazing exclusion experiment at the mouth of the Yangtze estuary, China, we assessed soil microbial exo-enzyme activity (EEA) to gain insight into the microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) demand. Additionally, we studied the decomposition of plant litter in soil using the Tea Bag Index (TBI), a widely used standardized litter bag assay to fingerprint soil decomposition dynamics. Based on EEAs, grazing markedly reduced microbial C acquisition, whereas microbial N acquisition was strongly increased. These opposing grazing effects were also evident in the decomposition of standardized plant litter: The decomposition rate constant (k) and the stabilization (S) of litter were not inversely related, as would be expected, but instead both were reduced by livestock grazing. Our data suggest that gazing effects on EEAs and litter decomposition can just partly be explained by grazing-driven soil compaction and resulting lower oxygen availability, which has previously been hypothesized as a main pathway by which grazing can reduce microbial activity in wetland soils. Instead, grazing effects on microbial nutrient demand occurs to be an at least equally important control on soil decomposition processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mercury adsorption in the Mississippi River deltaic plain freshwater marsh soil of Louisiana Gulf coastal wetlands
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury adsorption characteristics of Mississippi River deltaic plain (MRDP) freshwater marsh soil in the Louisiana Gulf coast were evaluated under various conditions. Mercury adsorption was well described by pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacity of 39.8 mg g(-1). Additional fitting of intraparticle model showed that mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was controlled by both external surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion. The partition of adsorbed mercury (mg g-1) revealed that mercury was primarily adsorbed into organic-bond fraction (12.09) and soluble/exchangeable fraction (10.85), which accounted for 63.5% of the total adsorption, followed by manganese oxide-bound (7.50), easily mobilizable carbonate-bound (4.53), amorphous iron oxide-bound (0.55), crystalline Fe oxide-bound (0.41), and residual fraction (0.16). Mercury adsorption capacity was generally elevated along with increasing solution pH even though dominant species of mercury were non-ionic HgCl2, HgClOH and Hg(OH)(2) at between pH 3 and 9. In addition, increasing background NaCl concentration and the presence of humic acid decreased mercury adsorption, whereas the presence of phosphate, sulfate and nitrate enhanced mercury adsorption. Mercury adsorption in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was reduced by the presence of Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn with Pb showing the greatest competitive adsorption. Overall the adsorption capacity of mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was found to be significantly influenced by potential environmental changes, and such factors should be considered in order to manage the risks associated with mercury in this MRDP wetland for responding to future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Impact of Mississippi River freshwater reintroduction on enhancing marsh accretionary processes in a Louisiana estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To counteract extensive wetland loss a series of diversion projects have been implemented to introduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into Louisiana coastal wetlands. To keep pace with increases in water level due to subsidence Louisiana coastal marshes must vertically accrete through the accumulation of both organic matter and mineral sediment. The impact of Mississippi River freshwater diversion on enhancing vertical marsh accretion (mineral and organic matter accumulation) was examined in Breton Sound estuary, a coastal wetland experiencing marsh deterioration as result of subsidence and salt water intrusion. Using Cs-137 dating and artificial marker horizons, increases in the rate of vertical marsh accretion were measured at marsh sites along a spatial gradient which has been receiving diverted water from the Mississippi River (Caernarvon diversion) since 1991. Vertical accretion and accumulation of mineral sediment organic matter and nutrients in the marsh soil profile, increased at marsh sites receiving freshwater and sediment input. Iron and manganese content of the marsh surface sediment were shown to be an excellent signature of riverine sediment deposition. Soil extractable phosphorus was higher and extractable sodium was lower at sites nearest freshwater and sediment input. Results demonstrated that freshwater diversion through sediment input and lowering of salinity will enhance marsh accretion and stability, slowing or reversing the rate of wetland loss.

TI  - Sources and sinks of chloromethane in a salt marsh ecosystem: constraints from concentration and stable isotope measurements of laboratory incubation experiments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chloromethane (CH3Cl) is the most abundant long-lived chlorinated organic compound in the atmosphere and contributes significantly to natural stratospheric ozone depletion. Salt marsh ecosystems including halophyte plants are a known source of atmospheric CH3Cl but estimates of their total global source strength are highly uncertain and knowledge of the major production and consumption processes in the atmosphere-halophyte-soil system is yet incomplete. In this study we investigated the halophyte plant, Salicornia europaea, and soil samples from a coastal salt marsh site in Sardinia/Italy for their potential to emit and consume CH3Cl and using flux measurements, stable isotope techniques and Arrhenius plots differentiated between biotic and abiotic processes. Our laboratory approach clearly shows that at least 6 different production and consumption processes are active in controlling atmospheric CH3Cl fluxes of a salt marsh ecosystem. CH3Cl release by dried plant and soil material was substantially higher than that from the fresh material at temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 degrees C. Results of Arrhenius plots helped to distinguish between biotic and abiotic formation processes in plants and soils. Biotic CH3Cl consumption rates were highest at 30 degrees C for plants and 50 degrees C for soils, and microbial uptake was higher in soils with higher organic matter content. Stable isotope techniques helped to distinguish between formation and degradation processes and also provided a deeper insight into potential methyl moiety donor compounds, such as S-adenosyl-l-methionine, S-methylmethionine and pectin, that might be involved in the abiotic and biotic CH3Cl production processes. Our results clearly indicate that cycling of CH3Cl in salt marsh ecosystems is a result of several biotic and abiotic processes occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere-plant-soil system. Important precursor compounds for biotic and abiotic CH3Cl formation might be methionine derivatives and pectin. All formation and degradation processes are temperature dependent and thus environmental changes might affect the strength of each source and sink within salt marsh ecosystems and thus considerably alter total fluxes of CH3Cl from salt marsh ecosystems to the atmosphere.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Northeast United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide important ecological services, habitat, disturbance regulation, water quality improvement, and biodiversity, as well as accumulation and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in vegetation and soil organic matter. Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0-60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9 kg C/m(2) compared to 16.2 kg C/m(2) in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152 g/m(2)/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.

TI  - Inundation, Vegetation, and Sediment Effects on Litter Decomposition in Pacific Coast Tidal Marshes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cycling and sequestration of carbon are important ecosystem functions of estuarine wetlands that may be affected by climate change. We conducted experiments across a latitudinal and climate gradient of tidal marshes in the northeast Pacific to evaluate the effects of climate- and vegetation-related factors on litter decomposition. We manipulated tidal exposure and litter type in experimental mesocosms at two sites and used variation across marsh landscapes at seven sites to test for relationships between decomposition and marsh elevation, soil temperature, vegetation composition, litter quality, and sediment organic content. A greater than tenfold increase in manipulated tidal inundation resulted in small increases in decomposition of roots and rhizomes of two species, but no significant change in decay rates of shoots of three other species. In contrast, across the latitudinal gradient, decomposition rates of Salicornia pacifica litter were greater in high marsh than in low marsh. Rates were not correlated with sediment temperature or organic content, but were associated with plant assemblage structure including above-ground cover, species composition, and species richness. Decomposition rates also varied by litter type; at two sites in the Pacific Northwest, the grasses Deschampsia cespitosa and Distichlis spicata decomposed more slowly than the forb S. pacifica. Our data suggest that elevation gradients and vegetation structure in tidal marshes both affect rates of litter decay, potentially leading to complex spatial patterns in sediment carbon dynamics. Climate change may thus have direct effects on rates of decomposition through increased inundation from sea-level rise and indirect effects through changing plant community composition.

TI  - Multi-scale temporal variation of methane flux and its controls in a subtropical tidal salt marsh in eastern China
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - CH4 emissions could vary with biotic and abiotic factors at different time scales. However, little is known about temporal dynamics of CH4 flux and its controls in coastal marshes. In this study, CH4 flux was continuously measured with the eddy covariance technique for 2 years in a subtropical salt marsh in eastern China. Wavelet analysis was applied to explore the multi-scale variations of CH4 flux and its controls. Additionally, partial wavelet coherence was used to disentangle confounding effects of measured variables. No consistent diurnal pattern was found in CH4 fluxes. However, the hot-moments of CH4 flux were observed after nighttime high tide on days near the spring tide. Periodic dynamics were also observed at multi-day, semilunar and seasonal scales. Tide height in summer had a negative effect on CH4 flux at the semilunar scale. Air temperature explained most variations in CH4 fluxes at the multi-day scale but CH4 flux was mainly controlled by PAR and GEP at the seasonal scale. Air temperature explained 48% and 56% of annual variations in CH4 fluxes in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In total, the salt marsh acted as a CH4 source (17.6 +/- 3.0 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), which was higher than most studies report for inland wetlands. Our results show that CH4 fluxes exhibit multiple periodicities and its controls vary with time scale; moreover, CH4 flux is strongly modified by tide. This study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem-specific measurements of CH4 fluxes, and more work is needed to estimate regional CH4 budgets.

TI  - Salt marsh diking and restoration: Biogeochemical implications of altered wetland hydrology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In salt marshes, most biomass plus large reserves of biologically important N, P, Fe, and S are sequestered below ground under saline, waterlogged, and anaerobic conditions. Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.

TI  - Rethinking the Freshwater Eel: Salt Marsh Trophic Support of the American Eel, Anguilla rostrata
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact that Anguilla rostrata (American eel) are frequently captured in salt marshes, their role in salt marsh food webs and the influence of human impacts, such as tidal restrictions, on this role remains unclear. To better understand salt marsh trophic support of A. rostrata, eels were collected from tidally restricted and unrestricted salt marsh creeks within three New England estuaries. Gut contents were examined, and eel muscle tissue was analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and entered into MixSir mixing models to understand if salt marsh food sources are important contributors to eel diet. Data suggest that eel prey rely heavily on salt marsh organic matter and eels utilize salt marsh secondary production as an energetic resource over time, and thus can be considered salt marsh residents. Gut contents indicate that A. rostrata function as top predators, feeding primarily on secondary consumers including other fish species, crustaceans, and polychaetes. Higher A. rostrata trophic position measured upstream of reference creeks suggests that severe tidal restrictions may result in altered food webs, but it is not clear how this impacts the overall fitness of A. rostrata populations in New England salt marshes.

TI  - Effects of Crude Oil Contamination on Soil Physical and Chemical Properties in Momoge Wetland of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large oilfields are often coincidentally located in major river deltas and wetlands, and potentially damage the structure, function and ecosystem service values of wetlands during oil exploration. In the present study, the effects of crude oil contamination during oil exploration on soil physical and chemical properties were investigated in marshes of the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Jilin Province, China. The concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons in the marsh soil near the oil wells are significantly higher than those in the adjacent control marsh. Soil water contents in oil-contaminated marshes are negatively correlated with soil temperature and are significantly lower than those in the control area, especially in fall. Crude oil contamination significantly increases the soil pH up to 8.0, and reduces available phosphorus concentrations in the soil. The concentrations of total organic carbon are significantly different among sampling sites. Therefore, crude oil contamination could potentially alkalinize marsh soils, adversely affect soil fertility and physical properties, and cause deterioration of the marshes in the Momoge National Nature Reserve. Phyto-remediation by planting Calamagrostis angustifolia has the potential to simultaneously restore and remediate the petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated wetlands. Crude oil contamination affects the soil physical and chemical properties, so developing an effective restoration program in the Momoge wetland is neccesary.

TI  - The southeastern continental shelf of the United States as an atmospheric CO2 source and an exporter of inorganic carbon to the ocean
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The US southeastern continental shelf, also known as the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), is a strong source of CO, to the atmosphere, which is in direct contrast to recent reports regarding other major continental shelves. Both spatial (cross-shelf) and seasonal variations of the CO2 system were pronounced in the SAB. Sea surface pCO(2) in winter was undersaturated relative to the atmosphere, while oversaturation of pCO(2) dominated the entire shelf water in all other seasons. Annually, the SAB releases CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate of 30g Cm-2 (2.5 mol cm(-2)). This system also discharges dissolved inorganic carbon to the open ocean (30 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Methods of estimating CO2 flux and DIC flux are critically evaluated and compared. A carbon mass balance model in the SAB is presented based on inorganic carbon fluxes from this study and organic carbon fluxes from literature. The carbon budget is much closer to balance by using this carbon flux approach than by direct measurements of primary production and respiration. It is concluded that the SAB is a net heterotrophic system annually. Intensified hearing, elevated input of inorganic carbon from coastal salt marshes, microbial respiration of marsh-exported organic carbon and the lack of annual spring blooms all contribute to maintaining the SAB as a strong CO2 Source to the atmosphere during the warm seasons. In winter, the primary factor that governs the CO2 sink in the SAB is likely the cooling process. Strong heterotrophy during warm seasons also sustains the SAB to be an exporter of inorganic carbon to the open ocean annually. The SAB shelf functions differently from the East China Sea, the North Atlantic European Shelves, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. The SAB is classified as a "marsh-dominated" shelf as compared to other shelves in terms of carbon dynamics. Further work to study carbon dynamics in coastal margins is warranted to interpret their roles in the global CO, budget. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanistic strategies of microbial communities regulating lignocellulose deconstruction in a UK salt marsh
T2  - MICROBIOME
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSalt marshes are major natural repositories of sequestered organic carbon with high burial rates of organic matter, produced by highly productive native flora. Accumulated carbon predominantly exists as lignocellulose which is metabolised by communities of functionally diverse microbes. However, the organisms that orchestrate this process and the enzymatic mechanisms employed that regulate the accumulation, composition and permanence of this carbon stock are not yet known. We applied meta-exo-proteome proteomics and 16S rRNA gene profiling to study lignocellulose decomposition in situ within the surface level sediments of a natural established UK salt marsh.ResultsOur studies revealed a community dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Deltaproteobacteria that drive lignocellulose degradation in the salt marsh. We identify 42 families of lignocellulolytic bacteria of which the most active secretors of carbohydrate-active enzymes were observed to be Prolixibacteracea, Flavobacteriaceae, Cellvibrionaceae, Saccharospirillaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae and Cytophagaceae. These families secreted lignocellulose-active glycoside hydrolase (GH) family enzymes GH3, GH5, GH6, GH9, GH10, GH11, GH13 and GH43 that were associated with degrading Spartina biomass. While fungi were present, we did not detect a lignocellulolytic contribution from fungi which are major contributors to terrestrial lignocellulose deconstruction. Oxidative enzymes such as laccases, peroxidases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases that are important for lignocellulose degradation in the terrestrial environment were present but not abundant, while a notable abundance of putative esterases (such as carbohydrate esterase family 1) associated with decoupling lignin from polysaccharides in lignocellulose was observed.ConclusionsHere, we identify a diverse cohort of previously undefined bacteria that drive lignocellulose degradation in the surface sediments of the salt marsh environment and describe the enzymatic mechanisms they employ to facilitate this process. Our results increase the understanding of the microbial and molecular mechanisms that underpin carbon sequestration from lignocellulose within salt marsh surface sediments in situ and provide insights into the potential enzymatic mechanisms regulating the enrichment of polyphenolics in salt marsh sediments.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion in a seaward direction on variations of inorganic sulfur forms in marsh soils of the Minjiang River estuary, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion in a seaward direction on variations of inorganic sulfur forms in marsh soils, the levels of inorganic sulfur forms ( H2O-S, Adsorbed-S, HCl-Soluble-S and HCl-Volatile-S) were determined in bare flat ( BF, before invasion), S. alterniflora marsh after seaward invasion for one year ( SA') and S. alterniflora marsh after seaward invasion for three years ( SA) in Shanyutan of the Minjiang River estuary with the method of space-for-time substitution. Results showed that the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora altered the stocks and distribution of inorganic sulfur form in marsh soils. Compared with BF, the contents of H2O-S, Adsorbed-S and HCl-Volatile-S in soils of SA increased by 52.6%, 78.2% and 21.0%, respectively, while that of HCl-Soluble-S decreased by 3.4%. In contrast, the levels of H2O S, Adsorbed-S and HCl-Soluble-S in soils of SA' increased by 43.9%, 70.6% and 29.6%, respectively, whereas that of HCl-Volatile-S decreased by 11.6%. The contents of total inorganic sulfur ( TIS) in soils of SA and SA' increased by 40.7% and 37.8%, while the stocks of TIS increased by 26.8% and 31.4%, respectively. The key factors affecting different forms of inorganic sulfur in marsh soils had changed due to the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora. In particular, the key factors affecting the variations of H2O-S contents changed from soil grain composition and bulk density in BF to soil organic matter in SA' and SA. The seaward invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased the content of TIS in marsh soils, which was mainly contributed by H2O-S and Adsorbed-S. Thus, it was concluded that the seaward invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased the supply capacity of available sulfur in marsh soils, which, to some extent, accelerated its seaward invasion.

AB  - Adult female Culicoides occidentalis Wirth and Jones were collected in a coastal salt marsh habitat in southern California over a period of 15 mo Using CO2-baited suction traps. Adults were active year-round. Adult females overall were large based on wing length (1.86 mm). Because of coastal influences, daily and seasonal changes in air temperatures were greatly buffered, and mean temperatures ranged from 10 to 15degreesC in winter to 19-21degreesC in summer. Wing lengths varied inversely with air temperatures, with an average of 2.13 mm (February) to 1.6mm (July). Parity was consistently low (3.6% overall) and may reflect poor host availability in this isolated salt marsh habitat.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Fe and Mn Contents in the New-born Coastal Marshes in the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution characteristics of Fe and Mn contents in soils of nine different vegetation communities, located in the new-born marshes of the northern Yellow River estuary, were studied in May 2009. The results showed that the horizontal distributions of Fe and Mn contents showed an increasing tendency from Sparganiaceae-Potentilla supina marsh to bare flat. The vertical distribution characteristics of Fe and Mn contents in different marsh soils fluctuated significantly with the vegetation succession. The soil parent materials determined the Fe, Mn contents in the new-born marshes, and seawater, vegetations and soil fine particle also had important influences on their contents. Further analysis showed that Fe contents had significant positive correlation with Mn contents (P <0. 01). Fe, Mn contents also showed significant correlations with silt, clay, TN, NO3--N and organic matter (P <0. 05), indicating that Fe and Mn had close relationships with nitrogen, and the contents of soil fine particles and organic matter were the dominant factors affecting the distribution of Fe and Mn in soils. In addition, the Fe contents ranged from 16.49 g.kg(-1) to 33. 11 g.kg(-1) and the average was 22. 54 g.kg(-1), which was close to the Fe contents in the tidal marshes of north Jiangsu, the Loess Plateau and the China soil background value, but slightly lower than those in the marshes of the Yangtse River estuary, the mangrove swamps and inland lake wetland. The Mn contents ranged from 305. 87 mg.kg(-1) to 711. 39 mg.kg(-1) and the average was 451.09 mg.kg(-1), which was lower than the Mn contents in the Loess Plateau and the China soil background value.

TI  - Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching in meadow marsh soil and related affecting factors
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an incubation test with soil columns was carried out for 35 days to study the dynamics of DOC leaching from the organic layers (2 similar to 13 cm) of two meadow marsh soils, and the correlation of DOC release with soil respiration, NH4+ formation, and leachate pH. The results showed that in the first week, DOC release presented a fast decrease, and then held on a steady level, which could be well described by one order exponential equation (R-2 > 0.96, P < 0.05). During 35 days incubation, the cumulative release of DOC from two test soils was 210.9 mu g C.g(-1) and 506.58 mu g C.g(-1), and the cumulative emission of CO2 was 679.64 mu g C.g(-1) and 455.54 mu g C.g(-1), respectively. It was suggested that in the course of incubation, the lower DOC release might be related to the microbial carbon limitation because of the greater CO2 production rate. A significantly positive correlation was found between DOC release and NH4+ formation (r(XI) = 0.886, P < 0.05; r(XII) = 0.972, P < 0.01), while no significant correlation was observed between DOC release and leachate pH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the nitrogen mineralization potential of meadow marsh soil was the main factor affecting DOC production.

TI  - Salt Marsh Bacterial Communities before and after the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico shoreline received varied types and amounts of weathered oil residues after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.

TI  - Effects of Temperature and Water Saturation on CO2 Production and Nitrogen Mineralization in Alpine Wetland Soils
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Relationships between carbon (C) production and nitrogen (N) mineralization were investigated in two alpine wetland soils of the Tibetan Plateau using laboratory incubation under different temperatures (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and water saturation (noninundation and inundation). A significant positive relationship was found between CO2 production and N mineralization under increasing temperatures from 5 to 35 degrees C with the same water saturation condition in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.491 P < 0.0001) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.38, P < 0.002), and a negative relationship with water saturation increasing at the same temperature, especially 25 and 35 degrees C, in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.70, P < 0.009) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.61: P < 0.013). In conclusion, temperatures and water saturation could regulate the relationship between CO2 production and net N mineralization in the Tibetan alpine marsh and peat soils.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes of temperate urban wetlands with different restoration history
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of tidal brackish wetlands and how they may be affected by restoration methods are largely unknown. The New Jersey Meadowlands, a tidal brackish estuary system, have had a long history of pollution, hydrological alterations, multiple restoration and mitigation treatments since the early 1970ies. To understand the effects of restoration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in three urban tidal brackish wetland sites over three years: an organic matter amended restored site, a non-amended restored site and a natural (non-restored) wetland site. Our results showed all three sites to be a CO2 source in the wintertime reverting to a weak sink of CO2 in the summer and annually to be sources of CO2 for some of the sites for some of the time. However, the amended restored wetland was found to have the highest release of CO2. Annual destructive harvest of the major species at these wetlands (Spartina ssp and Phragmites australis) did not show significant differences in the aboveground net primary productivity and leaf area over the course of this study. Overall, aboveground biomass production of the three wetlands sites was within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes, but the sites differed in their NEE, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production. This investigation suggests that CO2 uptake and potential subsequent carbon sequestration may be strongly affected by the management and restoration history of the wetlands, and in our case these wetlands are often acting as a source of CO2, and not as a sink, as may have been expected.

AB  - We periodically measured soil properties (bulk density, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) in a tidal salt marsh constructed in 1970 over the past five decades (1984, 1995, 1998, 2017) to identify trajectories of soil formation over time. Bulk density was greater in surface (0-10 cm) than subsurface (10-30 cm) soils and decreased with time at a similar rate in both depths. Percent organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) increased with time, with concentrations in surface soils increasing three times faster than subsurface soils. Surface C and N pools (g/m(2), 0-10 cm) exhibited asymptotic trajectories with time, with rapid accumulation in the first two decades that began to equilibrate after 25 years, while subsurface pools of C and N continued to increase in a linear manner. Soil P pools did not exhibit a significant trend related to marsh age. Soil N: P increased in both depths over time, suggesting gradual relaxation of N-limitation of these systems. Our findings can help restoration ecologists identify soil properties, including bulk density, C, N, and C: N suitable for gauging restoration success and better estimate the time frame necessary for recovery of soil-based ecosystem services.

TI  - Spatially-dependent patterns of plant recovery and sediment accretion following multiple disturbances in a Gulf Coast tidal marsh
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are projected to experience increases in anthropogenic and climatic disturbances, which may alter plant-sediment feedbacks critical for maintaining marsh resilience to sea level. To study the effects of disturbance on ecogeomorphic processes, we examined aboveground plant responses and sediment accretion in three locations relative to the shoreline (low, mid, and high) within a tidal marsh at Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. This study site was affected by two hurricanes in the fall of 2008, and subsequently burned as part of a controlled experiment in January 2009, permitting examination of the effects of two disturbance types on aboveground plant responses and vertical accretion. Fire and hurricanes affected these response variables differently, with effects dependent on location within the marsh. Fire significantly reduced standing aboveground biomass, and subsequent recovery of vegetation relative to pre-burn levels was faster in low marsh plots nearest to the shore than in high marsh plots closest to the marsh-pine ecotone. Hurricanes introduced sediment to the marsh platform, resulting in greater accretion in low marsh plots that had more standing biomass and higher stem densities than high marsh plots. Collectively, these results demonstrate that disturbances can heterogeneously affect surface soil-building processes in marshes through effects on sediment and organic matter accumulation, which may have important consequences for surface elevation maintenance in coastal marshes.

T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

AB  - In transgressive coastal areas, marshes form in response to sea-level rise and they generally represent an ideal environment for the sequestration of S species. Various predictions in rates of sea-level rise associated with global warming and concern for potential environmental problems from acid-sulfate weathering have prompted interest in modeling rates of S sequestration during coastal marsh pedogenesis. In this study, predictive models were derived for organic and pyrite S using data from pedons along two marsh transects in Dorchester County, MD, Organic S accumulates mainly in the organic horizons, and the rate is mainly driven by sea-level rise. Rates of organic S accumulation for the last 150 yr averaged 4.3 +/- 1.19 g m(-2) yr(-1); before this, long-term rates ranged between 0.95 and 2.05 g m(-2) yr(-1). Pyrite S sequestration reflects accumulations both in organic horizons and in the submerged mineral soil. The rate of pyrite sequestration in organic horizons is generally driven by sea-level rise and the availability of reactive Fe. During the last 150 Jr, the rates of pyrite accumulation averaged 7.2 +/- 1.6 g m(-2) yr(-1); before this, long-term rates ranged between 0.53 and 1.14 g m(-2) yr(-1). Modeled predictions of pyrite and organic S accumulations in newly forming marshes during the next century were 15 +/- 4.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 19 +/- 8.2 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively.

AB  - Analyses of three sediment cores collected from a tidal salt marsh located On the western edge of San Pablo Bay in the San Francisco Bay estuary have produced long-term records of late Holocene marsh development. The records from these cores include a suite of elements, organic carbon content, fossil seeds, pollen, and stable carbon isotopes. The stratigraphy indicates fresher water conditions than present between 3400 and 2000 cal YBP. A tidal marsh became established at China Camp after about 2000 cal YBP: between 2000 cal YBP and approximately 700 cal YBP, conditions in the estuary were apparently more saline and variable. This interval was terminated by at least three or possibly five flood events, as evidenced by coarse elastic materials most likely washed down from the surrounding uplands. These floods represent high rainfall events, possibly El Nino years, and occurred during the late Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Greater plant diversity and pollen from some species with low salt tolerance are found in a core collected near the upland edge of the marsh and date to about 200 years ago, suggesting fresher conditions than today. Over the past 50 years, the diversity of marsh vegetation has decreased, and salt tolerant plants (especially Salicornia virginica) have become the dominant species. These changes are likely a result of the impacts of water diversions and upstream dams in the San Francisco Bay watershed.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland stores substantial amount of carbon and may contribute greatly to global climate change debate. However, few researches have focused on the effects of global climate change on carbon mineralization in Zoig alpine wetland, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the most important peatlands in China. Through incubation experiment, this paper studied the effects of temperature, soil moisture, soil type (marsh soil and peat soil) and their interactions on CO2 and CH4 emission rates in Zoig alpine wetland. Results show that when the temperature rises from 5A degrees C to 35A degrees C, CO2 emission rates increase by 3.3-3.7 times and 2.4-2.6 times under non-inundation treatment, and by 2.2-2.3 times and 4.1-4.3 times under inundation treatment in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively. Compared with non-inundation treatment, CO2 emission rates decrease by 6%-44%, 20%-60% in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively, under inundation treatment. CO2 emission rate is significantly affected by the combined effects of the temperature and soil type (p < 0.001), and soil moisture and soil type (p < 0.001), and CH4 emission rate was significantly affected by the interaction of the temperature and soil moisture (p < 0.001). Q (10) values for CO2 emission rate are higher at the range of 5A degrees C-25A degrees C than 25A degrees C-35A degrees C, indicating that carbon mineralization is more sensitive at low temperature in Zoig alpine wetland.

TI  - Plant biomass and rates of carbon dioxide uptake are enhanced by successful restoration of tidal connectivity in salt marshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes, due to their capability to bury soil carbon (C), are potentially important regional C sinks. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades in New England (USA), as well as in some other parts of the world. In this study, we investigated plant biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at four sites where restoration of tidal flow occurred five to ten years prior to the study. Site elevation, aboveground biomass, CO2 flux, and porewater chemistry were measured in 2015 and 2016 in both restored marshes and adjacent marshes where tidal flow had never been restricted. We found that the elevation in restored marsh sites was 2-16 cm lower than their natural references. Restored marshes where porewater chemistry was similar to the natural reference had greater plant aboveground biomass, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, as well as net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) than the natural reference, even though they had the same plant species. We also compared respiration rates in aboveground biomass (AR) and soil ( BR) during July 2016, and found that restored marshes had higher AR and BR fluxes than natural references. Our findings indicated that well-restored salt marshes can result in greater plant biomass and NEP, which has the potential to enhance rates of C sequestration at 10-yrs post restoration. Those differences were likely due to lower elevation and greater flooding frequency in the recently restored marshes than the natural marsh. The inverse relationship between elevation and productivity further suggests that, where sea-level rise rate does not surpass the threshold of plant survival, the restoration of these salt marshes may lead to enhanced organic and mineral sedimentation, extending marsh survival under increased sea level, and recouping carbon stocks that were lost during decades of tidal restriction.

TI  - Accuracy and Precision of Tidal Wetland Soil Carbon Mapping in the Conterminous United States
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands produce long-term soil organic carbon (C) stocks. Thus for carbon accounting purposes, we need accurate and precise information on the magnitude and spatial distribution of those stocks. We assembled and analyzed an unprecedented soil core dataset, and tested three strategies for mapping carbon stocks: applying the average value from the synthesis to mapped tidal wetlands, applying models fit using empirical data and applied using soil, vegetation and salinity maps, and relying on independently generated soil carbon maps. Soil carbon stocks were far lower on average and varied less spatially and with depth than stocks calculated from available soils maps. Further, variation in carbon density was not well-predicted based on climate, salinity, vegetation, or soil classes. Instead, the assembled dataset showed that carbon density across the conterminous united states (CON US) was normally distributed, with a predictable range of observations. We identified the simplest strategy, applying mean carbon density (27.0 kg C m -3 ), as the best performing strategy, and conservatively estimated that the top meter of CONUS tidal wetland soil contains 0.72 petagrams C. This strategy could provide standardization in CONUS tidal carbon accounting until such a time as modeling and mapping advancements can quantitatively improve accuracy and precision.

TI  - Soil-Aggregate-Associated Organic Carbon Along Vegetation Zones in Tidal Salt Marshes in the Liaohe Delta
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the tidal salt marshes, the spatial variation of soil carbon (C) quality along the vegetation zones is still unclear. Here, a study is conducted in the mudflat, open shrubland, and dense shrubland in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, and soil organic C (OC) stock, particulate organic matter C (POMC), and aggregate-associated OC in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths are investigated along these vegetation zones. Among the three vegetation zones, dense shrubland had the greatest soil OC stock, open shrubland had the lowest value, and mudflat had an intermediate value. In each soil depth, dense shrubland generally had higher soil OC and POMC concentrations, and POMC/OC ratio compared to mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. Moreover, dense shrubland had a greater proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) and OC content in the macro-aggregates than mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. In addition, the OC content in the soil macro-aggregates positively correlated with soil POMC concentration. These results suggest that the high spatial variability in soil OC quantity and quality along the vegetation zones should be incorporated to accurately develop regional C budget in coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, and also imply that a shift in vegetation zones induced by sea level rise could potentially cause substantial changes in the quantity and quality of soil OC in the tidal salt marshes.

TI  - Bacterial community composition in soils covered by different vegetation types in the Yancheng tidal marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation plays an important role in maintaining ecological function and is a key factor affecting the soil bacterial community. Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Yancheng tidal marsh to stabilize the sediments and gradually replaced the native plants. However, the changes in the soil bacterial community profile caused by S. alterniflora invasion are poorly characterized. Here, we used MiSeq sequencing to compare the composition of the bacterial community in soil at different depths under exotic S. alterniflora (SA), native Phragmites australis (PA), and native Suaeda salsa (SS). The results showed that the pH value was lower, but the salinity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and number of 16S rRNA genes were higher in SA soils than in PA and SS soils. Overall, Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae. Anaerolineae in the Chloroflexi phylum showed the greatest difference based on vegetation, accounting for 14.4% of the overall bacterial community in SA soils but only about 3.8% of those in PA and SS soils. The composition, interaction, and predicted functional profiles of the bacterial community in SA soils were significantly different from those in PA and SS soils, especially for functions related to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Salinity was negatively correlated with the Shannon index and accounted for 37.7% of the total variation in the bacterial community, making it the most important environmental factor. Our results showed the differences in bacterial community composition among different vegetation types and soil depths in the Yancheng tidal marsh, which provides a microbial basis for a better understanding of the ecological functions in this ecosystem.

TI  - Co-development of wetland soils and benthic invertebrate communities following salt marsh creation
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of wetland soil characteristics and benthic invertebrate communities were evaluated in created Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in North Carolina ranging in age from 1 to 25 years-old. A combination of measurements from different-age created marshes as well as periodic measurements over time on two marshes were used to (1) document rates of wetland pedogenesis, especially soil organic matter, and, (2) explore relationships between soil and benthic invertebrate community development. Soil macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat), organic C and N increased and bulk density decreased during the 25 years following marsh establishment. The most dramatic changes in bulk density, MOM, C and N occurred within the upper 10 cm of the soil with lesser changes below this depth. Created marshes were sinks for organic C (90-140 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) and N (7-11 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1) but not for P (0-1 gcntdotm-2cntdotyr-1). The density of benthic invertebrates (>250 mum) and subsurface-deposit feeding oligochaetes also increased over time on created salt marshes. Invertebrate and oligochaete density were strongly related to MOM content (r2 = 0.83-0.87) and soil organic C (r2 = 0.52-0.82) and N (r2 = 0.62-0.84). These findings suggest that, in created salt marshes, development of the benthic invertebrate community is tied to marsh soil formation, especially accumulation of organic matter as MOM and soil. Field studies that manipulate the quantity and quality of soil organic matter are needed to elucidate the relationship between salt marsh pedogenesis and benthic invertebrate community development.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are known as organic matter producers. The goal of this work is to study tiller demography, standing biomass, and net aerial primary productivity (NAPP) in a Spartina densiflora coastal wetland, using a method applied to permanent sample plots located at two sites differing in topographic location, a regularly flooded zone [relative low marsh (LM)] and an irregularly flooded one [relative high marsh (HM)]. Measurements were made every 2 months during the 2005-2007 period. The annual NAPP was estimated to be 2,599 +/- 705 gDW m(-2) year(-1) for the HM and 2,181 +/- 605 gDW m(-2) year(-1) and 602 +/- 154 gDW m(-2) year(-1) for the first and second period of the LM populations, respectively, showing a seasonal pattern reaching maximum values in summer. The reduced NAPP values of the LM sites in the second year was associated with an extremely high precipitation period related to the 2007-2008 El Nio event.

TI  - Impacts of land management practices on blue carbon stocks and greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal ecosystems-A meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global recognition of climate change and its predicted consequences has created the need for practical management strategies for increasing the ability of natural ecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon. Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.

TI  - Iron biogeochemistry in Holocene palaeo and actual salt marshes in coastal areas of the Pampean Plain, Argentina
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In salt marshes, the hydrodynamics and the availability of iron, organic matter and sulphate, influence the formation and/or dissolution of iron sulfides and iron oxyhydroxides. Therefore, they constitute key factors affecting the iron biogeochemical processes in these environments. The aim of this work is to evaluate the physicochemical and mineralogical variations associated to iron biogeochemistry in palaeo and actual salt marshes in the area of influence of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Pampean Plain, Argentina. In soils of exhumed palaeo marshes, the iron contents are 56-95 mu mol g(-1), whereas these contents decrease to 36-75 mu mol g(-1) in actual marsh soils. The presence of framboidal and poliframboidal pyrites associated with gypsum, barite, calcite, halite and iron oxyhydroxides defines the conditions of the pedosedimentary sequences of the Holocene paleomarshes. Sequences of pyrite formation (sulfidization) and degradation (sulfuricization) were observed. These processes were evidenced by a sequential extraction, reflecting that the largest proportion of iron is in the form of crystalline iron oxides (28-76 %) and lepidocrocite (6-16 %); while the proportion associated with ferrihydrite and pyrite is low (0-9 and 1-17 %, respectively). These facts could be partly explained by the complex redox processes characteristic of these environments, such as aeration generated by the rhizosphere and intense bioturbation by invertebrates. These iron biomineralizations have been useful because they allow paleoenvironmental interpretations and characterization of paleomarshes, and environmental inferences related to the management of actual salt marshes.

TI  - Use of Random Forest Model to Identify the Relationships among Vegetative Species, Salt Marsh Soil Properties, and Interstitial Water along the Atlantic Coast of Georgia
T2  - INFRASTRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes, known to be ecologically sensitive areas, face disturbances such as vegetation dieback due to anthropogenic activities such as construction. The current construction specifications recommended by state highway agencies do not specifically require documenting or restoring any prior saltmarsh soil/interstitial water properties, nor do they require re-establishing saltmarsh vegetation; restoring the abiotic properties and appropriate vegetation would enhance the long-term functionality and ecology of a disturbed area. In order to have a successful restoration of disturbed saltmarshes with healthy vegetation, the relationship between vegetative species and the properties of saltmarsh soils and interstitial water must be fully understood. In this study, field and laboratory tests were conducted for the soil samples from eight different saltmarsh sites in the Southeastern US Atlantic coastal region, followed by the development of a random forest model; the aim is to identify correlation among saltmarsh predominant vegetation types, redox potential, and salinity. The results reveal that moisture content and sand content are two main drivers for the bulk density of saltmarsh soils, which directly affect plant growth and likely root development. Moreover, it is concluded that deploying modern machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, can help to identify desirable saltmarsh soil/water properties for re-establishing vegetative cover with the reduced time after construction activities.

The ability to endure the toxic effect of the sulphidic materials is the factor that best explain Spartina maritima distribution at Ortigueira. None of the other factors considered seem to be determinant on. that distribution. Electric conductivity, cation (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) and chloride concentration have a wide range, overlapped with those from other salt-marsh vegetation communities.

TI  - SOIL EVOLUTION ALONG A FOREST SALT-MARSH TRANSECT UNDER A REGIME OF SLOWLY RISING SEA-LEVEL, SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil evolution in salt marshes at North Inlet, SC, is driven by slowly rising sea level (3.4 mm/yr). As sea level rises the boundary between the low-lying coastal forest and high marsh moves up slope. As sandy forested Spodosols become subject to tidal inundation and salinization, forest vegetation (Pinus, Quercus, Nyssa, Lagerstroemia, and Vaccinium) is replaced successively by Cedrus, Iva, Juncus, Borrichia, Salicornia, short-form Spartina, and finally medium Spartina. These botanical changes accompany gradual changes in soil texture, chemistry and morphology. The originally sandy textured A and E horizons of the Spodosol become progressively enriched in clay and silt by tidal deposition of marine mud. These fine grained deposits do not form a distinct geogenetic layer but rather are mixed downward into the original sandy horizons by intense fiddler crab (Uca) burrowing. Thus soils in the marsh become gradually more sandy with depth. The strong color contrast between the original A and E horizons is eventually obliterated by mud enrichment and the growth of a dense Spartina root mat, leaving a medium gray A horizon that is difficult to sub-divide. In addition, the decay of organic matter in the marsh soils via sulfate reduction results in increased soil sulfur with distance into the marsh.The sandy, black spodic horizon originally formed in the forest environment occurs beneath the marsh surface at depths of less than 1 m and to distances of several hundred meters from the forest-marsh boundary. Except perhaps for its upper 10 cm, the spodic B horizon appears to have been little affected by marsh processes. The presence of the spodic horizon in the marsh profile, and the fact that it is not buried beneath a sufficiently thick and distinct geologic deposit, poses an interesting taxonomic problem. Based on their moisture regime, sulfur content, and spodic horizons, the marsh soils are best classified as Sulfaquentic Haplaquods. However, the spodic horizon, which is diagnostic for this classification, is clearly relict in terms of the processes that are thought to be responsible for its formation.

TI  - Nitrogen removal through N cycling from sediments in a constructed coastal marsh as assessed by N-15-isotope dilution
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - \ Constructed coastal marsh regulates land-born nitrogen (N) loadings through salinity-dependent microbial N transformation processes. A hypothesis that salinity predominantly controls N removal in marsh was tested through incubation in a closed system with added-(NH4+)-N-15 using sediments collected from five sub-marshes in Shihwa marsh, Korea. Time-course patterns of concentrations and N-15-atom% of soil-N pools were analyzed. Sediments having higher salinity and lower soil organic-C and acid-extractable organic-N exhibited slower rates of N mineralization and immobilization, nitrification, and denitrification. Rates of denitrification were not predicted well by sediment salinity but by its organic-C, indicating heterotrophic denitrification. Denitrification dominated N-loss from this marsh, and nitrogen removal capacity of this marsh was estimated at 337 kg N day(-1) (9.9% of the daily N-loadings) considering the current rooting depth of common reeds (1.0 m). We showed that sediment N removal decreases with increasing salinity and can increase with increasing organic-C for heterotrophic denitrification.

TI  - Sediment Accumulation, Elevation Change, and the Vulnerability of Tidal Marshes in the Delaware Estuary and Barnegat Bay to Accelerated Sea Level Rise
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tidal marshes are highly valued habitats, yet are vulnerable to loss from both anthropogenic and natural disturbances including sea-level rise (SLR). Many tidal marshes have kept pace with SLR over the last century; on average, however, recent escalations in SLR increase the vulnerability of marshes to submergence. Relative sea-level rise near our study sites in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. averaged 4.34 mm year(-1) over the last 50 years, yet over the last 19 years, relative sea-level rise averaged 6.25 mm year(-1) and the rise in high tide water levels averaged 8.13 mm year(-1). We compared these rates of water rise to rates of marsh surface elevation change using surface elevation tables in ten tidal marshes-three tidal freshwater and four saline marshes in the Delaware Estuary and three salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, NJ, USA. We also examined the effects of marsh type and geomorphic setting on rates of elevation change, surface accretion, and subsurface change as well as the influence of marsh elevation, distance from a channel, and tidal range (n = 3 sites per marsh). Surface elevation change measured over the last 4 to 9 years averaged less than 6 mm year(-1) in nine out of ten of the study stations, less than rates of relative SLR. Tidal freshwater marshes in the Delaware Estuary had greater rates of surface accretion and elevation change than salt marshes in Barnegat Bay. Marshes sitting lower in the tidal frame and experiencing higher tidal ranges tended to have higher surface accretion rates, but shallow subsidence had a stronger influence on these elevation change rates. We estimated time to submergence (i.e., lifespan) for using rates of marsh elevation change, a SLR rate of 10 mm year(-1), and thresholds for conversion to open water using geospatial datasets. The calculated time to submergence for the majority of marshes was 60 to 80 years with some predicted to submerge in as few as 5 years. These data suggest that in order to keep pace with accelerating SLR, surface accretion in many of these marshes will have to increase at a rate that surpasses shallow subsidence (1-7 mm year(-1)).

T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are widely distributed in the northeast of China, serving as source, sink or transfer of most chemical matter. Owing to worse natural environment such as drought, water shortage and intense human activities, inland salt marshes were extensively developed in the west Songhuajiang-Nenjiang plain with high ecological frangibility, in which Xianghai wetland is one typical inland salt marsh located downstream of Huolin river basin, Jilin Province of China. Soil samples were collected in Xianghai wetland during four months ( May, July, September and October) in 2001. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), soil pH and soil particle sizes were measured in wetland soils in order to study influencing factors and seasonal dynamics of the life elements in soil profiles from inland salt marsh. Correlation analysis was carried out to show the relationships between SOC, TN, TP, soil pH, clay, silt and sand. Results showed that SOC, TN and TP contents were significantly negatively correlated with depth, and decreased from surface soils down to bottom soil layers in four months; the obvious seasonal dynamics of SOC, TN and TP contents in soil profiles were also observed and the seasonal dynamics of life elements in soil profiles generally showed the consistent changing trends of "increasing after decreasing" with the exception of continuous increase of SOC and TN contents in surface soils, There were significantly negative correlations between SOC, TN and TP, which were greatly influenced by soil clay, silt and sand contents; soil pH was significantly negatively correlated with SOC content, but weakly influenced TN and TP contents. Since soil nutrient contents are important determining factors of soil fertility, changes of which greatly influence productivity of wetland ecosystem, which can provide scientific basis for further studies of evolvement of soil quality. ecological restoration and sustainable management of wetlands in this region.

TI  - Sediment manganese and biogenic silica as geochemical indicators in estuarine salt marshes of coastal Georgia, USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt-marsh estuarine sediments are not homogeneous. It is obvious that a steady state cannot be assumed if the depositional environments under which salt marshes accumulate change from subtidal through non-vegetated intertidal to vegetated intertidal state during their formation. In addition to these, the supply of sedimentary material depends on the tidal prism which changes as salt marshes are formed. Based on the study of cores collected in the estuarine region of Georgia, USA, it was found that the Mn/Al ratios in sediments of marsh cores change from subtidal through non-vegetated intertidal to vegetated intertidal. The relative variation of biogenic silica preserved in sediments of marsh core reflects the relative supply rate of organic carbon (phytoplankton) produced in the water column to the sediment surface at the time of deposition. In this paper it is proposed that sediment manganese and biogenic silica may be applied as geochemical indicators of changing depositional environments and organic carbon originating from phytoplankton in the estuarine salt marsh sediments.

T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes represent an important transitional zone between uplands and estuaries. One important function of marshes is to assimilate nutrient inputs from uplands, thus providing a buffer for anthropogenic nutrient loads. We examined the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization on biogeochemical and microbial processes during the summer growing season in a Spartina patens (Aiton (Muhl.)) marsh in the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve on Prudence Island (RI). Quadruplicate 1 m(2) plots were fertilized with N and P additions, N-only, P-only, or no additions. N-only addition significantly stimulated bacterial production and increased pore water NH4+ and NO(3)(-)concentrations. Denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 8 mmol m(-2) day(-1). Fertilization had no apparent effect on soil oxygen consumption or denitrification measured in the summer in intact cores due to high core-to-core variation. P fertilization led to increased pore water dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations and increased DIP release from soils. In contrast the control and N-only treatments had significant DIP uptake across the soil-water interface. The results suggest that in the summer fertilization has no apparent effect on denitrification rates, stimulates bacterial productivity, enhances pore water nutrient concentrations and alters some nutrient fluxes across the marsh surface.

TI  - The Functions and Values of Fringing Salt Marshes in Northern New England, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the functions and values of fringing salt marshes to those of meadow marshes along the southern Maine/New Hampshire coast. Differences included soil organic matter content, plant species richness, and percent cover of high and low-marsh species. More sediment was trapped per unit area in fringing marshes than in meadow marshes, but this difference was not significant. Similarities included aboveground and belowground peak season biomass and the ability to dampen wave energy. Both marsh types reduced the height of waves coming onto the marsh surface by 63% only 7 m into the marsh. Fringing marshes are diverse in terms of their physical characteristics (width, length, slope, elevation, soils). Despite their small size, they are valuable components of estuaries, performing many ecological functions to the same degree as nearby meadow marshes. More effort should be made to include them in regional efforts to conserve and restore coastal habitats.

TI  - Coastal blue carbon: Concept, study method, and the application to ecological restoration
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal blue carbon refers to the carbon taken from atmospheric CO2; fixed by advanced plants (including salt marsh, mangrove, and seagrass), phytoplankton, macroalgae, and marine calcifiers via the interaction of plants and microbes; and stored in nearshore sediments and soils; as well as the carbon transported from the coast to the ocean and ocean floor. The carbon sequestration capacity per unit area of coastal blue carbon is far greater than that of the terrestrial carbon pool. The mechanisms and controls of the carbon sink from salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, the aquaculture of shellfish and macroalgae, and the microbial carbon pump need to be further studied. The methods to quantify coastal blue carbon include carbon flux measurements, carbon pool measurements, manipulative experiments, and modeling. Restoring, conserving, and enhancing blue carbon will increase carbon sinks and produce carbon credits, which could be traded on the carbon market. The need to tackle climate change and implement China's commitment to cut carbon emissions requires us to improve studies on coastal blue carbon science and policy. The knowledge learned from coastal blue carbon improves the conservation and restoration of salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses; enhances the function of the microbial carbon pump; and promotes sustainable aquaculture, such as ocean ranching.

TI  - Modeling of Sea-Level Rise and Deforestation in Submerging Coastal Ultisols of Chesapeake Bay
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and the predicted adverse environmental implications in coastal areas haw prompted the use of a quantitative pedological approach to model the history of relative sea-level rise and the subsequent lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) during the pedogenic transformation of Ultisols (forest soils) to Histosols (marsh soils). The modeling was based on the transgressing soil-landscape concept and data collected from sampling units along two marsh transects in Dorchester County, Maryland. In low-relief submerging environments, coastal marshes accrete vertically and migrate laterally over adjacent Ultisols to keep pace with sea-level rise. The marsh substrate is organic in nature overlying what once were upland forest soils. The history of relative sea-level rise was a two-step linear function illustrating acceleration in the last two centuries. During the last 150 yr, the Pb-210-based rare of relative sea-level rise averaged 2.4 +/- 0.7 min yr(-1). Before the last few hundred years, the long-term C-14-based rate of relative sea-level rise was 0.82 +/- 0.15 mm yr(-1). The race of lateral migration of coastal marshes (deforestation) showed similar acceleration following the history of relative sea-level rise. During the last 150 yr, the average rate of lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) ranged from 3.51 +/- 2.0 to 6.78 +/- 7.4 m yr(-1). Before the last 150 yr, the average long-term rate of lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) ranged between 0.18 +/- 0.07 and 1.27 +/- 1.2 m yr(-1). Within a given region where sea-level rise and tidal range remain constant, the rate of lateral migration of marshes is a function of site characteristics and the slope of the adjacent uplands. The predicted rate of lateral migration of marshes in the next century ranges from 3.2 to 33 in yr(-1), averaging 14 +/- 11 in yr(-1). Assuming that the present rate of relative sea-level rise remains constant, the time needed to complete the pedogenic transformation of Ultisols to Histosols is 180 +/- 35 yr. The most conservative future scenario of sea-level rise has reduced this time by 63%. The projected sequestration of C, total N, and pyrite in the newly formed coastal marshes during the next 100 yr average 231 +/- 124, 11.7 +/- 6.30, and 6.63 +/- 3.57 Mg ha(-1), respectively. These projections are half the nutrient sequestration potential of existing coastal marshes.

TI  - Effect of Suaeda salsa on Soil Aggregate-Associated Organic Carbon and Nitrogen in Tidal Salt Marshes in the Liaohe Delta, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal wetlands, the effect of vegetation on soil organic carbon (C) quality is not clear. In this study, we investigated soil organic C and total nitrogen (N) in the whole soils, particulate organic matter (POM) and different aggregate fractions in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in Suaeda salsa clusters and bare grounds in the salt marshes of the Liaohe Delta, China. S. salsa increased soil organic C, total N, POMC and POMN concentrations in both soil layers. Interestingly, the presence of S. salsa caused an increase in the amount of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in both 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths, whereas the vegetation effect on microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt- and clay-sized fractions (< 0.053 mm) differed with soil depth. Compared with bare grounds, S. salsa clusters had higher soil organic C and N contents at each aggregate size class. Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest. Our results suggest that vegetation substantially increases the proportion of relatively labile soil organic C and contributes to soil organic C sequestration in tidal salt marshes in the Liaohe Delta, China.

TI  - Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

T2  - CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - Accumulation of significant quantities of organic matter is an important characteristic of anaerobic soils that influences the physical, chemical and biological processes of wetland ecosystems, Organic matter effects include soil water holding capacity, porosity, nutrient storage, nutrient cycling and species composition and abundance of sediment-dwelling invertebrates. These infauna are thought to be important links in transferring primary production from the marsh to the estuarine food web. Tidal marsh restoration and creation often occur on mineral soils that contain little or no organic carbon, and research results indicate that low SOM contents are associated with lower functional value of wetlands. The objectives of this paper are to review the literature and assess the relationship of SOM quantity and quality to functional value of created and restored tidal marshes relative to natural reference marshes. This assessment includes rate of accumulation of organic matter, comparison of carbon and nutrient pools in natural and created marshes, the relationship of organic matter to species composition and abundance of infauna, and the potential for accelerating functional development by adding organic amendments to the soil.

TI  - Mechanisms of enhanced methane emission due to introduction of Spartina anglica and Phragmites australis in a temperate tidal salt marsh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introductions of exotic plants are widespread ecological threats disturbing the carbon and nutrient cycles in global coastal wetlands. Previous studies have found that the invasion has enhanced methane emission through increased primary production and a changed methanogenic pathway. However, the previous studies did not determine the depth profiles of the changes while the depth in the soil profile to which the disturbance propagates is one of the critical issues to be addressed. In this study, we illustrated the depth profiles of the effect of the introductions of S. anglica and P. australis on the potential methane production, soil biogeochemistry, and soil microbial community which play a substantial role in enhanced methane emission due to the invasions. The in situ field measurements and anaerobic incubation were conducted to determine the mechanistic differences of depth profiles. Both introductions of S. anglica and P. australis increased methane emission through different microbial mechanisms depending on depth profile. Potential methane production was stimulated in shallow and deep soil layer of S. anglica and P. australis-introduced marshes, respectively. S. anglica increased the contribution of methylotrophic methanogenesis in top soil layers while P. australis decreased competitive inhibition by sulfate reducers in all soil layers. These results emphasize the importance of below-ground microbial activity and vertical distribution in carbon cycles in tidal marshes. Further plant invasion studies should focus on depth profiles of microbial processes, as their distribution and activity vary substantially across soil depths.

TI  - Estimating the contribution of Spartina anglica biomass to salt-marsh sediments using compound specific stable carbon isotope measurements
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compound specific delta(13)C analyses were used to determine the relative input of a C-4 temperate grass (Spartina anglica) to primary biomass in a salt-marsh sediment. Lipid distributions revealed a C-32 n-alkanol homologue as a characteristically dominant component of Spartina anglica whilst the cohabiting C-3 species, Puccinellia maritima, exhibited a C-26 maximum. The C-32 n-alkanol component was used to create an isotopic mixing model, between organic matter derived from Spartina anglica and Puccinellia maritima, to estimate their relative contribution to the primary biomass input of salt-marsh sediments. The application of sedimentary lipid isotope data to the model gave values of Spartina anglica contributions ranging from 37 to 100%. This investigation represents the first attempt to quantify inputs to sedimentary biomass based on compound specific stable carbon isotope techniques. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemes - a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (co-benefits') for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. Marine protected areas' (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet additionality' requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based locally managed marine areas' (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring permanence' of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.

TI  - Chemical and spectroscopic characteristics of humic acids in marshes from the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To characterise soil humic acids (HAs) extracted from Spanish marshes formed under different vegetation types (Spartina maritima (GSp), Juncus maritimus (GJc), Phragmites australis (GPh), and Scirpus maritimus (VSc)), soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm), physiographic position (low and high marshes), wetland types (salt marshes and lagoons) and environmental conditions (Atlantic and Mediterranean coast).Soil samples were collected in five Spanish marshes, three on the Galicia province and two on the Valencia province. Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.

TI  - Effect of burrowing crabs on retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen in an intertidal salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem engineers that affect other organisms by creating, modifying, maintaining or destroying habitats have received widespread attention. Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography. Taken together, the results of this study provide scientific and effective implication and guidance for the restoration of coastal salt marshes.

TI  - Data for: Invasive Phragmites increases blue carbon stock and soil volume in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh
T2  - Mendeley Data
M3  - Data set
AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to the native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites contributions to soil volume enhances marsh sustainability in the face of sea level rise and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades, but has been little studied on the estuarine portion of the St. Lawrence River. We collected soil cores from Phragmites stand and S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at each Phragmites site. Only bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services. This dataset includes soil carbon and belowground biomass composition data in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh invaded by Phragmites australis. Data were collected in 3 Phragmites sites in 2019 and 1 Spartina patens site in 2014. There are no data in belowgroud biomass composition in S. patens site. Data were collected to estimate the invasive Phragmites contribution to blue carbon stock and soil volume. This dataset contains one Excel file with two sheets ("main data" and "diameter"). These data are from field samples and lab analysis. Dry bulk density is calculated by dividing the dry weight by the initial volume. The organic matter content of the ground samples was measured through loss-on-ignition (LOI) with the equation developed by Craft et al. (1991): % organic carbon = 0.40*%LOI + 0.0025(%LOI)2. As much as possible, rhizomes and roots were identified to species using the key of Niering et al. (1977). We used the color and turgor of rhizomes and roots to discern live from dead. Live material is usually light in color and turgid. Dead tissue is dark and flaccid. Unidentified material (mostly roots) was grouped together as other. The volume of each species was determined by placing the entire sample of a species in a graduated cylinder with a known amount of water and measuring the volume of water displaced. The sorted groups of belowground biomass were oven dried at 60°C to constant weight.

T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of 380 and 720 mumol mol-1 atmospheric CO2 on growth, dry matter allocation, net leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of the C3 salt marsh species Aster tripolium L. and Puccinellia maritima (Hudson) Parl. were studied.  Plants were grown in pots under combinations of low (50-250 mM NaCl) or high (450-550 mM NaCl) salinity and non-flooded or flooded salt marsh soil.  High salinity reduced growth of both species, while flooding increased biomass production of A. tripolium.  Root weight of A. tripolium and total plant weight of P. maritima was increased by atmospheric CO2 enrichment when the soil was flooded.  Under non-flooded conditions, the effect of elevated CO2 on growth was small (P. maritima) or absent (A. tripolium).  The relative increase in total plant weight of both species by elevated CO2 was higher under saline conditions.  Dry matter allocation between root, stem and leaf, as reflected in leaf weight ratio and shoot to root ratio, was not changed by elevated CO2, while specific leaf area was slightly decreased by CO2 enrichment.  Elevated CO2 stimulated net leaf photosynthesis of both species, while stomatal conductance decreased.  These effects were not changed by salinity or flooding treatment.

TI  - A national approach to greenhouse gas abatement through blue carbon management
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating 'blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon withinAustralia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge.We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.

TI  - The flux of chloroform and tetrachloromethane along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh, East China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The fluxes of trichloromethane (CHCl3, CM) and tetrachloromethane (CCl4, TCM) were seasonally measured using static flux chambers over an annual cycle in a coastal salt marsh, East China. The salt marsh presented as a large sink for both the compounds in the growing season (from April to October), but it was a minor source for the gas species in the non-growing season. Generally, the cordgrass marsh acted as a sink of CM and TCM. The net consumption of CM and TCM observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentrations and enriched soil organic matter that result in anoxic sediments. Higher plants were suggested to be an important sink for CM and TCM in the growing season, but a net source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism responsible for the plant removal process is not clear. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation in intertidal marsh soils: Occurrence and environmental significance
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO), consisting of nitrite-dependent DAMO (nitrite-DAMO) and nitrate-dependent DAMO (nitrate-DAMO), has recently been discovered and considered an important link between carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this work, we investigated biodiversity, abundance, and potential methane (CH4) oxidation activity of nitrite-DAMO bacteria and nitrate-DAMO archaea in intertidal marsh soil cores, based on molecular and stable isotope tracing methods. Results evidenced the co-occurrence and vertical stratification of DAMO bacteria and archaea in intertidal marsh soils, with higher biodiversity of DAMO archaea compared with DAMO bacteria. The abundance of DAMO bacterial pmoA gene (8.2 x 10(5)-3.0 x 10(7) copies g dry soil) was approximate to that of DAMO archaeal mcrA gene (3.0 x 10(5)-3.9 x 10 7 copies g(-1) dry soil) in the intertidal marsh soil cores. Stable isotope experiments showed that DAMO bacteria and archaea were both active in the intertidal marshes, with CH4 oxidation potential of 0.1-3.8 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry soil day(-1) and 0.1-4.1 nmol (CO2)-C-13 g(-1) dry soil day(-1), respectively. The relative importance (including the abundance and CH4 oxidation activity) of DAMO bacteria and archaea showed significant vertical variations, with more contribution by DAMO bacteria at the soil-tidal water interface and soil-groundwater interface layers of the soil cores, which are largely due to the influence of tidal dynamics. In addition to playing an important role as CH4 sink, DAMO process was also a non-negligible pathway of nitrogen removal in intertidal marsh soils, with an estimated nitrogen removal rate of 0.4-10.1 nmol N g(-1) dry soil day(-1). Overall, these results illustrated the occurrence and environmental significance of DAMO bioprocess in intertidal marshes.

TI  - Respiration of Louisiana Freshwater Floating Marsh Soils Amended with Ammonium, Phosphate, and Sulfate
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland soils of the freshwater coastal deltaic regions of Louisiana have developed under decreasing influence from the Mississippi River, which has resulted in lower available nutrient conditions and sediment input relative to other coastal marshes. A laboratory soil respiration experiment was conducted to measure cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production in soils from a floating freshwater marsh in response to additions of added ammonium (N), phosphate (P), ammonium (N) + phosphate (P), and sulfate (S). CO2 respiration was significantly greater over a 28-day period than controls following ammonium N, phosphorus, and sulfate addition at 10 mg L-1. Nitrogen and phosphorus addition at 10 mg L-1 also increased methane production. The lower sulfate amendment (10 mg L-1) did not significantly increase CH4 production. In contrast, the greatest sulfate treatment (100 m L-1) significantly reduced total carbon (C) production by inhibiting CH4 production. The fact that soil C/N (20.2) and C/P (355) ratios were both relatively low may partially explain why both N and P colimited microbial activity and respiration. While microbial activity of freshwater floating marsh soils was stimulated over the short term with increased ammonium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfate exposure, it is unclear whether the increase would be the same over extended periods or would increase in plant productivity from nutrient additions compensate for any loss in soil carbon.

TI  - Invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on methane emission and organic carbon sequestration in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to China in 1979 for the purpose of sediment stabilization and dike protection, and has continuously replaced native plants or invaded bare mudflats in the coastal marsh. To evaluate the spatial variation of CH4 emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S. alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicated that S. alterniflora invasion effectively sequestrated atmospheric CO2 and mitigated GWP in the coastal marsh of China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of soil and vegetation processes in the control of organic and mineral fluxes in some western European salt marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative studies of salt marsh productivity, the pool of nutrients in marsh soils, and the associated fluxes of nutrients, sediments and organic matter have been made in the UK, The Netherlands, Portugal and France. These have shown contrasting relationships between the functional maturity of a marsh and the direction and magnitude of associated fluxes. Actively-extending marshes tend to be flood-dominated systems and net importers of sediment and organic matter, while exporting mineral nutrients. Marshes that are not extending, however, are usually ebb-dominated, net exporters of organic matter and even sediment. These latter marshes can best be regarded as 'mature' or, if they are showing signs of decay, as 'over-mature', in contrast to the 'immature' marshes that are still growing.Soil available phosphorus (PO4-P) concentrations measured ranged from 15 to 200 mg/kg, and influenced the primary productivity of the marsh. PO4-P concentrations are themselves partly controlled by the origin and amount of sedimentation on the marsh surface. In contrast, soil inorganic nitrogen showed a strong seasonal trend, with minimum concentrations, related to plant uptake, occurring in early summer.The breakdown of organic matter, both above and below the soil surface, appears more rapid in a healthy mature marsh than in a degenerating marsh, and physical processes in the creeks are more pronounced. Low levels of soil microbial activity, immobilization of mineral nitrogen and the slow breakdown of plant litter would seem to characterize degenerating 'over-mature' marshes. Despite these factors, there was little or no difference in the Net Aerial Primary Productivity (300-800 g m(-2) y(-1)) measured at two marshes, one of each type, in the UK.

TI  - Seasonal changes in soil TN and SOC in a seawall-reclaimed marsh in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marsh has been globally fragmented by man-made coastal seawalls. However, the dynamic changes in community structure and abiotic environments in these regenerated marsh after seawall reclamation are largely unknown. We analyzed the seasonal changes of soil nutrient pools and the direction effects on them. The results showed that soil total nitrogen (TN) has decreased but soil organic carbon (SOC) has increased from May to September. Direction has influenced the patterns and seasonal changes in soil TN and SOC. The potential influencing factors have been largely contributed to soil salinity reduction, vegetation growth, microorganism activities with different seasonal characteristics. Researches on seasonal dynamic of marsh regeneration after seawall reclamation can provide us helpful information to understand mechanism of marsh restoration and design coastal marsh restoration projects.

T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Habitat fragmentation is known to be one of the leading causes of species extinctions, however few studies have explored how habitat fragmentation impacts ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling, especially in wetland ecosystems. Objectives We aimed to determine how habitat fragmentation, defined by habitat area and distance from habitat edge, impacts the above-ground carbon cycling and nutrient stoichiometry of a foundation species in a coastal salt marsh. Methods We conducted our research in a salt marsh in the Mid-Atlantic United States, where the foundation grass speciesSpartina patensis being replaced by a more flood-tolerant grass, leading to highly fragmented habitat patches. We quantified decomposition rates, live biomass, and litter accumulation ofS. patensat patch edges and interiors. Additionally, we measured relevant characteristics (e.g., habitat area, elevation, microclimate) ofS. patenspatches. Results Habitat edge effects, and not habitat area effects, had distinct impacts on ecosystem functioning. Habitat edges had less litter accumulation, faster decomposition rates, a warmer and drier microclimate, and lower elevations than patch interiors. Patches with low elevation edges had the fastest decomposition rates, while interiors of patches at any elevation had the slowest decomposition rates. Notably, these impacts were not driven by changes in primary production. Conclusion Habitat fragmentation impacts the above-ground carbon cycling ofS. patensin coastal wetlands by altering litter decomposition, but not primary production, through habitat edge effects. Future research should investigate whether this pattern scales across broader landscapes and if it is observable in other wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Reconstructing the Genetic Potential of the Microbially-Mediated Nitrogen Cycle in a Salt Marsh Ecosystem
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are considered buffer zones for the discharge of land-derived nutrients without accounting for potential negative side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the ecological assembly and dynamics of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in such systems. Here, we employed two complementary methodological approaches (i.e., shotgun metagenomics and quantitative PCR) to examine the distribution and abundance of selected microbial genes involved in N transformations. We used soil samples collected along a well-established pristine salt marsh soil chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development at the island of Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands. Across the examined soil successional stages, the structure of the populations of genes involved in N cycling processes was strongly related to (shifts in the) soil nitrogen levels (i.e., NO3-, NH4+), salinity and pH (explaining 73.8% of the total variation, R-2 = 0.71). Quantification of the genes used as proxies for N fixation, nitrification and denitrification revealed clear successional signatures that corroborated the taxonomic assignments obtained by metagenomics. Notably, we found strong evidence for niche partitioning, as revealed by the abundance and distribution of marker genes for nitrification (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea) and denitrification (nitrite reductase nIrK, nirS and nitrous oxide reductase nosZ clades I and II). This was supported by a distinct correlation between these genes and soil physico-chemical properties, such as soil physical structure, pH, salinity, organic matter, total N. NO3-,NH4+ and SO42-, across four seasonal samplings. Overall, this study sheds light on the successional trajectories of microbial N cycle genes along a naturally developing salt marsh ecosystem. The data obtained serve as a foundation to guide the formulation of ecological models that aim to effectively monitor and manage pristine and impacted salt marsh areas. Such models should account for the ecology as well as the historical contingency of N cycling communities.

TI  - Effects of morphological changes on metal accumulation in a salt marsh sediment of the Skallingen peninsula, Denmark
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1931 a red-colored, sandy marker horizon was placed on the emerging Skallingen salt marsh. Sedimentation on top of the marker horizon since then shows two opposing tendencies. Coincident with salt marsh development the sediments display up to 1964 a fining upward sequence with an increasing content of organic matter. Since 1964 a nearby creek has meandered towards the sampling plot. Consequently, the sediments become coarser with a decreasing organic matter content. The morphological induced changes in sedimentary conditions strongly influence metal content in the sediments and thereby hide anthropogenic induced concentration variations. Thus, an apparently diminishing Zn content (per kg dry weight) since 1964 could indicate lesser load to the area. However, corrected for grain size effects there is an increasing content of Zn. Other metal concentrations (e.g. Cu) show a diminishing trend when corrected for grain size effects and therefore indicate a reduced anthropogenic induced load of these metals to the salt marsh.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion alters the fundamental structure and function of native ecosystems by affecting the biogeochemical pools and fluxes of materials and energy. Native (Suaeda salsa) and invasive (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes were selected to study the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and stocks in the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that the SOC contents (g/kg) and stocks (kg/m(2)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years, especially for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The SOC contents exhibited an even distribution along the soil profiles in native salt marshes, while the SOC contents were gradually decreased with depth after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years. The natural ln response ratios (LnRR) were applied to identify the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on the SOC stocks. We also found that Spartina alterniflora invasion might cause soil organic carbon losses in a short-term phase (2-4 years in this study) due to the negative LnRR values, especially for 20-60 cm depth. And the SOCD in surface layer (0-20 cm) do not increase linearly with the invasive age. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that silt + clay content was exponentially related with SOC in surface layer (Adjusted R-2 = 0.43, P < 0.001), suggesting that soil texture could play a key role in SOC sequestration of coastal salt marshes.

T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon      in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic      alteration and management of these ecosystems. Efforts to restore tidal      flow to former salt marshes has increased in recent decades, and is      generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and      salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity      changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation      period. Intact soil cores from impounded freshwater marsh and salt marsh      were incubated after addition of either seawater or fresh water under      flooded and drained water levels. Elevating freshwater marsh salinity to 6      to 9 ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50% -80% and most typically decreased      CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26 ppt to 19 ppt in      salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from      altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting      ~10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments.      Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC)      concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the      incubations of freshwater marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that      relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was      preferentially oxidized when seawater was introduced. This study suggests      that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained      conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C      sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration increase soil C      decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this      impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the      return of flooding conditions.

TI  - Soil-geomorphology relationships and landscape evolution in a southwestern Atlantic tidal salt marsh in Patagonia, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes in Patagonia ecosystem are nowadays fully recognized by ecological, pollution and phytoremediation studies but a soil genesis and geomorphology approach is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to establish the soil-geomorphology relationship in Fracasso salt marsh and to determine the successional vegetation dynamics associated with the landscape evolution. This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.

TI  - Nutrient Availability and Soil Organic Matter Decomposition Response to Prescribed Burns in Mid-Atlantic Brackish Tidal Marshes
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed fire in tidal marshes has been shown to generate short-term increases in plant-available nutrients, but the long-term implications of fire on nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition have not been well established. Two manipulative experiments were conducted over 1 yr within long-term annual burn and no-burn blocks at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Cambridge, MD to study the effects of canopy removal and ash deposition on nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition rates following burning. Ash deposition had no significant effects on study variables. At no-burn sites, porewater NH4+ and PO43+ were significantly lower in July in sites with canopy removal (0.15 mg NH4+ L-1 and 0.04 mg PO43+ L-1) compared to sites with a canopy (0.73 mg NH4+ L-1 and 0.08 mg PO43+ L-1). Similar results were found through a canopy replacement treatment at annual burn sites. Decreased porewater NH4+ and PO43+ corresponded to increased total biomass nutrient content. No-burn sites with canopy removal treatments showed significantly lower organic matter decomposition rates than did treatments with a canopy in July (66.5 vs. 74.1% cotton tensile strength loss), corresponding to decreases in porewater NH4+ and PO43+. Plant ash provided a fertilizer pulse of 0.22 g N m(-2) and 0.16 g P m(-2), which were amounts of N and P likely too small to increase plant productivity when deposited during late winter/early spring. Prescribed fire appears to affect nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition in these marsh soils primarily through the mechanism of increased biomass production due to canopy removal.

TI  - Testate Amoebae as Proxy for Water Level Changes in a Brackish Tidal Marsh
T2  - ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have examined testate amoebae assemblages of estuarine tidal marshes. This study investigates the possibility of using soil testate amoebae assemblages of a brackish tidal marsh (Scheldt estuary, Belgium) as a proxy for water level changes. On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, flooding frequency and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with flooding frequencies equal to or higher than 36.5%. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone's testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the flooding frequency (similar to elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh. Testate amoeba assemblages in such a brackish habitat show thus a vertical zonation (RMSEP: 0.19 m) that is comparable to the vertical zonation of testate amoebae and other protists on freshwater tidal marshes and salt marshes.

TI  - Changes in ecosystem nitrogen and carbon allocation with black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment into Spartina alterniflora salt marsh
T2  - SEANOE
M3  - Data set
AB  - Increases in temperature are expected to facilitate encroachment of tropical mangrove forests into temperate salt marshes, yet the effects on ecosystem services are understudied. Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment into Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (i.e., root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (i.e., carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground tissues compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean. Copyright: CC-BY-NC-SA

TI  - Yak excreta-induced changes in soil microbial communities increased the denitrification rate of marsh soil under warming conditions
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial denitrification is a major contributor to the terrestrial production of greenhouse nitrous oxide (N2O). The responses of soil denitrifiers to yak excreta addition in marsh soil under a warming background have not been well evaluated. We investigated the soil physicochemical properties, denitrification rate (DR), enzymes and community of denitrifier genes (nirS and nirK) of marsh soil with different yak excreta additions (dung addition, D; urine addition, U) on the Southeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under three different temperatures (13 degrees C, 19 degrees C and 25 degrees C). Excreta addition significantly increased the DR of marsh soil under different temperatures (P < 0.05). However, as temperature increased, yak excreta addition had no obvious effect on nitrate reductase (NAR) and nitrite reductase (NIR). Excreta addition reduced the diversity of the denitrifier community. nirK was more sensitive to excreta addition and temperature than nirS. For nirK, the proportions of Phyllobacteriaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae were greater than those of other species and were mainly observed in the control (CK) and U, and Rhizobiaceae was mainly distributed in D. The proportion of Rhizobiaceae increased with increasing temperature, but the proportion of Hyphomicrobiaceae decreased. Unclassified Proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria were the dominant species for nirS. Oxalobacteraceae and Rhodocyclaceae were much more sensitive to temperature changes than other denitrifiers. The nirK community was mainly affected by NO2-N and TOC, but NO2-N and AP had a significant effect on nirS. AP, NO2-N and moisture could affect DR directly or indirectly by affecting the diversity of the denitrifier community and soil enzymes. Our findings suggest that yak excreta addition could profoundly promote DR by regulating the diversity of the denitrifier community of marsh ecosystems under warming conditions.

TI  - Carbon gas production under different electron acceptors in a freshwater marsh soil
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of carbon (C) gas emission from wetlands influence global C cycling. In many freshwater systems such as Louisiana freshwater marsh, soil contents of NO3- and SO42- have increased due to nutrient loading and saltwater intrusion. This could affect C mineralization and the emission of the major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In this investigation, a laboratory microcosm study was carried out to elucidate the effects of NO3- and SO42- on CO2 and CH4 production from a freshwater marsh soil located in the Barataria Basin of Louisiana coast, which has been subjected to the Mississippi River diversion and seawater intrusion. Composite soil samples were collected from top 50 cm marsh profile, treated with different levels of NO3- (0, 3.2 and 5 mM) or SO42- (0, 2, and 5 mM) concentrations, and incubated for 214 d under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that the presence of NO3 (especially at 3.2 mM) significantly decreased CO2 productions whereas SO42- did not. On the other hand, both NO3- and SO2- treatments decreased CH4 production but the NO3- almost completely inhibited CH4 pro duction (>99%) whereas the SO42- treatments reduced CH4 production by 78-90%. The overall C mineralization rate constant under the NO3 presence was also low. In addition, the results revealed that a large proportion (95Z) of anaerobic carbon mineralization in the untreated freshwater soil was unexplained by the reduction of any of the measured major electron acceptors.

TI  - Effects of invasion of Spartina alterniflora and exogenous N deposition on N2O emissions in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation alteration and nitrogen inputs (via run-off, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater) as a result of anthropogenic activities strongly affected the emission of N2O from coastal marshes. To gain insight into impacts of the invasion of Spartina alterniflora and N deposition on N2O fluxes, mesocosms experiments were conducted to measure N2O emissions from marshes vegetated with S. alterniflora and a native Phragmites australis, with or without exogenous N at the rates of 2.7 g N m(-2), respectively. Mean N2O fluxes during the growing season in S. alterniflora mesocosms without N addition was 9.36 mu g m(-2) h(-1), significantly higher than 6.79 mu g m-2 h-1 in P. australis mesocosms. The stimulatory effects could be attributed to higher plant biomass of S. alterniflora providing more labile organic C to the rhizosphere for nitrobacteria and denitrifying bacteria, and to more oxygen transported to the rhizosphere facilitating coupled nitrification and denitrification. N deposition increased N2O fluxes in S. alterniflora and P. australis mesocosms by 13.5% and 48.2%, respectively, suggesting that exogenous N significantly promoted N2O emissions from coastal marshes. Compared to mesocosms without N fertilization, the increase rate of total N accumulation and above-ground biomass under N addition were 63.1% and 28.0% in the S. alterniflora mesocosms, whereas 26.7% and 15.3% in the P. australis mesocosms, respectively. This meant stronger competition of S. alterniflora with soil microorganisms for the available N, leading to lower increment of N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora mesocosms under N addition. Thus, it could be concluded that both the invasion of S. alterniflora and atmospheric N deposition dramatically stimulated N2O emissions from coastal marshes, and that N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora marshes weakly responded to N addition.

TI  - The parA Region of Broad-Host-Range PromA Plasmids Is a Carrier of Mobile Genes
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological competences in microbiomes are driven by the adaptive capabilities present within microbiome members. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) promoted by plasmids provides a rapid adaptive strategy to microbiomes, an interesting feature considering the constantly changing conditions in most environments. This study examined the parA locus, found in the highly promiscuous PromA class of plasmids, as the insertion site for incoming genes. A novel PCR system was designed that enabled examining insertions into this locus. Microbiomes of mangrove sediments, salt marsh, mycosphere, and bulk soil revealed habitat-specific sets of insertions in this plasmid region. Furthermore, such habitats could be differentiated based on patterns of parA-inserted genes, and the genes carried by these plasmids. Thus, a suite of dioxygenase-related genes and transposase elements were found in oil-affected mangroves, whereas genes involved in nitrogen and carbon cycling were detected in salt marsh and soils. All genes detected could be associated with capabilities of members of the microbiome to adapt to and survive in each habitat. The methodology developed in this work was effective, sensitive, and practical, allowing detection of mobilized genes between microorganisms.

TI  - Soil chemical and biochemical properties of a salt-marsh alluvial Spanish area after long-term reclamation
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marisma, one of the largest salt-marsh alluvial areas in SW Spain, has been reclaimed since 1970 by artificial drainage and amendment with phosphogypsum (PG) so as to reduce Na+ saturation. Within the reclaimed area, two 250- x 20-m plots were treated as follows: (1) amendment with 25 Mg/ha of PG every 2 to 3 years between 1979 and 2003 (plot PY); (2) like PY but PG treatment stopped after 1997 (plot DR). A contiguous virgin Marisma salt-marsh plot (MV), neither drained nor amended, was the control. In MV, soil microbial biomass C, most enzyme activities and total organic C content were much greater than in PY and DR soils, despite the salinity stress. The decrease in soil organic matter content in PY and DR soils was likely due to cotton-cropping practices, which favoured the organic C mineralisation and nutrients removal by crops. Microbial activity of MV soil, probably stimulated by the rhizodepositions of the natural vegetation, did not suffer from the osmotic effect due to the raising of soil solution ionic strength. Microbial quotient could be ranked as MV > PY > DR, whereas the metabolic quotient had an opposite trend. Thus, both quotients suggested that the interruption of PG amendment was not favouring microbial activity. Principal component analysis clearly identified the chemical and biochemical soil properties mostly affected by the reclamation and also indicated the longer PG amendment in PY plot. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified two physiologically different types of soil microflora, one less active present in the MV virgin soil and another more active present in the reclaimed PY and DR soils.

TI  - Whether disturbances alter salt marsh soil structure dramatically affects Spartina alterniflora recolonization rate
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance regimes are shifting in response to climate change, land-use change, species' invasions, and other stressors, challenging ecologists to improve understanding of the mechanisms controlling plant recovery under different conditions. In this study, we investigate mechanisms that underpin plant recolonization of two types of disturbance: disturbances that remove standing plant biomass, but leave the underlying soil structure largely intact, and those that remove standing biomass and physically disrupt soil structure. In the southeastern United States, salt marshes, drought and invasive feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are associated with disturbances of these respective types and both leave behind mudflats dotted with patches of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), the system's dominant foundation species. To test how disturbance type and remnant patch size may interact to affect cordgrass recolonization, we transplanted replicate cordgrass patches of three sizes into one mudflat that experienced vegetation-only disturbance (VD) during a recent drought, and a second mudflat where hog activities had disrupted the soil structure creating a soil + vegetation disturbance (soil + VD). Over one year, we monitored plant performance and properties of soil. Compared with the drought-associated VD where patches, regardless of their size, expanded vigorously, large and medium patches grew little and smaller patches even less in the hog-associated soil + VD mudflat. Moreover while biogeochemical properties varied little in the VD compared with adjacent vegetated marsh areas, the mudflats with soil + VD had less soil-binding organic matter and, hence, were too soft to support crab burrows, leading to a reduction in oxygen availability and cordgrass expansion. These results indicate that cordgrass recovery is far faster from disturbances that do not degrade soil structure than those that do and therefore advocate for disturbance-specific management strategies. Specifically, while transplanting patches is effective in restoring marshes disturbed by drought, wrack, or other factors that leave soil structure intact, preventative measures, like hog population culling, are essential to mitigating the ecological impacts of soil structure-altering disturbances.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of the gross primary production in the salt marshes with rapid community change: A coupled modeling approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. However, rapid changes in the vegetation communities of salt marshes caused by exotic species invasion and plant propagation requires a better understanding of how these shifts affect the landscape-scale variations of gross primary production (GPP). In the Yangtze Estuary of eastern China, we firstly compared 2-years GPP values obtained through eddy covariance measurements, satellite-based estimations and model simulations in two vegetation mixtures consisting of exotic Spartina alterniflora (C-4 plant) and dominant native Phragmites australis and Scirpus spp. (C-3 plants) The results indicated that the low-resolution remote sensing data with light-use efficiency method did not represent well the seasonal course of GPP relative to flux measurements and underestimated the annual amount GPP by 25-32%. In contrast, a detailed process based vegetation model with species-specific parameterizations could identify the proportions of GPP from exotic C-4 and native C-3 vegetation and accurately reproduce the seasonal course and annual amount of GPP in the mixtures. The slopes of the linear regressions between the measured and modeled GPP were close (1.09 and 0.89 for the two mixtures, respectively) to the 1:1 line. To further evaluate the variations in GPP throughout the salt marshes, we coupled high-resolution remote sensing data to the vegetation model by transforming the vegetation index into the leaf area index (LAI) for different species. The coupled model reproduced the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP in the salt marshes with rapid community change during the period of 2000-2008 and identified the variations of GPP from different species. The simulations indicated that the contribution rate of exotic S. alterniflora to GPP has been greater than that of native species since 2003-2004. Therefore, we suggest that this method is useful for high-resolution estimations of regional GPP in other coastal marshes with invasive S. alterniflora in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Processes Influencing Marsh Elevation Change in Low- and High-Elevation Zones of a Temperate Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The movement of salt marshes into uplands and marsh submergence as sea level rises is well documented; however, predicting how coastal marshes will respond to rising sea levels is constrained by a lack of process-based understanding of how various marsh zones adjust to changes in sea level. To assess the way in which salt marsh zones differ in their elevation response to sea-level change, and to evaluate how potential hydrologic drivers influence the response, surface elevation tables, marker horizons, and shallow rod surface elevation tables were installed in a Virginia salt marsh in three zones that differed in elevation and vegetation type. Decadal rates of elevation change, surface accretion, and shallow subsidence or expansion were examined in the context of hydrologic drivers that included local sea-level rise, flooding frequency, hurricane storm surge, and precipitation. Surface elevation increases were fastest in the low-elevation zone, intermediate in the middle-elevation zone, and slowest in the high-elevation zone. These rates are similar to (low and middle marsh) or less than (high marsh) local rates of sea-level rise. Root zone expansion, presumably due to root growth and organic matter accumulation, varied among the three salt marsh zones and accounted for 37%, but probably more, of the increase in marsh surface elevation. We infer that, during marsh transgression, soil-forming processes shift from biogenic (high marsh) to minerogenic (low marsh) in response, either directly or indirectly, to changing hydrologic drivers.

TI  - Compilation of radionuclides, mercury contaminations, and ln(Zr/Rb) ratios, together with mean grain size and organic carbon data records, obtained from sediment sequences of the south-eastern North Sea region
T2  - PANGAEA
M3  - Data set
AB  - Depositional processes in coastal wetlands respond to a changing climate as documented in the sediment successions of salt marshes. In this context, robust chronologies are crucial for the reconstruction of salt-marsh depositional processes in the past. However, salt-marsh sediments from the highly dynamic North Sea coast often lack a reliable stratigraphy due to the combined influences of natural processes and human activities, causing a reworking and re-deposition of the sediments. Here, a combination of absolute and relative dating methods was applied in order to establish an integrated stratigraphic framework for active foreland salt marshes along the south-eastern North Sea coast. This stratigraphic framework is based on radionuclides (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C) and mercury (Hg) contaminations, together with ln(Zr/Rb) as a grain-size proxy for additional inter-correlation between the sites. The studied salt marshes encompass different environmental settings concerning the inundation frequency and intensity, and anthropogenic influences. As a result, the reconstructed average sediment accretion rates range from 1.31 cm yr-1 in the more sheltered and semi-enclosed salt marshes in the Bay of Tumlau, to 1.16 cm yr-1 in the anthropogenic modified and grazed coastal salt marsh at Friedrichskoog, and to 1.75 cm yr-1 in the dynamic open coastal salt marsh at Kaiser-Wilhelm-Koog. Similar mean high accretion rates of 1.72 cm yr-1 are documented for the Eider estuary until AD 1965, before they dropped to 0.72 cm yr-1 after completion of the Eider tidal barrier in AD 1973. The results highlight the advantage of combining independent dating methods for the establishment of salt-marsh chronologies. The reconstructed sediment-accretion rates suggest a high resilience of salt-marsh systems to ongoing sea-level rise as long as sediment availability and natural flooding dynamics are maintained.

TI  - Water salinity and inundation control soil carbon decomposition during salt marsh restoration: An incubation experiment
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

TI  - The role of tidal salt marsh as an energy source for marine transient and resident finfishes: A stable isotope approach
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S) in bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and white perch Morons americana from Delaware Bay were a function of capture location and, for restored tidal salt marshes, possibly a function of the relative position of the marsh restoration trajectory. White perch collected in polyhaline restoration and reference (Moore's Beach) sites had stable isotope signatures that reflected contributions from both benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. Isotope values from white perch captured at the reference site were slightly enriched compared with those captured at the restoration sites. At upper estuary oligo-mesohaline locations, Phragmites australis contributed to the isotopic composition of both species. Although P. australis was not dominant at the reference marsh (Mad Horse Creek), it also seemed to influence the dow of nutrients into these species. White perch were not collected in open waters of Delaware Bay, but bay anchovy were abundant at offshore sampling stations. A striking result of this study was that stable isotopes that originated in macrophytes and benthic microalgae of salt marshes occurred ubiquitously among bay anchovy collected several kilometers from shore. Interestingly, fish from Mad Horse Creek, a reference marsh where Phragmites was abundant only along creek banks, were intermediate in their isotopic composition. Although benthic microalgal signatures varied both within and among sites, the isotopic composition of bay anchovy and white perch was clearly influenced by these primary producers across all marsh types. Particulate organic matter (POM) appeared to play a lesser role in bay anchovy and white perch nutrition, although depletion of POM sulfur due to the presence of inorganic sulfur may have led to underestimates of the contribution of phytoplankton. Further studies are required to elucidate the relative role of phytoplankton in the trophodynamics of these species.

TI  - Variability of soil carbon sequestration capability and microbial activity of different types of salt marsh soils at Chongming Dongtan
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the soil carbon sequestration capability of different types of salt marsh soils at Chongming Dongtan and its influencing factors were studied by analyzing the soil organic carbon (SOC) content, organic matter input and microbial activities. The results indicated that the total SOC content at Area A (southeast of Dongtan, sandy soil with Phragmites communis) was only 46.11% of that of Area B (northeast of Dongtan, clay soil with mixed P. communis and Spartina alterniflora)(P= 0.000 < 0.05), but their organic matter input per year was almost identical. These findings implied that Area B had a lower output of SOC. The microbial biomass at Area A was 3.83 times greater than that at Area B (P= 0.049 < 0.05); the soil catalase and invertase activities at Area A, which were related to carbon metabolism, were 60.31% (P=0.006 < 0.05) and 34.33% (P=0.021 < 0.05) higher than at Area B, respectively; and the soil respiration at Area A was also higher than at Area B. These findings implied that the microbial activities at Area A were greater than those at Area B, and therefore the carbon metabolism was rapid, resulting in increased SOC output at Area A. Increased water content and salinity in the clay soil at Area B may inhibit the microbial activities, thereby reducing the decomposition of the organic matter and enhancing carbon sequestration. In addition, some artificial measures for controlling spread of S. alterniflora at Area B (mowing/digging and tillage (M + D); mowing/digging and tillage/waterlogging (M + D + W)) were found to generally improve the microbial activity of soil, thereby increasing SOC output. However, when the two different physical controlling modes were compared, the SOC and microbial activities of the soil subjected to the M + D + W treatment were relatively high and low, respectively, due to waterlogging restraining the microbial metabolism. These findings indicated that the difference in microbial activities was the important factor leading to variability in the SOC sequestration capability between Areas A and B. Additionally, with the exception of soil texture and vegetation types, environmental conditions and artificial turbulence also influenced microbial activities of soil, and hence SOC output and organic carbon sequestration capability.

TI  - Nitrogen Compounds in the Soil of the Continental Margins of the European Russian Arctic
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The specific features in the distribution of organic and mineral nitrogen compounds in marsh and tundra soils of the European Russian Arctic (coastal areas of the Barents and White Seas) were analyzed. Total nitrogen was determined by gas chromatography (CHNS-O elemental analyzer), and inorganic nitrogen, by photometry. The composition of hydrolyzable amino acids was analyzed by liquid chromatography on ion exchange resins. Mineral compounds accounted for an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (to 97% of the total content) was represented by organic substances (N-org). The N-org varied within a wide range in both marsh (0.3-15.8 g/kg) and tundra soils (5-20 g/kg in the peat horizons and 0.3-2 g/kg in the mineral horizons). The content of N-NH4+ varied from 5 to 20 mg/kg in marsh soils and from 30 to 200 mg/kg in tundra soils. In marsh soils, the content of nitrate nitrogen was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in the upper horizons. Marsh soils were characterized by the accumulation of N-org either on the surface or in the middle part of the profile in the presence of humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments. The accumulation of N-org and N-NH4+ was observed above the permafrost in the peat-gley soil and in the permafrost in the oligotrophic peat soil. The content of hydrolyzable amino acids in the soils of different geneses was 0.6-8 g/kg, which corresponded to 30-60% of the soil organic nitrogen and 2-12% of the soil organic carbon. Distribution patterns of the amino acid nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the soil profiles were similar. The qualitative composition of amino compounds was relatively uniform, and the ratios of most of them were close. The shares of arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine were less than 4% each; of lysine, valine, proline, serine, and threonine, 5 to 7%; and of alanine and leucine, 10-12%. The share of glycine increased downward the profile from 12 to 20%, and the shares of aspartic and glutamic acids decreased from 11 to 6%. In marsh soils, N-org, N-NH4+, and nitrogen of most amino acids correlated (r = 0.6-0.9) with the clay content and nonsilicate iron forms. The tightest correlations were observed between the dithionite-soluble iron and the nitrogen of threonine and histidine.

TI  - METHANE AND REDUCED SULFUR GAS-PRODUCTION BY FRESH AND DRIED WETLAND SOILS
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland soil microorganisms are probably influenced by fluctuating water levels and by longer-term climatic change. This study investigated production of CH4 and reduced S gases [H2S, CH3SH, (CH3)(2)S, COS, and CS2] by both freshly collected and air-dried, rewet soils from four wetlands in the Mississippi deltaic plain. Soils from three depth intervals (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) from a swamp forest (Typic Hydraquent), a freshwater marsh (Terric Medisaprist), an intermediate salinity marsh (Typic Medisaprist), and a salt marsh (Typic Medisaprist) were incubated under anaerobic conditions. At repeated time intervals, the headspace gas was analyzed and then purged with N-2. Peak production rates of both CH4 and H2S occurred earlier in the fresh soils than in the dried soils in almost all cases. Presumably, this time lag associated with drying was caused by an increase in potentially reducible Mn and Fe. Nevertheless, drying increased labile C levels, thus total CH4 production was similar during the entire 69-d incubation. Production of CH4 was positively correlated with organic matter content (fresh, R(2) = 0.52; dried, R(2) = 0.64) and labile C (fresh, R(2) = 0.83; dried, R(2) = 0.89). Due to their relatively low concentrations, inclusion of soil oxidants in a model did not significantly improve the fit of a model that already contained a term for labile C. Production of S gases was positively correlated with initial SO42- concentrations (fresh, R(2) = 0.,75; dried, R(2) = 0.42). Drying significantly decreased total H2S production only for the salt marsh soils. In contrast, the drying treatment increased CH3SH production; only these soils produced (CH3)(2)S, COS, and CS2.

TI  - Soils and 'managed retreat' in South East England
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the low-lying farmland around the coastline of south-cast England was once inter-tidal salt marsh, which was subsequently reclaimed from the sea and converted to farmland. It is becoming increasingly uneconomic to maintain the embankments which protect this land from the sea.'Managed retreat' involves relocating the embankments further inland and recreating inter-tidal habitat in front of them. Salt marsh not only provides a protective buffer for these sea walls by dissipating wave energy, but is also important as a habitat for birds and as a source of organic matter for fish and inter-tidal fauna.When 'managed retreat' takes place, the creation of inter-tidal habitat occurs on soils that have undergone physical and chemical changes, some of which are irreversible. However, the indications are that rapid sedimentation creates conditions in which salt marsh plants germinate and become established; soil salinity rises quickly to a level which restricts competition from terrestrial plants, and deposited sediment is relatively rich in available phosphorus. The physical properties of the old agricultural soil influence the subsequent development of creeks.

TI  - Characteristics and Functions of Labile Organic Carbon in Coastal Wetland Soils of the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain
T2  - LABILE ORGANIC MATTER - CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, FUNCTION, AND SIGNIFICANCE IN SOIL AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Mississippi River deltaic plain (MRDP) coastal wetlands are one of the largest in the United States. Adequate characterization of labile organic C (LOC) is essential for understanding the C transformation and overall biogeochemistry in these wetland soils. Among different MRDP wetlands, freshwater and brackish marsh soils contain higher LOC than saline marsh and forest swamp soils. Labile organic C estimated by aerobic incubation and salt and cold water extractions is generally less than 0.5% of soil organic C (SOC), whereas hot water extraction and especially acid hydrolysis yield 1.2 to 3.49% and 12.8 to 43% of SOC, respectively. Carboxyl C was the primary component of LOC by cold water and salt extractions, whereas both carboxyl C and O/N-alkyl C were released by aerobic mineralization. On the other hand, LOC by hot water extraction contains mainly carbonyl C, whereas acid hydrolysis includes the contribution of alkyl C besides O/N-alkyl C. In addition, higher LOC in freshwater marsh soils than in saline and forest swamp soils facilitates higher denitrification potential of the former, which is negatively correlated with the presence of phenolic aldehydes and ketones in these wetland soils. The addition of clay sediments reduce LOC degradation as is evident by lowered CO2 emissions. Monovalent K+ holds more DOC in forest swamp soils, whereas divalent Ca2+ retains more DOC in marsh soils. Selective degradation of syringyl lignin structure over guaiacyl occurs in both dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bulk soil organic matter (SOM) in the MRDP wetlands, which could enhance overall SOC lability and potentially contribute to the northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxia if exported offshore.

TI  - Carbon offset market methodologies applicable for coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the United States: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe.

TI  - MICROBIAL UTILIZATION RESULTING IN EARLY DIAGENESIS OF SALT-MARSH HUMIC ACIDS
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We have shown earlier that fresh and dead tissues of Spartina alterniflora, a plant species dominating Atlantic and Gulf coast salt-marshes, contain humic substances that may be released into sea water and sediment and that resemble sedimentary humic acids. In this study we found that the salt-marsh sediment-related microflora is capable of employing these humic substances under aerobic or semi-anaerobic conditions both as a supplemental source of nutrients and as the sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. Depending on cultivation conditions and type of humic substances, between 27 and 100% of the added humic acids were used. Humic acids recovered from aerobic cultures exhibited elemental and structural changes that are characteristic of diagenetic transformations of sedimentary humic substances, i.e. increase in carbon content, C:H and C:N ratios, optical density and infra-red absorption typical for aromatics. A decrease was found in oxygen content and infra-red absorption associated with proteinaceous and carbohydrate-like components of these substances. Under semi-anaerobic conditions different changes in elemental and structural characteristics of humic acids were observed.

TI  - A 30-year record of sedimentary phosphorus species in a coastal salt marsh southwest of Hangzhou Bay, China
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, two sediment cores (C1 and C2) were collected from the Andong salt marsh southwest of Hangzhou Bay and analysed to determine their different sedimentary phosphorus (P) forms. The changes in the sedimentary P forms over the past 30 years and the implication of these changes on environmental risks were determined. The low mean total P (TP) contents along C1 (30.42 mg/kg) and C2 (68.60 mg/kg) indicate no P pollution in the Andong salt marsh. The sedimentary TP and all P forms decreased towards the present due to a reduction in particle size and an overall decrease in nutrient input. The sedimentary P contents were also affected by other factors, such as typhoons, bridge construction and aquaculture activities that facilitated erosion and increased P input, whereas drought caused a reduction in sedimentary P. Organic P (OP) represented more than half of the TP, and NaOH-P (P bound to Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides) represented more than half of the inorganic P (IP), indicating an overall high level of bioavailable P. Thus, the sediments in the Andong salt marsh could be releasing P during organic matter decomposition and under anoxic conditions.

TI  - Tidal influences on carbon assimilation by a salt marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Net carbon dioxide (CO2) ecosystem exchanges in coastal salt marshes remain poorly investigated. In Spartina alterniflora dominated North American Atlantic coast marshes, the lack of a clear understanding of how Spartina alterniflora responds to flooding limits our current ability to understand and predict salt marsh response to sea-level rise. Here we investigate the processes influencing ecosystem-level carbon exchanges between a S. alterniflora dominated salt marsh on the eastern shore of Virginia and the atmosphere. We examined the impacts of tidal inundation on the marsh-atmosphere carbon exchanges through a combination of eddy covariance measurements and in situ photosynthetic measurements. Maximum daytime carbon fluxes were observed during the middle of the growing season (July and August) and amounted to - 10 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the marsh assimilated 130 gC m(-2) during the 2007 growing season. Our study is the first to quantify the effects of tidal inundation on marsh plants, which caused anywhere from 3% to 91% reductions in atmospheric carbon fluxes, with a mean reduction of 46 +/- 26%, when compared to non-flooded conditions.

TI  - Optimal soil carbon sampling designs to achieve cost-effectiveness: a case study in blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers are increasingly studying carbon (C) storage by natural ecosystems for climate mitigation, including coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems. Unfortunately, little guidance on how to achieve robust, cost-effective estimates of blue C stocks to inform inventories exists. We use existing data (492 cores) to develop recommendations on the sampling effort required to achieve robust estimates of blue C. Using a broad-scale, spatially explicit dataset from Victoria, Australia, we applied multiple spatial methods to provide guidelines for reducing variability in estimates of soil C stocks over large F. areas. With a separate dataset collected across Australia, we evaluated how many samples are needed to capture variability within soil cores and the best methods for extrapolating C to 1 m soil depth. We found that 40 core samples are optimal for capturing C variance across 1000's of kilometres but higher density sampling is required across finer scales (100-200 km). Accounting for environmental variation can further decrease required sampling. The within core analyses showed that nine samples within a core capture the majority of the variability and log-linear equations can accurately extrapolate C. These recommendations can help develop standardized methods for sampling programmes to quantify soil C stocks at national scales.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of Carbon and Nitrogen in Soils of the Barents Sea Coastal Area (Khaypudyrskaya Bay)
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds was determined by the volumetric method in soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes of the Barents Sea (Khaypudyrskaya Bay). Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of C-org varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the C-org/N-tot ratio varied from 10 to 18. Humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments were described in the middle part of the marsh soil profile. In the second group, the contents of C-org was 430-470 g/kg and N-tot 4-7 g/kg. The C-org/N-tot ratio in the surface peat horizons equaled to 64-95 g/kg and decreased by three-seven times in the deeper layers. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded each tide and especially their surface horizons contained more inorganic carbon than any other soils. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varied from 4 to 20% of the total carbon content. Seawater and carbonate-containing rocks could be the source of the inorganic carbon. A correlation was found between the contents of C-org and N-tot in soils and in plant communities growing on these soils. Additional input of C-org and N-tot into marsh soils was due to the living activity of birds and to organic substances in seawater.

TI  - Wetland Loss Patterns and Inundation-Productivity Relationships Prognosticate Widespread Salt Marsh Loss for Southern New England
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marsh is a key defense against, yet is especially vulnerable to, the effects of accelerated sea level rise. To determine whether salt marshes in southern New England will be stable given increasing inundation over the coming decades, we examined current loss patterns, inundation-productivity feedbacks, and sustaining processes. A multi-decadal analysis of salt marsh aerial extent using historic imagery and maps revealed that salt marsh vegetation loss is both widespread and accelerating, with vegetation loss rates over the past four decades summing to 17.3 %. Landward retreat of the marsh edge, widening and headward expansion of tidal channel networks, loss of marsh islands, and the development and enlargement of interior depressions found on the marsh platform contributed to vegetation loss. Inundation due to sea level rise is strongly suggested as a primary driver: vegetation loss rates were significantly negatively correlated with marsh elevation (r (2) = 0.96; p = 0.0038), with marshes situated below mean high water (MHW) experiencing greater declines than marshes sitting well above MHW. Growth experiments with Spartina alterniflora, the Atlantic salt marsh ecosystem dominant, across a range of elevations and inundation regimes further established that greater inundation decreases belowground biomass production of S. alterniflora and, thus, negatively impacts organic matter accumulation. These results suggest that southern New England salt marshes are already experiencing deterioration and fragmentation in response to sea level rise and may not be stable as tidal flooding increases in the future.

TI  - Denitrification in fringing salt marshes of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past century, loading of terrestrial inorganic nitrogen to coastal receiving waters has increased dramatically. Salt marshes, because of their location between upland regions and coastal waters and their recognized role as nutrient transformers, have the potential to ameliorate some of this loading. In the current study, we used core incubations in the laboratory to investigate denitrification rates in high marsh soils from five fringing salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. The marshes showed a wide variety of terrestrial N loading, with rates ranging from 2 to 6037 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Field-collected cores were selected to include both vegetated and bare soils at each marsh, and the six-hour incubations were designed to approximate natural tidal rhythms. Total dissolved nitrogen flux in these marshes ranged between + 1255 and -710 mumol N m(-2) hr(-1), with N-2 gas accounting for the majority of the total N flux (average 76%). Nitrogen gas flux ranged between -375 (nitrogen fixation) and +420 (denitrification) mumol N-2 m(-2) hr(-1). While N-2 gas fluxes were significantly correlated (r = +0.64, p < 0.05) with marsh organic carbon content, we also detected a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.91, P < 0.05) between average N-2 gas fluxes and terrestrial nitrogen loads. Comparison of N-2 gas fluxes in vegetated vs. bare soils indicated a significant (p < 0.05) but variable effect of vegetation on N-2 flux. This field survey shows the potential of New England fringe salt marshes to intercept and transform land-derived nitrogen loads; however, sediment characteristics (e.g., percent of labile organic matter) and plant community structure can significantly affect the capacity of the marsh to process inorganic nitrogen loads. In order to understand the role of salt marshes in buffering coastal N loading, we need a better understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling denitrification and net N losses.

TI  - Diversity of Desulfobacteriaceae and Overall Activity of Sulfate-Reducing Microorganisms in and Around a Salt pan in a Southern California Coastal Wetland
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are key mediators of anaerobic carbon cycling in coastal salt marsh sediments and have been shown to be important decomposer communities even in hypersaline habitats. Understanding how SRB function in various salt marsh habitats (vegetated, salt pans) is crucial to advancing our knowledge of salt marsh function. We compare overall sulfate reducing activity and the diversity of a subset of SRB (Desulfobacteriaceae) in two hypersaline sediments (salt pan and nearby area with desiccated vegetation) with a regularly inundated control site within the Huntington Beach Wetlands (HBW). Biological activity was quantified using radiotracer studies to measure sulfate reduction rates (SRR) with and without carbon amendment. All sites showed enhanced SRR under carbon amendment, suggesting short-term carbon limitation. Unique communities of Desulfobacteriaceae were found in all three sites with increased incidence of halotolerant genotypes in the salt pan. These findings indicate that, despite reduced anaerobic respiratory activity, highly diverse and functional deltaproteobacterial communities exist in salt pan and surrounding hypersaline habitats in coastal salt marshes in southern California.

TI  - Accumulation of soil organic carbon linked to Holocene sea level changes in west Greenland
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in arctic soils may influence the global carbon cycle and be an important feedback mechanism to global climate changes. In order to estimate the carbon stock and accumulation rates at Flakkerhuk on Disko Island in West Greenland, an 1800-ha study area was divided into land cover types using a satellite image. Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh. The study shows the importance of landscape history and age when sampling and evaluating SOC stocks and provides estimates of arctic soil C accumulation rates during Holocene versus present rates.

TI  - Long-Term Carbon Sinks in Marsh Soils of Coastal Louisiana are at Risk to Wetland Loss
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are essential habitats for soil carbon accumulation and burial, which can influence the global carbon budget. Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr(-1), a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget.

TI  - A national approach to greenhouse gas abatement through blue carbon management
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating 'blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon withinAustralia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge.We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.

TI  - Climate Change Impacts on Salt Marsh Blue Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorous Stocks and Ecosystem Services
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationMerging physiological data with ecosystem services valuation provides valuable insights into the impact of climate change in coastal salt marsh systems.Salt marshes are valuable ecosystems, as they provide food, shelter, and important nursery areas for fish and macroinvertebrates, and a wide variety of ecosystem services for human populations. These ecosystem services heavily rely on the floristic composition of the salt marshes with different species conferring different service values and different adaptation and resilience capacities towards ecosystem stressors. Blue carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous stocks are no exception to this, and rely on the interspecific differences in the primary production metabolism and physiological traits. Furthermore, these intrinsic physiological characteristics also modulate the species response to any environmental stressor, such as the ones derived from ongoing global changes. This will heavily shape transitional ecosystem services, with significant changes of the ecosystem value of the salt marshes in terms of cultural, provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, with a special emphasis on the possible alterations of the blue carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous stocks retained in these key environments. Thus, the need to integrate plant physiological characteristics and feedbacks towards the expected climate change-driven stressors becomes evident to accurately estimate the ecosystem services of the salt marsh community, and transfer these fundamental services into economic assets, for a fluid communication of the ecosystems value to stakeholders, decision and policy makers, and environmental management entities.

TI  - Sub-continental-scale mapping of tidal wetland composition for East Asia: A novel algorithm integrating satellite tide-level and phenological features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands, the global hotspots of biodiversity and carbon stocks, are currently experiencing widespread modifications in their composition due to human disturbances and changing climate. Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub -continental-or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.

TI  - Carbon Pools Differ in Source and Temporal Patterns in a Tidal Marsh Creek System of the York River, VA Estuary
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine ecosystems, including tidal marsh creek systems, are hotspots of carbon cycling. Despite their biogeochemical importance, the magnitude and timescales at which carbon concentrations vary in these environments remain poorly characterized. To address this, our study identified temporal patterns in carbon pools in a tidal marsh creek with the goal of identifying their primary drivers. Specifically, we measured concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), water quality parameters, and organic matter source proxies (delta C-13, delta N-15, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)). We collected samples every 2.5 h over a tidal cycle monthly (October 2013-January 2015, intermittently thereafter). We characterized organic matter composition from marsh and estuarine endmembers using samples collected at low and high tides respectively. POC concentrations were highest at high tide (4.21 +/- 0.40 mg/L), whereas DIC concentrations were highest at low tide (24.82 +/- 0.74 mg/L), suggesting that the marsh was a sink for POC and source of DIC. Temporally, DIC concentrations were highest in fall (23.19 +/- 1.30 mg/L); DOC and POC varied little across seasons. We used linear mixed effect models to identify potential processes that explained these temporal patterns. Suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were the best predictors of POC concentrations, while CDOM was the best predictor of DOC, and percent freshwater was the best predictor of DIC (p < 0.001). Results from this study highlight the importance of measuring multiple carbon pools simultaneously, as each pool is influenced by different sources and processes and responds differently to drivers that change at tidal and seasonal timescales.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora alters ecosystem DMS and CH4 emissions and their relationship along interacting tidal and vegetation gradients within a coastal salt marsh in Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora accumulates organic carbon rapidly and can utilize a wide range of potential precursors for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production, as well as a wide variety of methanogenic substrates. Therefore, we predicted that S. alterniflora invasion would alter the relationships between DMS and methane (CH4) fluxes along the interacting gradients of tidal influence and vegetation, as well as the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4. In this study, we used static flux chambers to measure DMS and CH4 fluxes in August (growing season) and December (non-growing season) of 2013, along creek and vegetation transects in an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh. S. alterniflora invasion dramatically increased DMS and CH4 emission rates by 3.8-513.0 and 2.0-127.1 times the emission rates within non-vegetated regions and regions populated with native species, respectively, and significantly altered the spatial distribution of DMS and CH4 emissions. We also observed a substantial amount of variation in the DMS and CH4 fluxes along the elevation gradient in the salt marsh studied. A significant relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was observed, with the CH4 flux passively related to the DMS flux. The correlation between CH4 and DMS emissions along the vegetation transects was more significant than along the tidal creek. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, the relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was more significant than within any other salt marsh. Additionally, CH4 emissions within the S. alterniflora salt marsh were more sensitive to the variation in DMS emissions than within any other vegetation zone. The spatial variability in the relationship observed between DMS and CH4 fluxes appears to be at least partly due to the alteration of substrates involved in DMS and CH4 by S. alterniflora invasion. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, methanogenesis was more likely to be derived from noncompetitive substrates than competitive substrates, but within the creek and other vegetation zones, methanogenesis was inhibited by sulfate reduction. This suggests that methanogenesis and sulfate reduction were spatially isolated within the coastal salt marsh. Therefore, we conclude that the invasive S. alterniflora altered the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4 and the responses of the relationship between these two gases to interacting gradients of tidal inundation and vegetation within an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh.

T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Note
AB  - A microbial assay and in-source pyrolysis mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate a shift in the characteristics of sestonic particulate organic matter after tidal inundation of a coastal salt marsh in the southwest Netherlands. Analysis of seston samples collected from the main tidal creek of the marsh during a series of tidal cycles showed that an increase in microbial degradability accompanied a more pronounced lipid character of the seston after inundation. No evidence was found that the halophyte vegetation contributed to the efflux of particulate organic matter from the marsh, indicating that the vegetation of the poorly flooded European Atlantic salt marshes may be a minor contributor of particulate organic matter to adjacent bodies of water.

TI  - Effects of salinity on soil bacterial and archaeal community in estuarine wetlands and its implications for carbon sequestration: verification in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils from two typical tidal salt marshes with varied salinity in the Yellow River Delta wetland were analysed to determine possible effects of salinity on soil carbon sequestration through changes in soil microbiology. The mean soil respiration (SR) of the salt water-fresh water mixing zone (MZ) was 2.89 times higher than that of the coastal zone (CZ) (4.73 and 1.63molm(-2)s(-1), respectively, p<.05), and soil dehydrogenase activity was the main microbial factor influencing SR. In addition to the higher soil microbial biomass, the MZ had more -Proteobacteria than the CZ, as well as some specific bacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity such as Pseudomonas sp. and Limnobacter sp. that might have led to its higher dehydrogenase activity and respiratory rates. Additionally, the CZ possessed more Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with the ability to fix CO2 than the MZ. Significantly lower soil salinity in MZ (4.25gkg(-1)) was suitable for -Proteobacteria, but detrimental for Halobacteria compared with CZ (7.09gkg(-1), p<.01), which might lead to the lower microbial decomposition capacity of soils in CZ. As a result, the CZ has a higher soil organic carbon content than the MZ.

CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - Two of the greatest problems in coastal waters are eutrophicaton and rapid decline in populations of important fish species. Salt marshes are important in combating both these problems. A paradigm for salt marsh function: marshes import inorganic nutrients and export organic nutrients and, as a result, grow fish. As ground and tidal water flow through salt-water wetlands, plants, bacteria and algae produce or transform the organic matter of the food chain that supports fish and shelltish populations. While salt marshes modify the principal plant nutrients, N and P, some of the pathways result in removal of nutrients from biologically active systems. Nitrogen is removed primarily either by being trapped in refractory organic matter that contributes to marsh maintenance through accretion or through loss to the atmosphere (as N(2)) by denitrification. Salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of the United States have changed during the past century; the number of hectares has declined and the nutrient loading per hectare has increased. We examine data on the correlation between fish catch and various marsh features from Long Island, New York in 1880. We review research on the ways salt marshes reduce both the level and rate of eutrophication of coastal waters by intercepting nitrate in discharging groundwater. Finally, we consider how these functions have changed with the decrease in area of salt marshes along the Atlantic coast from Georgia to Maine.

There is a relationship between the slope of the linear upper part and CEC [cation exchange capacity]. A similar relation was found between the slope and the percentage of clay content. Na application, removal and sample storage have no effect on the Na-Q/I relation. Organic matter oxidation increases the slope of the Q/I relation. The Na Q/I relation is a tool that can be used for evaluating the Na status in soils.

TI  - Soil development under different cropping systems in a reclaimed coastal soil chronosequence
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of reclaimed coastal soils under cultivation has not been well understood. In this study, we analyzed major soil chemical properties under two cropping systems (rice-barley vs. cotton-barley cropping systems) along a 60-year soil chronosequence created by intermittent reclamation of coastal salt marshes in Shangyu, Zhejiang Province of China. Soil horizons were identified and selected pedogenic properties such as soil salinity, pH, organic carbon (Sac), nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were used to characterize the horizons. Results showed that the soil profiles with 36-year or longer cultivation durations included the soil horizon arrangement of A-B-C, while those with 28-year or shorter cultivation durations had the soil horizon arrangement of A-C. The paddy soil profiles showed the plow pan and redoximorphic features with rice-barley cropping system, but the upland soil profiles did not show redoximorphic features and a distinct plow pan with cotton-barley cropping system. Rice-barley cropping system significantly increased the contents of SOC, nitrogen, diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-Mn, DTPA-Zn, and DTPA-Cu in 0-20 cm soil depth, but significantly decreased soil pH, salinity and potassium in 0-20 cm soil depth. The chronosequence of soil development was obvious in terms of increasing the contents of SOC, nitrogen, phosphorus, DTPA-Mn, DTPA-Zn, and DTPA-Cu with cultivation time, and decreasing soil pH, salinity, and the contents of potassium, total Mn, total Zn and total Cu with cultivation time except for no obvious decreases of total Cu in the cotton-barley cropping systems. Thirty-six years of cultivation history seemed to be long enough to differentiate paddy profiles with rice-barley cropping system from upland ones with cotton-barley cropping system in terms of soil pH, salinity, and SOC contents. Therefore, the direction and intensity of soil development undergone by the reclaimed soils depend not only on their natural characteristics but also on the way and time that they are managed after land reclamation. The results of this work could be helpful for management plans in reclaimed coastal areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This study was done to evaluate natural organic matter degradation rates by microbes from Louisiana marsh soil and sediments that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Native soil and sediments with differing oiling histories have been characterized from these marshes since 2010 as part of the Coastal Waters Consortium research agenda (http://cwc.lumcon.edu/). Push-core samples from both 0-1 cm and 9-10 cm depths were used for laboratory microcosm experiments; samples were acquired in 2013. Spartina alterniflora leachate was used to represent fresh natural organic matter. Soil and sediments were amended with plant leachate and the fastest organic matter degradation rates were from more heavily oiled soils. Compositional changes in the bacterial communities were assessed from the native material and experimental microcosms based on amplicon pyrosequences libraries of single-direction reads generated from multiplexed, bar-coded primers targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The findings are being used to evaluate large-scale changes in microbial communities from the marshes as part of the CWC longitudinal studies since the DWH oil spill.

TI  - DISSOLVED HUMIC SUBSTANCES OF VASCULAR PLANT-ORIGIN IN A COASTAL MARINE-ENVIRONMENT
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial decomposition of vascular plant detritus in coastal wetlands results in the conversion of particulate organic matter to dissolved form and causes the release of humic substances into the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. We found that 34% of the DOC accumulating during degradation of salt marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) from coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S. fits the definition of humic substances and that lignin is the primary source of the dissolved humic substances (66% of the total). Although marine bacterioplankton used the lignin-rich humic substances more slowly and less efficiently than other components of the DOC pool. a significant fraction (24%) of these substances was mineralized within 7 weeks. Concentrations of vascular plant biomarkers (lignin phenols) indicate that 11-75% of the dissolved humic substances on the southeastern U.S. continental shelf is from vascular plant-dominated environments, Calculations indicate that about half this material is contributed by the coastal salt marshes and half by river export. Vascular plant influence was lower in the bulk DOC pool (2-38%). indicating that terrestrially derived material is harbored preferentially in the humic substances subcomponent of marine DOC.

TI  - Fungi drive soil multifunctionality in the coastal salt marsh ecosystem.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive intertidal wetlands located in temperate climatic zones, in which marine-to-terrestrial transition significantly influences microbial life. Numerous studies revealed the important coupling relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems, however, the importance of microbial diversity in maintaining soil functions in coastal ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the shifts of microbial communities and soil multifunctionality (SMF; nine functions related with C, N and P cycling) along a vegetation gradient in a salt marsh ecosystem and investigated the microbial diversity - ecosystem function relationship. The aboveground vegetation shifted from mud flat (MF) to Scirpus triqueter (SM) and then Phragmites australis (PA) with increasing distance away from the sea. Average approach showed that the SMF was much higher in halophytes covered zones including SM and PA than in MF. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis confirmed that vegetation was an important predictor on SMF besides moisture and organic carbon. Linear regression and multiple threshold methods showed that in MF and SM zones, fungal rather than bacterial richness was significantly and positively correlated with SMF, while in the PA zone microbial diversity did not relate with SMF. Random forest analysis identified several Ascomycota taxa with preference over marine environment as strong predictors of SMF. Taken together, our study lays the basis for a better understanding on the relationships between belowground microbial diversity and soil functions in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen storage in recently restored and mature native Scirpus marshes in the Yangtze Estuary, China: Implications for restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of research into the re-establishment of the native species Scirpus mariqueter in the salt marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, the roles of revegetation mode (planting density), site characteristics (sediment texture and hydrological regime) and community age (recently restored and mature marshes) in the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) were examined. In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

TI  - Onset of runaway fragmentation of salt marshes
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are valuable but vulnerable coastal ecosystems that adapt to relative sea level rise (RSLR) by accumulating organic matter and inorganic sediment. The natural limit of these processes defines a threshold rate of RSLR beyond which marshes drown, resulting in ponding and conversion to open waters. We develop a simplified formulation for sediment transport across marshes to show that pond formation leads to runaway marsh fragmentation, a process characterized by a self-similar hierarchy of pond sizes with power-law distributions. We find the threshold for marsh fragmentation scales primarily with tidal range and that sediment supply is only relevant where tides are sufficient to transport sediment to the marsh interior. Thus the RSLR threshold is controlled by organic accretion in microtidal marshes regardless of the suspended sediment concentration at the marsh edge. This explains the observed fragmentation of microtidal marshes and suggests a tipping point for widespread marsh loss.

TI  - Modeled CO2 Emissions from Coastal Wetland Transitions to Other Land Uses: Tidal Marshes, Mangrove Forests, and Seagrass Beds
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sediments of coastal wetlands contain large stores of carbon which are vulnerable to oxidation once disturbed, resulting in high levels of CO2 emissions that may be avoided if coastal ecosystems are conserved or restored. We used a simple model to estimate CO2 emissions from mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and tidal marshes based on known decomposition rates for organic matter in these ecosystems under either oxic or anoxic conditions combined with assumptions of the proportion of sediment carbon being deposited in either oxic or anoxic environments following a disturbance of the habitat. Our model found that over 40 years after disturbance the cumulative CO2 emitted from tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds were 70-80% of the initial carbon stocks in the top meter of the sediment. Comparison of our estimates of CO2 emissions with empirical studies suggests that (1) assuming 50% of organic material moves to an oxic environment after disturbance gives rise to estimates that are similar to CO2 emissions reported for tidal marshes; (2) field measurements of CO2 emissions in disturbed mangrove forests were generally higher than our modeled emissions that assumed 50% of organic matter was deposited in oxic conditions, suggesting higher proportions of organic matter may be exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance in mangrove ecosystems; and (3) the generally low observed rates of CO2 emissions from disturbed seagrasses compared to our estimates, assuming removal of 50% of the organic matter to oxic environments, suggests that lower proportions may be exposed to oxic conditions in seagrass ecosystems. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the fate of wetland sediment carbon in the marine environment after disturbance. Greater knowledge of the distribution, form, decomposition, and emission rates of wetland sediment carbon after disturbance would help to improve models.

TI  - Branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index traces water content along two marsh-soil transects surrounding Lake Qinghai: Implications for paleo-humidity variation
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The BIT index represents the relative abundances of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) and the isoprenoid GDGT, crenarchaeol. While bGDGTs are produced mainly by soil (anaerobic) bacteria, crenarchaeol is known to be a biomarker for aerobic ammonia oxidation by chemolithoauto-trophic Thaumarchaeota, particularly in the open ocean or lakes. Thus, the index in marine and lacustrine settings has been widely used as a proxy for soil input. Here, we have investigated GDGT distribution along two transects extending from the lake shore marsh to upland soils on the NE Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The results show that soil water content (SWC) correlates positively with concentration of bGDGTs and negatively with concentration of crenarchaeol; consequently, there is a significant positive correlation between SWC and the BIT index. Our study highlights a new potential application of BIT as a humidity proxy in loess/soil and peat deposits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Sedimentary Carbon-Sulfur-Iron Interplay - A Lesson From East Anglian Salt Marsh Sediments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the dynamics of the subsurface sulfur, iron and carbon cycles in salt marsh sediments from East Anglia, United Kingdom. We report measurements of pore fluid and sediment geochemistry, coupled with results from laboratory sediment incubation experiments, and develop a conceptual model to describe the influence of bioturbation on subsurface redox cycling. In the studied sediments the subsurface environment falls into two broadly defined geochemical patterns - iron-rich sediments or sulfide-rich sediments. Within each sediment type nearly identical pore fluid and solid phase geochemistry (in terms of concentrations of iron, sulfate, sulfide, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate) are observed in sediments that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Strictly iron-rich and strictly sulfide-rich sediments, despite their substantive geochemical differences, are observed within spatial distances of less than five meters. We suggest that this bistable system results from a series of feedback reactions that determine ultimately whether sediments will be sulfide-rich or iron-rich. We suggest that an oxidative cycle in the iron-rich sediment, driven by bioirrigation, allows rapid oxidation of organic matter, and that this irrigation impacts the sediment below the immediate physical depth of bioturbation. This oxidative cycle yields iron-rich sediments with low total organic carbon, dominated by microbial iron reduction and no methane production. In the absence of bioirrigation, sediments in the salt marsh become sulfide-rich with high methane concentrations. Our results suggest that the impact of bioirrigation not only drives recycling of sedimentary material but plays a key role in sedimentary interactions among iron, sulfur and carbon.

TI  - Denitrification potential of marsh soils in two natural saline-alkaline wetlands
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little information is available on denitrification potential of marsh soils in natural saline-alkaline wetlands. The denitrification potentials of an open wetland in the floodplain (Erbaifangzi wetland) and a closed wetland (Fulaowenpao wetland) in backwater areas in Jilin Province of Northeast China were monitored by an anaerobic incubation at 30A degrees C for 25 days. Our results showed that the relative denitrification index (RDI) increased gradually with incubation time, and showed a rapid increase in the first 5 days of incubation. The RDI values declined quickly from surface soils to subsurface soils and then kept a small change in deeper soils along soil profiles over the incubation time. Denitrification proceeded much faster in the top 20 cm soils of open wetland than in the closed wetland, whereas no significant differences in RDI values were observed in deeper soils between both wetlands. The RDIs were significantly negatively correlated with bulk density and sand content, while a significantly positive correlation with clay content, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous. The maximum net NO3 (-)-N loss through denitrification in 1 m depth were higher in the open wetland than the closed wetland with higher soil pH values. Future research should be focused on understanding the influencing mechanisms of soil alkalinity.

TI  - Hydrogeomorphic influences on salt marsh sediment accumulation and accretion in two estuaries of the US Mid-Atlantic coast
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes in two contrasting estuaries of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast, Barnegat Bay and Delaware Bay, were investigated to identify relationships between rates of sedimentation and marsh estuarine geomorphic setting. Barnegat Bay is a microtidal lagoon estuary with back-barrier and mainland coastal marshes, whereas Delaware Bay is a micro-mesotidal coastal plain estuary with sediment-rich estuarine marshes. Salt marshes of both estuaries are dominated by Spartina alterrallora. An analysis was performed to characterize marsh hypsometry and tidal flooding characteristics, and a coring study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment accumulation, organic matter accumulation, and vertical accretion using Cs-137 and Pb-210 chronology at nine sites in both estuaries. Mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation rates were significantly higher in Delaware Bay marshes (sediment mean and 1 sigma. 2.57 +/- 2.03 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.65 +/- 0.26 kg m(-2) year(-1)) than in Barnegat Bay (sediment: 0.31 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.29 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) year(-1)), as were rates of accretion (Delaware Bay: 0.79 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1); Barnegat Bay: 0.28 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1)). Regression analysis indicated that marsh accretion rates were positively correlated with rates of sediment and organic accumulation, but the upper limit of accretion was governed by sediment accumulation. Tidal flooding frequency and duration did not correlate with marsh accumulation or accretion rates in either estuary, suggesting that hydroperiod is subordinate to sediment availability in governing rates on 50-100 year time scales. If true, natural and (or) human influences on suspended-sediment production and transport in these estuaries has potential to impact marsh accretionary status and stability, independent of sea-level rise.

TI  - Spatial variability of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores in two natural plant communities
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostatistical techniques were used to assess the spatial patterns of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils from two contrasting plant communities: a salt marsh containing only arbuscular mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants in a distinct clumped distribution pattern and a maquis with different types of mycorrhiza where most plants were relatively randomly distributed. Also evaluated was the relationship between the spatial distribution of spores and AM plant distribution and soil properties. A nested sampling scheme was applied in both sites with sample cores taken from nested grids. Spores of AMF and soil characteristics (organic matter and moisture) were quantified in each core, and core sample location was related to plant location. Semivariograms for spore density indicated strong spatial autocorrelation and a patchy distribution within both sites for all AM fungal genera found. However, the patch size differed between the two plant communities and AM fungal genera. In the salt marsh, AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with distance to AM plants and projected stand area of AM plants. In maquis, spatial AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with organic matter. These results suggest that spore distribution of AMF varied between the two plant communities according to plant distribution and soil properties.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes on organic carbon acquisition in intertidal zones of Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora was planted in the Jiangsu Province, China, in 1982; however, its effects on ecological processes in the local intertidal ecosystem are not well understood. To estimate the effects of S. alterniflora salt marshes on the intertidal zones of Jiangsu Province, the following work was done: (1) the area of S. alterniflora salt marsh expansion from 1985 to 2004 was obtained, as was the total net primary production (TNPP) and CO2 fixation of the salt marshes, (2) bulk density and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the S. alterniflora salt marshes and in mudflats were determined, and (3) total soil organic carbon in the top 20 cm of sediment (TSOC) in S. alterniflora salt marshes and mudflats was estimated and compared.During the past 22 years, the area of S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province increased by 1875 times. Accordingly, the total net primary production (TNPP) of the S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province added up to 3760 million kg, and CO2 fixed by the S. alterniflora salt marshes amounted to 3130 million kg over the 22 years. A significant difference was found between bulk density in three research sites (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA), and the SOC in S. alterniflora salt marshes was significantly higher than that in mudflats (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA). TSOC in 2004 was 247 million kg in S. alterniflora salt marshes and 164 million kg in mudflats, indicating that 83 million kg of organic carbon was sequestrated into the soil pool because of planting S. alterniflora. These results imply that S. alterniflora enhanced the carbon sink capacity of the intertidal ecosystem in the Jiangsu Province, positive contribution to alleviating CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pacific Estuarine Ecosystem Indicators Research Consortium seeks to develop bioindicators of toxicant-induced stress and bioavailability for wetland biota. Within this framework, the effects of environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43% of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs. The strong relationships observed between pollutant concentrations and some of the microbial indicators indicated the potential for using microbial community analyses in assessments of the ecosystem health of salt marshes.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of Carbon and Nitrogen in Soilsof Barents Sea Coastal Area (the Khaypudyrskaya Bay)
T2  - Eurasian Soil Science
M3  - Article
AB  - In soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes along the Barents sea (Khaypudyrskaya bay) the total carbon and nitrogen content was measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds - by the volumetric method. Two groups of soils were specified. The first group includes saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group includes soils of tundra ecosystems, which are affected by the precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of Corg varies by horizons from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total - from 1 to 5 g/kg, the ratio of Corg/N total - from 10 to 18. In the middle part of the marsh soil profile, humus-accumulative horizons buried by recent marine sediments were recorded. In the second group, the content of C org is 430-470 g/kg, N total - 4-7g/kg. The Corg/N total ratio in the surface peat horizons equals 64-95 g/kg, and it decreases by 3-7 times with the depth. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded at each tide, more than any other soils, contain inorganic carbon, and their surface horizon < specifically. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varies between 4 and 20% of the total carbon content. Sea water and carbonate-containing rocks might be the source of the inorganic carbon. The correlation between the content of C org and N total in the soils and in plant communities growing on them was revealed. Obvious is the inflow of C org and N total into soil owing to birds and organic substances in sea waters.

AB  - 1. In many coastal salt marshes. water transparency is decreased by the resuspension of sediments. We analyse the influence of suspended not-photosynthetic matter on the regulation of phosphorus (P) dynamics in the water column., compared with the role of phytoplankton and sediments.2. Field surveys and manipulative experiments of P enrichment in light and dark enclosures, open and closed at their bottom, were performed in the brackish Lake Alimini Grande (Otranto, LE, Italy).3. Water transparency in Alimini Grande was inversely related to seston organic mass. 98.8% of which was composed of dead organic matter and heterotrophic organisms.4. P enrichment experiments showed an increase of the phytoplankton biomass with time from the beginning of the manipulation (4.9 times) in the light enclosures. but also an exponential decrease of P concentration in all the enclosures, even in the dark one closed at the bottom.5. The rate of P removal from the water column was not significantly affected by phytoplankton activity, even though P concentration was always lower in light than in dark enclosures, or by the activity of sediments.6. Dead suspended organic matter with associated micro-organisms seemed to remove nutrients very efficiently from the water column in Lake Alimini Grande, contributing significantly to control the potential risk of lake eutrophication.

TI  - Removal of methyl chloroform in a coastal salt marsh of eastern China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH3CCl3 emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3. Our observations have important implications for estimation of the tropospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 and global OH concentration from the global budget concentration of CH3CCl3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Refractory organic matter in coastal salt marshes-effect on C sequestration calculations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The age and ability of salt marshes to accumulate and sequester carbon is often assessed using the carbon isotopic signatures (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) of sedimentary organic matter. However, transfers of allochthonous refractory carbon (C-RF) from the watershed to marshes would not represent new C sequestration. To better understand how refractory carbon (C-RF) inputs affect assessments of marsh age and C sequestration, Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of both total organic carbon (TOC), C-RF, and non-C-RF organic matter fractions were measured in salt marshes from four contrasting systems on the North Atlantic coast. To our knowledge, no salt marsh sediment study has considered refractory or allochthonous carbon in carbon budget calculations or the impact on chronologies. Stable and radiogenic isotope data suggest that while TOC was dominated by autochthonous plant inputs, C-RF was dominated by locally recycled or allochthonous C, the delivery of which was controlled by the size and slope of each watershed. Steep-gradient rivers analyzed delivered Delta C-14-depleted C-RF to their estuarine marshes, while the site located in the low-gradient river was associated with larger C-RF content. Finally, the marsh isolated from riverine input contained the least fraction of TOC as C-RF. Laterally transported C-RF caused only a small offset in Delta C-14 in relation to TOC in low-gradient systems (average Delta C-14 offset was -44.4 and -24.2 parts per thousand at each location). However, the presence of allochthonous Delta C-14-depleted C-RF in sediments of steep-gradient rivers led to large overestimates of the time of organic matter deposition (i.e. apparent age was older than the 'true' time of deposition) (Delta C-14 offset ranged from -170.6 to -528.9 parts per thousand). Further, reliance on TOC or loss on ignition analyses to calculate C sequestration by marshes might produce overestimates of at least as much as 10 to 20% since neither account for the lateral transport of allochthonous carbon.

TI  - Variation in ecosystem carbon dynamics of saltwater marshes in the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems that can sequester large quantities of carbon. However, variation in physiological potential can alter their capacity to sequester carbon. To examine variation in ecosystem physiological capacity, we established three coastal marsh sites in Mississippi and Alabama spanning a productivity gradient. Over 1 year, we measured ecophysiological activity and spectral indices in two vegetation zones within each marsh to develop a better understanding of variation in ecosystem responses and health. Gross ecosystem exchange of carbon and ecosystem respiration rates (R-eco) differed significantly among sites, with the highest activity at Grand Bay, Mississippi and Point Aux Pines, Alabama and lower ecophysiological activity at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Net ecosystem exchange was similar for all three study areas because greater carbon assimilation was negated by higher levels of respiration. Spectral indices and leaf area were significantly different by marsh vegetation zone, suggesting that alterations in species composition and plant productivity can have important implications for carbon sequestration. While limited to 1 year, this study establishes a foundation by which to evaluate future research conducted over greater temporal and spatial scales, thereby enhancing our understanding of marsh physiological activity.

TI  - Effects of alternate flooding-drought conditions on degenerated Phragmites australis salt marsh in Northeast China
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological regime is the dominant factor associated with the degradation and restoration of inland salt marshes in Northeast China. This study investigates whether alternate flooding-drought conditions could be used to actively restore degraded inland salt marshes with the native plant Phragmites australis. Pot experiments were designed to examine changes in the growth and physiology of P. australis, as well as the saline-alkaline soil characteristics, in response to different hydrological regimes, alternate flooding-drought treatments, and single treatments of moisture, flooding, and drought. After 4 months of treatments, the P. australis population that grew in alternate flooding-drought conditions exhibited substantially more biomass accumulation and less Na+ absorption compared with the single treatments of moisture, flooding, and drought. Photosynthesis physiology served as regulating and adaptive responses to different water regimes, with increased values after the short-term flooding, long-term drought, and flooding-drought cycles. In addition, the saline-alkaline soil properties changed in response to the flooding-drought cycles. The flooding-drought cycles increased organic matter and total nitrogen contents, but decreased pH, electrical conductivity, and saline ion levels. Plant growth and saline-alkaline soil were improved by flooding-drought cycles (not drought-flooding cycles), which suggests that this may be an effective approach for restoration inland salt marshes.

TI  - Sulfate reduction processes in salt marshes affected by phosphogypsum: Geochemical influences on contaminant mobility
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfate reduction and its associated contaminant immobilization in marsh soils supporting a phosphogypsum stack was examined by pore-water and solid analysis, selective extractions, microscopy and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The negative impact of this stack on estuarine environments is a concerning problem. In the weathering profile, total concentrations of most pollutants increase with depth; instead, dissolved contents in pore-waters increase to middle of the saturated zone but then decrease drastically down to reach the marsh due to sulfide precipitation. Excess of acid-volatile sulfide plus pyritic sulfur over metals bound to the oxidizable fraction indicates that sulfide precipitation is the main mechanism responsible for metal removal in the marsh. Thus, abundant pyrite occurred as framboidal grains, in addition to other minor sulfides of As, Zn and Cu as isolated particles. Moreover, high contents of elemental sulfur were found, which suggest partial sulfide oxidation, but marsh may have capacity to buffer potential release of contaminants. The importance of sulfur species was quantitatively confirmed by XANES, which also supports the accuracy of selective extraction schemes. Accordingly, managing pore-water quality through organic carbon-rich amendments over phosphogypsum stacks could lead to a decrease in contaminant loading of leakages resulting from weathering.

TI  - Climate change mitigation potential of wetlands and the cost-effectiveness of their restoration
T2  - INTERFACE FOCUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 +/- 19.13 gC m(-2) y(-1)) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 +/- 100.6 gCO(2) eq(-1) m(-2) y(-1)). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora Invasion Alters Carbon Exchange and Soil Organic Carbon in Eastern Salt Marsh of China
T2  - CLEAN-Soil Air Water
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated carbon (C) fluxes from Spartina alterniflora community comparing with native C-3-plant (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) communities as well as mudflat in a coastal marsh in eastern China by determining the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and soil respiration (R-SOIL) monthly with static chambers over one year. Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R-ECO and R-AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP. The invasion of S. alterniflora potentially induces a negative feedback to the global climate change by regulating the C sequestration in salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - The impact of herbivores on nitrogen mineralization rate: consequences for salt-marsh succession
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil net N-mineralization rate was measured along a successional gradient in salt-marsh sites that were grazed by vertebrate herbivores, and in 5-year-old exclosures from which the animals were excluded. Mineralization rate was significantly higher at ungrazed than at grazed sites. In the absence of grazing, mineralization rate increased over the course of succession, whereas it remained relatively low when sites were grazed. The largest differences in mineralization rate between grazed and ungrazed sites were found at late successional stages where grazing pressure was lowest. The amount of plant litter was significantly lower at grazed sites. In addition, the amount of litter and potential litter (non-woody, live shoots) was linearly related to net N-mineralization rate. This implies that herbivores reduced mineralization rate by preventing litter accumulation. Bulk density was higher at grazed salt-marsh sites than at ungrazed sites. This factor may also have contributed to the differences in net N-mineralization rate between grazed and ungrazed sites.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao

AB  - To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on methane emission from coastal salt marsh, three S. alterniflora invasive levels were established nearby Taizhou City of Zhejiang Province, including native community, mixed community with S. alterniflora and native weeds, and mono-community of S. alterniflora. The results showed that the CH4 flux in the three communities ranged from 0.68 to 5.88 mg . m(-2) . h(-1), and CH4 flux increased significantly with S. alterniflora invasion. CH4 flux in the mono-community of S. alternflora being 8.7 and 2.3 times as that in the native and mixed communities, respectively. S. alternflora invasion increased significantly methanogens number, methane production potential, methanotrophs number, methane oxidation potential, plant biomass, soil organic carbon content and soil pH, but decreased significantly soil total nitrogen content. The correlation analysis showed that the CH4 flux was positively related to methanogens number, methane production potential, methanotrophs number, methane oxidation potential, plant biomass and soil pH, but negatively related to soil total nitrogen content. Overall, our results suggested that S. alternflora invasion improved plant biomass production and soil pH, resulting in the increases in methanogens number and methane production potential to further drive soil CH4 emission.

TI  - Salt Marsh Hydrogeology: A Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Groundwater-surface water exchange in salt marsh ecosystems mediates nearshore salt, nutrient, and carbon budgets with implications for biological productivity and global climate. Despite their importance, a synthesis of salt marsh groundwater studies is lacking. In this review, we summarize drivers mediating salt marsh hydrogeology, review field and modeling techniques, and discuss patterns of exchange. New data from a Delaware seepage meter study are reported which highlight small-scale spatial variability in exchange rates. A synthesis of the salt marsh hydrogeology literature reveals a positive relationship between tidal range and submarine groundwater discharge but not porewater exchange, highlighting the multidimensional drivers of marsh hydrogeology. Field studies are heavily biased towards microtidal systems of the US East Coast, with little global information available. A preliminary estimate of marsh porewater exchange along the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Bights is 8-30 x 10(13) L y(-1), equivalent to recirculating the entire volume of seawater overlying the shelf through tidal marsh sediments in similar to 30-90 years. This review concludes with a discussion of critical questions to address that will decrease uncertainty in global budget estimates and enhance our capacity to predict future responses to global climate change.

TI  - Fate and effects of heavy metals in salt marsh sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The fate and effects of selected heavy metals were examined in sediment from a restored salt marsh. Sediment cores densely covered with Spartina patens were collected and kept either un-amended or artificially amended with nickel (Ni) under standardized greenhouse conditions. Ni-amendment had no significant effect on the fate of other metals in sediments, however, it increased root uptake of the metals. Metal translocation into the shoots was small for all metals. Higher Ni concentrations in plants from amended cores were accompanied by seasonal reductions in plant biomass, photosynthetic capacity and transfer efficiency of open photosystem II reaction centers; these effects, however, were no longer significant at the end of the growing season. Root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) resembled that of natural salt marshes with up to 20% root length colonized. Although Ni-amendment increased AMF colonization, especially during vegetative growth, in general AMF were largely unaffected. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, sediment cores were collected from two areas and used to determine the influence of mangrove migration and deforestation on sediment carbon stocks and accumulation rates. The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1). The total sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) accumulation rates for the period after mangrove deforestation (2005-2011) exhibited significant differences between preserved areas (Core C: 43.9 +/- 6.9 g m(-2) yr(-1); Core D: 83.1 +/- 5.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the deforested area (Core B: 25.8 +/- 6.0 g m(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting a decline after deforestation. For the preserved area, the TOC accumulation under mangrove dominance (65.5 +/- 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), after 1944) was higher than under saltmarsh dominance (23.5 +/- 15.9 g m(-2) yr(-1,) before 1944), as revealed by carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13). The increase in the TOC accumulation due to mangrove expansion in this New Zealand estuary was conservatively estimated as three-fold higher, and two-fold higher in stocks in comparison to the period when this ecosystem was dominated by non-mangrove vegetation.

AB  - The redox potential (Eh), pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the marsh soils of the Chuwei mangrove, located in the estuarine of the Tansui River in northern Taiwan were monitored for two years (from October 1995 to September 1997). The soils of selected pedons were studied, and the soils were classified based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The soil pH values tended to be neutral due to the impact of seawater on the mangrove marsh. The amounts of organic carbon found in this study area were much less than those generally encountered in the wetland soils of temperate regions in the world. The base saturation percentages of the soils were almost 100%, the exchangeable Na being particularly predominant. The concentrations of various cations of water in this ecosystem were in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ = Ca2+, and those of anions of water were in the order of Cl-> SO42-> NO3- > PO43-. In spite of seasonal flooding changes, highly reduced states (100 to -200 mV of Eh values) existed throughout the two-year study. The spatial and temporal variations of the Eh values of the surface soil (0 - 20 cm) were higher than those of the subsoils (20 - 100 cm). The EC values of the soils from the surface to a depth of 100-cm were generally more than 20 dS/m. The marsh soils of the Chuwei mangrove were, thus, classified as Halic Endoaquents or Halic Fluvaquents.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF SULFATE IN COASTAL SALT MARSH SEDIMENTS WITH HIGH-CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION BY ION CHROMATOGRAPHY: A REVISED METHOD
T2  - INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to elucidate the relationship between sulfate reduction and mineralization of organic matter in coastal sediments, the content of sulfate in sediment samples should be measured. Chloride, sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and phosphate are the standard anions in coastal sediment samples. Ion chromatography (IC) is one of the popularly used techniques for determinations of these anions. However, the peaks of the five anions in the IC system coincide with each other under high chloride conditions when using the normal method. In this article, an improved, highly sensitive method for simultaneous separation and determination of sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and phosphate in the samples with high chloride concentration is established and evaluated by IC. In high concentrations of chloride samples, the effects of eluent concentration on the retention time and separation of other anions are studied. The peaks of these anions can be well separated on an AS11 ion-exchange column by a low concentration of NaOH eluent (10mM). in one injection. Gradient elution is helpful to shorten retention time, especially for phosphate. The method detection limit of sulfate is 0.091mg center dot L1. The recovery of sulfate ranged from 100.5% to 106.8%, when the concentrations of standard solution are close to those of the samples. This technique was validated by determining the content of sulfate and chloride in coastal salt marsh sediment samples.

TI  - Thirty-Year Repeat Measures of Mangrove Above- and Below-Ground Biomass Reveals Unexpectedly High Carbon Sequestration
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems store large quantities of organic carbon for long periods of time. This study explores organic carbon stock change through the first comparative study of radiometric analysis and repeat field measures over a multi-decadal period in a mangrove system. Examining one tall gallery forest of Avicennia marina, and an adjacent interior scrub mangrove of mixed Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum, radiometric analysis estimated a soil organic carbon accumulation rate of 4.3 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall gallery forest and 2.2 +/- 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in a stunted mangrove. Repeat measures of root carbon separated by 30 years estimated an increase of 5.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall forest and 6.63 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the stunted forest-suggesting an underestimate of carbon accumulation by radiometric dating of 15% and 67% in the tall and stunted forest, respectively. A higher carbon stock in the interior forest was attributed to root mass increase, associated with landward mangrove encroachment. Extrapolated to the entire region of NSW we estimate that mangrove encroachment has contributed at least about 1.8 Tg C sequestration over the 70 years for which this has been observed in New South Wales, Australia.

T2  - Plodorodie
M3  - Article
AB  - It is established that alluvial marsh soils differ significantly in agrochemical characteristics and the content and component composition of organic matter depending on genesis, degree of hydromorphism, and agricultural use. Drained alluvial soils formed on shallow and deep peats are characterized by high contents of plant residues (from 23 to 58 t/ha) and easily decomposable organic matter (2.1-2.8 wt %) with the exception for pyrogenic soils. Alluvial silt-peat-gley soils are characterized by a lower content of easily decomposable organic matter, crop residues, and total carbon. All the studied alluvial soils have low contents of mobile phosphorus and potassium forms, except for the plots of cropland (no. 4) and hayfield (no. 5)

TI  - Potential Effect of Bioturbation by Burrowing Crabs on Sediment Parameters in Coastal Salt Marshes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Burrowing crabs are main constituent of estuarine wetlands ecosystems, and provide a variety of ecosystem functions including providing food for waterbirds and fishes, promoting nutrients cycling, and processing sediments deposition. Helice tientsinensis is the dominant crab species which inhabits almost the entire intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta. However, for a long time we ignored the crab bioturbation in this area. We know little about whether crabs have potential effects on sediment environment. Here, we investigated the crab burrow characteristics in three marsh zones, and we also analysed the sediment parameters among crab burrow mounds (chimneys), flats (flat areas between burrows), controls (outside of crab bed) and crab fecal deposit. We found that sediment was softer in crab burrow mounds than in flat and control areas. Higher crab density indicates softer sediment. Crab burrow mounds had saltier soil than the flats. Our results showed that sediment total nitrogen, total carbon and organic matter varied among mounds, flats, controls and crab fecal deposit, which indicated that crab bioturbation have potential effects on sediments redistribution and nutrients cycling. Our study is essential to clear the roles of crabs in ecosystems and will benefit for coastal saltmarsh protection and restoration.

TI  - Short-term nitrogen additions can shift a coastal wetland from a sink to a source of N2O
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes sequester carbon at high rates relative to other ecosystems and emit relatively little methane particularly compared to freshwater wetlands. However, fluxes of all major greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4,and CO2) need to be quantified for accurate assessment of the climatic roles of these ecosystems. Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (via run-off, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater) impact coastal marshes. To test the hypothesis that a pulse of nitrogen loading may increase greenhouse gas emissions from salt marsh sediments, we compared N2O, CH4 and respiratory CO2 fluxes from nitrate-enriched plots in a Spartina patens marsh (receiving single additions of NaNO3 equivalent to 1.4 g N m(-2)) to those from control plots (receiving only artificial seawater solutions) in three short-term experiments (July 2009, April 2010, and June 2010). In July 2009, we also compared N2O and CH4 fluxes in both opaque and transparent chambers to test the influence of light on gas flux measurements. Background fluxes of N2O in July 2009 averaged -33 mu mol N2O m(-2) day(-1). However, within 1 h of nutrient additions, N2O fluxes were significantly greater in plots receiving nitrate additions relative to controls in July 2009. Respiratory rates and CH4 fluxes were not significantly affected. N2O fluxes were significantly higher in dark than in transparent chambers, averaging 108 and 42 mu mol N2O m(-2) day(-1) respectively. After 2 days, when nutrient concentrations returned to background levels, none of the greenhouse gas fluxes differed from controls. In April 2010, N2O and CH4 fluxes were not significantly affected by nitrate, possibly due to higher nitrogen demands by growing S. patens plants, but in June 2010 trends of higher N2O fluxes were again found among nitrate-enriched plots, indicating that responses to nutrient pulses may be strongest during the summer. In terms of carbon equivalents, the highest average N2O and CH4 fluxes observed, exceeded half the magnitude of typical daily net carbon sequestration rates by salt marshes. Thus, anthropogenic additions of nitrate to coasts can substantially alter N2O fluxes from marshes, although substantial temporal variation in these fluxes was observed. To better assess the climatic roles of salt marshes, greenhouse gas emissions need to be studied in the context of chronic nitrogen loads that impact many coastal ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Petroleomic depth profiling of Staten Island salt marsh soil: 2 omega detection FTICR MS offers a new solution for the analysis of environmental contaminants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Staten Island is located in one of the most densely populated regions of the US: the NewYork/NewJersey Estuary. Marine and industrial oil spills are commonplace in the area, causing the waterways and adjacent marshes to become polluted with a range of petroleum-related contaminants. Using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, the hydrocarbon impact on a saltmarsh was assessed at regular intervals down to 90 cm, with several key sampling depths of interest identified for further analysis. Ultrahigh resolution data are obtained by direct infusion (DI) atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) on a 12 T solariX Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR MS) allowing trends in the compositional profile with depth to be observed, such as changes in the relative hydrocarbon intensity and the relative contributions from oxygen- and sulfur-containing groups. These trends may correlate with the timing of major oil spills and leaks of petroleum and other industrial chemicals into the water-ways. The use of gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a 7 T solariX 2XR FTICR MS equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source offers retention time resolved and extensive compositional information for the complex environmental samples complementary to that obtained by DI-APPI. The compositional profile observed using GC-APCI FTICR MS includes contributions from phosphorous-containing groups, which may be indicative of contamination from other anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Radionuclides transfer into halophytes growing in tidal salt marshes from the Southwest of Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are sinks of materials and substances which are released directly into them or transported from rivers that drain the basin. It is usual to find high organic matter loads and fine particles in the sediments. We analyzed radionuclide concentrations ((210)po, Th-230, Th-232, U-234, U-238, Ra-226, Th-228, Ra-228, K-40) in sediments and three different organs (roots, stems and leaves) of three species of halophytes plants (Spartina maritima, Spartina densiflora and Sarcocornia perennis). The study was carried out in two tidal salt marshes, one polluted by U-series radionuclides and another nearby that was unpolluted and was used as a control (or reference) area. The Tinto River salt marsh shows high levels of U-series radionuclides coming from mining and industrial discharges. On the contrary, the unperturbed Piedras River salt marsh is located about 25 km from the Tinto marsh, and shows little presence of contaminants and radionuclides. The results of this work have shown that natural radionuclide concentrations (specially the U-isotopes) in the Tinto salt marsh sediments are one order of magnitude higher than those in the Piedras marsh. These radionuclide enhancements are reflected in the different organs of the plants, which have similar concentration increases as the sediments where they have grown. Finally, the transfer factor (IT) of the most polluted radionuclides (U-isotopes and Po-210) in the Tinto area are one order of magnitude higher than in the Piedras area, indicating that the fraction of each radionuclide in the sediment originating from the pollution is more available for the plants than the indigenous fraction. This means that the plants of the salt marshes are unhelpful as bioindicators or for the phytoremediation of radionuclides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in Ecosystem Nitrogen and Carbon Allocation with Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans) Encroachment into Spartina alterniflora Salt Marsh
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in temperature are expected to facilitate encroachment of tropical mangrove forests into temperate salt marshes, yet the effects on ecosystem services are understudied. Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here, we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment intoSpartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (that is, root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (that is, carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground compartments compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

TI  - Nitrogen Compounds in Soil of Continental Peripheriesof the European Arctic
T2  - Pochvovedenie
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic and mineral nitrogen compounds in marsh and tundra soils of the European sector of Russian Arctic (coastal areas of Barents and Beloye Seas) were studied. Total nitrogen was determined by gas chromatography, non-organic nitrogen compounds - by photometry. Method of liquid chromatography on ion-exchange resins was applied to analyze the composition of hydrolysable amino acids. Mineral compounds compose an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (up to 97%) is represented by organic substances (N<sub>оrg</sub>). The N<sub>оrg</sub> varies in broad ranges both in marsh soils (0.3-15.8 g/kg), and in tundra soils (5-20 g/kg in peat horizons and 0.3-2 g/kg in the mineral ones). The content of N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ in former soils ranges in the interval 5-20, and 30-200 mg/kg in the latter soils. In marsh soils, the nitrates content was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in their upper horizons, and accumulation of N<sub>оrg</sub> on the surface is common in them, although in the subsoils it may also happen, if there are former humus-accumulative horizons buried by recent marine sediments. Accumulation of N<sub>оrg</sub> and N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ above the permafrost was recorded in the peat gleyzem, and within permafrost it occurred in the peat oligotrophic soil. The content of hydrolysable amino acids in soils is 0.6-8 g/kg, which corresponds to 30-60% of soil organic nitrogen and 2-12% of organic carbon. Profile patterns of amino acids N and organic N are similar. The amino acids composition was assessed as homogeneous, and the ratios of most of them as close. The shares of arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleuсine are below 4%, while they vary in the range 5-7% for lysine, valine, proline, serine and treonine, for alanine and leuсine - 10-12%. Down the profile of marsh soils, the share of glycine increases against variations 12 to 20% along with decreasing contributions of asparagines and glutamine amino acids from 11 to 6%. Correlation of N<sub>оrg</sub>, N-\[{\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + }\ and nitrogen of most amino acids with clay content and non-silicate iron compounds was revealed (r = 0.6-0.9). The highest r values were noted for the pairs: dithionite-soluble Fe and nitrogen of treonine and histidine.

TI  - Discontinuities in soil strength contribute to destabilization of nutrient-enriched creeks
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a whole-ecosystem, nutrient addition experiment in the Plum Island Sound Estuary (Massachusetts), we tested the effects of nitrogen enrichment on the carbon and nitrogen contents, respiration, and strength of marsh soils. We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing. Additional research is needed, however, to better understand the interactions of nutrient enrichment and sea level rise on soil shear strength and stability of tidal salt marshes.

TI  - Drivers and modelling of blue carbon stock variability in sediments of southeastern Australia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are important global carbon (C) sinks, commonly referred to as coastal "blue carbon". However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30 cm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30 cm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30 cm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30 cm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46% of the variability in 30 cm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million Mg C stored in the top 30 cm of sediments in coastal blue C ecosystems in Victoria, 88% of which was contained within four major coastal areas due to the extent of blue C ecosystems (similar to 87% of total blue C ecosystem area). Regionally, these data can inform conservation management, paired with assessment of other ecosystem services, by enabling identification of hotspots for protection and key locations for restoration efforts. We recommend these methods be tested for applicability to other regions of the globe for identifying drivers of sediment C stock variability and producing predictive C stock models at scales relevant for resource management.

TI  - Impact of tidal inundation on the net ecosystem exchange in daytime conditions in a salt marsh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive ecosystems and yet we have only a preliminary understanding of how net ecosystem exchange varies on daily and seasonal time scales. We used the eddy-covariance method to examine the behaviour of the net ecosystem exchange as influenced by tidal flooding in daytime conditions in a coastal salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora in Georgia, USA. Two different analyses both found that the net ecosystem exchange was similar to 60% greater during neap high tides than during spring high tides; the largest differences occurred early in the growing season. The effect of tidal flooding varied continuously with the degree to which plants were inundated versus emergent. The total monthly reduction (less negative) in daytime net ecosystem exchange due to flooding was 7-38% and 1-64% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The highest CO2 flux reductions were observed early and during the peak growing season (February, March, April and May) and the lowest during the summer season in both years. Our findings suggest that daytime CO2 flux was reduced (less negative) 20-60% during the peak growing season due to tidal flooding. A better understanding of the impact of seasonal tidal flooding on net ecosystem exchange may allow more sophisticated predictions of how sea level rise will affect marsh function and survival over the coming century.

TI  - Characteristics of organic matter sources from Guadiana Estuary salt marsh sediments (SW Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries are dynamic interfaces between land, rivers and the ocean that play major roles in the global carbon cycle. These coastal wetlands store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC), commonly known as "blue carbon" and excellent places to study C cycling. The Guadiana river estuary is among the most important tidal salt marshes in the South - Iberian coastal margin. Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary OM composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content (TOC) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23% and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) also showed a wide range between -22.4 and -27.0 parts per thousand. A(13)C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic C-13 enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments. Series of nalkanes were found in the range from C-10 to C-31. Carbon preference index ratio (CPI) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C-24-C-31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse OM inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant OM derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments. A well-resolved series of long-chain linear alkyl benzenes (LABs from C-4 to C-22) were recorded in all core sediment samples indicating direct discharge of untreated domestic and/or industrial effluents to the estuary. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more than 3 rings reflects the pyrogenic origin of a portion of the sedimentary OM. This study highlights the importance of different OM sources to the lower Guadiana estuarine sediments and contributes to a better knowledge about its origin, dynamics and fate.

TI  - Optical characterization and distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in soil porewater from a salt marsh ecosystem
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - To characterize chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marsh porewaters and its contribution as a carbon source, optical properties (absorbance, fluorescence indices, 3-dimensional excitation-emission matrices [EEMs]) of soil porewater and surface water were measured in a southern Californian salt marsh. Absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities were higher in porewater than in overlying surface waters, consistent with higher CDOM concentration at depth. Humic-type peaks A and C were observed in EEMs in all samples, and peak M was observed in surface waters and shallow porewater to -5 cm depth. Fluorescence: absorbance (flu:abs) ratios and spectral slopes (S) decreased across the surface interface, and emission peak maxima were red-shifted-changes that are consistent with increasing molecular weight (MW) and aromaticity in soil porewater due to humification, and lower-MW, less aromatic material in oxic surface waters from oxidative photochemical and biological processing. At lower depths, bands were observed where intensity, flu: abs ratios and S increased; absorption coefficients decreased; emission maxima for humic-type peaks were blue-shifted; and tryptophan-type protein peaks were observed. These changes are consistent with lower-MW and less aromatic material from enhanced microbial activity. Variations in iron concentrations and sulfate depletion with depth were consistent with these bands having different dominant anaerobic microbial metabolic pathways. Overall, optical property trends suggest that soil porewater is a reservoir of CDOM in the salt marsh, with organic material from terrestrial watershed inputs and in situ production from marsh vegetation stored and processed in sediments.

TI  - Desorption resistance of organic compounds in wetland soils
T2  - WETLANDS & REMEDIATION: AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Wetlands and Remediation Conference
CL  - SALT LAKE CITY, UT
AB  - Reversible sorption of organic compounds in soils and sediments is a common assumption in assessing risk and determining remedial endpoints. However, the presence of a desorption-resistance phase has been widely reported in the literature. Recent work has suggested that the quality of organic matter is important in the magnitude of the desorption-resistant effect. For example, a series of wetland peats demonstrated little or no desorption resistance for phenanthrene (Huang and Weber, 1997). The goal of the present study was to determine if desorption-resistance is observed in recent deposited organic matter by studying wetland soils explicitly. Sorption/desorption characteristics for both surface marsh soil (top 0-2 cm, <5 years old) and deeper marsh soil (below 10-cm, >20 years old) were investigated to see whether soil age can cause differences in sorption/desorption in wetlands. Sorption-desorption of organic compounds (chlorobenzene and phenanthrene) in recently deposited freshwater marsh soils was determined using the batch desorption procedure of Kan et al. (1998). Adsorption was biphasic with about 30-62% (chlorobenzene) and 46.7-82.9% (phenanthrene) of the adsorbed mass residing in the desorption-resistant fraction after 7-14 desorption steps. Sorption/desorption parameters were determined for several of the currently proposed models for explaining the desorption resistance including the Tomson-Kan model, slow sorption model and dual reactive domain model (DRDM). All models indicated the presence of a sizeable desorption-resistant phase in wetland soils and an increase in the size of the desorption-resistance in "older" organic matter. Implications for wetland remediation are discussed.

TI  - Tidal Marsh Restoration Optimism in a Changing Climate and Urbanizing Seascape
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes (including saltmarshes) provide remarkable value for many social (cultural, recreational) and environmental (fish production, water quality, shoreline protection, carbon sequestration) services. However, their extent, condition, and capacity to support these services are threatened by human development expansion, invasive species, erosion, altered hydrology and connectivity, and climate change. The past two decades have seen a shift toward working with managers to restore tidal marshes to conserve existing patches or create new marshes. The present perspective examines key features of recent tidal marsh restoration projects. Although optimism about restoration is building, not all marshes are the same; site-specific nuances require careful consideration, and thus, standard restoration designs are not possible. Restoration projects are effectively experiments, requiring clear goals, monitoring and evaluation, and adaptive management practices. Restoration is expensive; however, payment schemes for ecosystem services derived from restoration offer new ways to fund projects and appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs. All information generated by restoration needs to be published and easily accessible, especially failed attempts, to equip practitioners and scientists with actionable knowledge for future efforts. We advocate the need for a network of tidal marsh scientists, managers, and practitioners to share and disseminate new observations and knowledge. Such a network will help augment our capacity to restore tidal marsh, but also valuable coastal ecosystems more broadly.

TI  - Assessing the risk of carbon dioxide emissions from blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - "Blue carbon" ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows, have large stocks of organic carbon (Corg) in their soils. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to decomposition and - if degraded - can be released to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. We present a framework to help assess the relative risk of CO2 emissions from degraded soils, thereby supporting inclusion of soil Corg into blue carbon projects and establishing a means to prioritize management for their carbon values. Assessing the risk of CO2 emissions after various kinds of disturbances can be accomplished through knowledge of both the size of the soil Corg stock at a site and the likelihood that the soil Corg will decompose to CO2.

TI  - Effects of a nutrient enrichment pulse on blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from land-derived eutrophication in most developed coastlines worldwide. Here, we tested for 277 days the effects of a nutrient pulse on blue carbon retention and cycling within an Australian temperate coastal system. After 56 days of exposure, saltmarsh and mangrove plots subject to a high-nutrient treatment (-20 g N m? 2 yr? 1 and -2 g P m? 2 yr? 1) had -23% lower superficial soil carbon stocks. Mangrove plots also experienced a -33% reduction in the microbe Amplicon Sequence Variant richness and a shift in community structure linked to elevated ammonium concentrations. Live plant cover, tea litter decomposition, and soil carbon fluxes (CO2 and CH4) were not significantly affected by the pulse. Before the end of the experiment, soil carbon- and nitrogen-cycling had returned to control levels, highlighting the significant but short-lived impact that a nutrient pulse can have on the carbon sink capacity of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Different short-term responses of greenhouse gas fluxes from salt marsh mesocosms to simulated global change drivers
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are valued as important greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks, but global changes in climate, nitrogen (N) pollution, and exotic species invasion may alter this marsh function. With the goal of better understanding the potential responses of coastal marsh GHG fluxes to interacting global changes, a multifactorial experiment was conducted. Two climate treatments (present-day and end-of-century temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations) and two N treatments (non-enriched and simulated eutrophic estuary conditions) were applied to mesocosms containing either invasive Phragmites australis (Cav. Trin. Ex Steud.) or native Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl. vegetated soil cores. Fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in each mesocosm before and after treatment using cavity ring-down spectrometry, along with vegetation growth, edaphic conditions, and pore water chemistry. Methane emissions increased in P. australis but not in S. patens mesocosms under climate change conditions, while CO2 fluxes were similar between vegetation types and treatments. Nitrous oxide emissions increased with N loading from both S. patens and P. australis mesocosms, but were decreased in N-enriched S. patens mesocosms under climate change conditions. These findings demonstrate complex GHG flux responses to global change and suggest the potential for vegetation community-specific responses, though further research is needed to test mechanisms underlying observed GHG flux patterns.

TI  - The structure of salt marsh soil mesofauna food webs - The prevalence of disturbance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesofauna taxa fill key trophic positions in soil food webs, even in terrestrial-marine boundary habitats characterized by frequent natural disturbances. Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats, characterized by frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial upper to the marine pioneer zone. Despite the high abundance of soil mesofauna in salt marshes and their important function by facilitating energy and carbon flows, the structure, trophic ecology and habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural salt marsh habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food web complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope analysis (N-15, C-13) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal habitat, the pioneer zone is exposed to inundations twice a day, but lower and upper salt marshes are less frequently inundated based on shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / taxa dominated by Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and density declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the importance of increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly, the reduced diversity and density was associated by a simplification of the food web in the pioneer zone as compared to the less inundated lower and upper salt marsh with a higher number of trophic levels. Strong variations in delta N-15 signatures demonstrated that mesofauna species are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators including second order predators or scavengers. The results document that major decomposer taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more diverse than previously assumed and predominantly dwell on autochthonous resources of the respective salt marsh zone. The results further suggest that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild predation lifestyle. The high trophic position of a large number of predators suggests that intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh food webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the salt marsh food web against disturbances.

CP  - 4th International Conference on Land Degradation
CL  - Cartagena, SPAIN
AB  - Metal contents in soils and metal uptake in natural occurring vegetation in a metal-polluted salt marsh were investigated to understand metal contamination in a semiarid area of southern Spain suffering from along-history of mining activities. Soil analyses including pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon content and texture were conducted on bulk and rhizosphere samples. In addition, we determined the diethylenetriamene pentaacetate (DTPA)-extracted metals and metal uptake in the natural occurring vegetation. Soils had neutral pH (7) and showed high electrical conductivity (50 dS m(-1)). About 3% of total Zn and Pb were DTPA-extractable while a higher amount (9%) was obtained for Cu. Phragmites australis had the lowest uptake of Pb and Zn, while Stipa ramosissima showed the highest uptake for the same metals. Our study supports earlier studies that halophytic plant species in mine areas can tolerate high levels of metals in soils.

TI  - Maturation of a constructed tidal marsh relative to two natural reference tidal marshes over 12 years
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat functions of a constructed tidal marsh and two adjacent natural tidal marshes were compared between marshes and with similar data collected in the same marshes 7 years earlier. The marshes were sampled for fish. blue crabs, benthic infauna, vegetation community type, stem density and cover, salinity, temperature. dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, and bird utilization. The constructed marsh has progressed to a general level of function similar to that of nearby natural marshes. Some morphological differences remain, such as the differences in community type ratios. Significant differences in habitat function remain in three areas: sediment organic carbon at depth, mature saltbush density. and bird utilization (related to saltbush density), The addition of organic soil amendments and mature saltbush in the construction of tidal marshes will help in the progression of constructed marshes to functional equivalency with natural marshes. Specific functions can be enhanced for fish utilization (more subtidal habitat) and for birds (more shrub habitat) depending on management priorities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - Sediment-dwelling fauna are a ubiquitous component of salt marshes yet we have limited understanding of their roles in marsh functioning and of the environmental conditions that control their distributions and abundances. This paper examines the influence of vegetation (presence, type, density, and biomass) and other environmental variables (marsh age, sediment and porewater properties, elevation, flow, oxygen, and biogenic structures) on salt marsh macrofauna and meiofauna. We review studies from a variety of geographical locations and include new information from systems with adjacent natural and restored sites in southern California. The influence of environmental factors on faunal assemblages varies with marsh system, factor intensity or concentration, taxon studied, and with other interacting factors present. We hypothesize a hierarchy of environmental variables in which abiotic properties such as marsh age, elevation and salinity act over large space and time scales, and are most likely to influence the presence or absence of species. Sediment properties (organic matter and particle size) and vegetation presence or type act on intermediate scales affecting macrofaunal abundance and composition. Plant biomass, culms and biogenic structures generated by fauna are patchy and act on small scales, often interacting with flow, to affect distribution and abundance patterns. Resolution of these processes in salt marshes should improve our understanding of controls on invertebrate communities and will ultimately aid the conservation and restoration of salt marsh habitat.

TI  - Effects of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment on the emission of N2O from a freshwater marsh soil in Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshwater marshes in northern China are heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbances such as cultivation and fertilization and increased levels of nutrients (especially N and P) through atmospheric deposition and agricultural surface runoff. These disturbances have affected the emission of N2O from these systems. This laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of increased inputs of inorganic N and P on N2O emission from marsh soil in response to different soil moisture conditions. The results showed that the emission of N2O increased with the enhancement of N inputs when the soil was submerged, but that the highest N treatment suppressed the emission of N2O when the soil was at 60% water holding capacity (WHC), which may have occurred due to an inadequate amount of available C. Furthermore, the results of this study indicated that a small amount of N fertilizer induced much more N2O evolution from freshwater wetland soil, while P fertilizer inputs appeared to stimulate the emission of N2O only during the first few days of the experiment. Additionally, soil that was treated with P appeared to absorb N2O when it was at 60% WHC after around 6 weeks of the incubation, which indicates that the input of P fertilizer might serve as a shift of source or N2O sink in wetland soils under non-flooded conditions. When compared to soil at 60% WHC, submerged soil had significantly higher N2O emissions, except when subjected to the medial N treatment. These findings indicate that the soil moisture condition had a significant effect on N2O emissions when the same amount of N or P was applied. Therefore, the effects of N and P fertilization in the northern temperate wetlands cannot be neglected from regional or national emissions of N2O.

TI  - Accumulation of soil carbon drives denitrification potential and lab incubated gas production along a chronosequence of salt marsh development
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured sediment organic carbon and nitrogen accumulation and rates of denitrification enzyme activity and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) production from slurries of sediments of a mudflat that formed in 2002, a young (8-year-old) natural Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that developed on part of the mudfiat, and four mature (>200 years old) salt marshes in southeastern Georgia to examine microbial processes related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling during succession from mudflat to mature marsh. Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17 g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8 years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

TI  - Ant mounds alter spatial and temporal patterns of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from a marsh soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogenic structures produced by soil ecosystem engineers mediate soil functions and ecosystem services. Ant mounds are important biogenic structures in marsh wetlands, where they can occur at high densities. However, little information is available on their roles in the C and N cycling in these ecosystems. We measured CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from ant mounds of three different ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida) and estimated their contribution to the total gas emissions of soils from May to September 2010 in a Calamagrostis angustifolia-Carex schmidtii marsh wetland of the Sanjiang Plain, in northeastern China. Average CO2 emissions from ant mounds ranged from 0.84 to 1.95 g CO2 m(-2)h(-1) and were 1.08-3.09 times higher than from the surrounding marsh soils. Soil CO2 emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by mound type and sampling season. On the whole, average soil CO2 emissions from L niger mounds were lower in comparison to those from E candida mounds and L.flavus mounds. Ant mound soils were CH4 sinks (-0.39 similar to -0.19 mg m(-2) h(-1)) while the control marsh soils were CH4 emission sources (0.13-0.76 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Soil CH4 and N2O emissions did not significantly differ among the three different types of ant mounds. Compared with control marsh soils (0.034-0.045 mg m(-2) h(-1)), N2O emissions from ant mounds (0.007-0.13 mg m(-2)h(-1)) were influenced more by sampling season. Overall, ant mounds contributed measurable amounts to soil gas emissions from the wetland, averaging 7.02%, -4.28% and 335% of total soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emission, respectively. Ant mounds also increased the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil gas emissions in the marsh. Thus ant mounds may be important to a complete understanding of wetland ecosystem C and N cycles and balances. Research on more ant species from more ecosystems is needed to establish ant mound impacts on soil gas emissions at a global scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE OF A COASTAL MARSH PLANT HYDROCOTYLE VULGARIS IN NATURAL CONDITIONS IN RELATION TO MINERAL NUTRITION AND MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS
T2  - Proceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences Section B Natural Exact and Applied Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluctuating soil salinity and competition for light are the main factors affecting plant distribution and performance in coastal salt marshes. The aim of the present study was to assess plant performance by means of non-destructive instrumental methods in a highly heterogeneous natural habitat. More specifically, environmental factors affecting growth and physiological performance of a clonal plant Hydrocotyle vulgaris L. were investigated. Changes in soil salinity, soil mineral characteristics, leaf nutrient concentrations, morphological parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and mycorrhizal symbiosis were analysed in different experimental plots of naturally growing H. vulgaris plants. The dynamic nature of interaction between sea water flooding-affected changes in soil salinity and competition-dependent changes in light availability led to micro-environmental heterogeneity differentially affecting physiological performance and growth of H. vulgaris in natural conditions. Plant growth was mostly affected by intensity of photosynthetically active radiation in the respective plots. Increased growth rate in shaded conditions specifically pointed to shade tolerance strategy of H. vulgaris. High heterogeneity of mineral nutrients between the plots was established. However, considerable plasticity of metabolism in respect to highly variable soil concentration of mineral nutrients together with effective mineral adaptation mechanisms ensured optimal supply of material for growth. Photochemistry of photosynthesis was only marginally affected by differences in microenvironmental conditions as shown by respective changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Mycorrhizal symbiosis was stimulated by moderately increasing soil salinity and suppressed by relatively high salinity. When the effect of soil salinity was omitted, intensity of mycorrhizal symbiosis was positively associated with intensity of photosynthetically active radiation. In general, a relatively high stable level of photosynthetic performance across a wide range of micro-environmental conditions indicates an adequate level of physiological adaptation of H. vulgaris to conditions of a coastal salt marsh. The present data clearly reflect complex interactions between environmental factors and plastic physiological responses of H. vulgaris.

T2  - Hacquetia
M3  - Article
AB  - The present phytosociological study of the eastern Adriatic coastal salt-marsh at Blato, Croatia, is based on the Braun-Blanquet approach. Five plant associations were recorded in the area: juncetum maritimo-acuti,Puccinellio festuciformis-Sarcocornietum fruticosae, Scirpetum maritimi, Enteromorpho intestinalidis-Ruppietum maritimae and Cressetum creticae. The association Cressetum creticae was found for the first time in Croatia as well as on the eastern Adriatic coast. This therophytic and halo-nitrophilous association shows a monospecific or paucispecific character and occupies the most haline and the driest parts of the salt-marsh. The association develops during the summer on silty clay substrates with organic matter derived from the decay of plants of the neighboring communities. According to key soil factor analysis no differences of grain size of the soils among the associations were found, while regarding electrical conductivity, Cl- and Na+ concentrations were higher in the Cressetum creticae than in any of the others associations. The particular original features of the site regarding its flora and vegetation would justify some measures of protection and management.

TI  - Evolution of clay minerals in a chronosequence of poldered sediments under the influence of a natural pasture development
T2  - CLAYS AND CLAY MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clay minerals appear to change significantly under the influence of pasture development on poldered sediments in the Baie d'Authie area (Somme, France). Cores 40-90 cm deep from recent salt marsh sediments and poldered sediments developing grass pastures since 1737, 1575 and 1158 indicate that the natural mineral suite of kaolinite, mica, illite, and two disordered mixed-layered illite-smectite (I-S) phases common to the sedimentary input changes gradually but significantly in the materials. In the oldest, best-developed profile, there is a dominance of a disordered, illitic I-S in the humic upper part of the profile and a more abundant, more smectitic I-S mineral below. It appears that grass-derived humic materials tend to stabilize closed (collapsed) or illitic behavior in I-S clays. The natural evolution of the sediment (lower part of the profile) is towards a smectitic clay assemblage. Destruction of organic matter of the smectitic I-S minerals by oxidation indicates that this material can significantly modify the physical behavior of the clays keeping the structure open to polar molecules.

TI  - Environmental significance of atmospheric emission resulting from in situ burning of oiled salt marsh
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental significance of atmospheric emissions resulting from in-situ burning used as remediation technique for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons entering Louisiana coastal salt marshes was quantified. Research conducted documented atmospheric pollutants produced and emitted to the atmosphere as the result of burning of oil contaminated wetlands. Samples collected from the smoke plume contained a variety of gaseous sulfur and carbon compounds. Carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the main volatile sulfur compounds. In contrast, concentrations of sulfur dioxide were almost negligible. Concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide in the smoke plume increased compared to ambient levels. Air samples collected for aromatic hydrocarbons in the smoke plume were dominated by pyrogenic or combustion derived aromatic hydrocarbons. The particulate fi action was nominated by phenanthrene and the C-I and C-2 alkylated phenanthrene homologues. The vapor fr action was dominated bq, naphthalene and the C-l to C-3 naphthalene homologues. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Field Observation of Lateral Detritus Carbon Flux in a Coastal Wetland
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lateral transport of carbon has been increasingly recognized as an important component of carbon budget in wetlands. We studied a typical coastal salt marsh located at the estuary of the Yangtze River by measuring lateral transfer of macro-detritus carbon within a creek during each month's largest spring tide period, and simultaneously, we measured the gross primary production (GPP) by the eddy covariance (EC) method. The results showed a bimodal seasonal pattern of net detritus carbon export, with one peak associated with mainly green/fresh carbon materials and the other peak associated with mainly yellow-dark/senescent carbon materials. We also found that the export of green detritus carbon was highly correlated with plant phenology and the height of tides, suggesting influences from both the standing stock of living biomass and the force of tides. GPP measured by the EC technique (GPP(EC)) and by remote sensing (GPP(RS)) differed substantially. We found this difference was correlated well with the net export of green macro-detritus. In general, we concluded that the lateral flux is an important component of the carbon budget in the marsh and that to cross validate between GPP(EC) and GPP(RS), it must be included as a calibration term for computing GPP(EC).

TI  - Ecological succession reveals potential signatures of marine-terrestrial transition in salt marsh fungal communities
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine-to-terrestrial transition represents one of the most fundamental shifts in microbial life. Understanding the distribution and drivers of soil microbial communities across coastal ecosystems is critical given the roles of microbes in soil biogeochemistry and their multifaceted influence on landscape succession. Here, we studied the fungal community dynamics in a well-established salt marsh chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development. We focussed on providing high-resolution assessments of community composition, diversity and ecophysiological shifts that yielded patterns of ecological succession through soil formation. Notably, despite containing 10- to 100-fold lower fungal internal transcribed spacer abundances, early-successional sites revealed fungal richnesses comparable to those of more mature soils. These newly formed sites also exhibited significant temporal variations in beta-diversity that may be attributed to the highly dynamic nature of the system imposed by the tidal regime. The fungal community compositions and ecophysiological assignments changed substantially along the successional gradient, revealing a clear signature of ecological replacement and gradually transforming the environment from a marine into a terrestrial system. Moreover, distance-based linear modelling revealed soil physical structure and organic matter to be the best predictors of the shifts in fungal beta-diversity along the chronosequence. Taken together, our study lays the basis for a better understanding of the spatiotemporally determined fungal community dynamics in salt marshes and highlights their ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem.

AB  - A net annual budget of nutrients and particulate suspended sediment was assessed in the Fier-d'Ars Bay (French Atlantic Coast). The model indicated a net import of particulate matter with the dominance of mineral form exceeding 90 % of the total particulate matter. Regarding the dissolved nutrient, the bay acted differently: a particular import of DOC and DIN was assessed in the upper part of the bay, whereas an export was indicated at the bay-ocean interface. Negative and positive feedbacks were indicated between water column constituent processing and the geomorphology of the system, the tidal dynamics, the primary producers and the decomposition of the organic matter.

TI  - Root-zone carbon and nitrogen pools across two chronosequences of coastal marshes formed using different restoration techniques: Dredge sediment versus river sediment diversion
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes have among the highest rates of soil carbon accumulation of any ecosystem on Earth, yet they are increasingly being lost due to high rates of relative sea-level rise, changes to their hydrology, and other natural and anthropogenic factors. To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.

TI  - Analyzing ecosystem services as part of ecological networks in three salt marsh ecosystems.
T2  - Ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Biodiversity plays important roles in nature's contributions to people (i.e. ecosystem services), but the critical details of how biodiversity contributes are challenging to determine. Efforts to identify the components of an ecosystem that provide services have improved our understanding of which species, functional groups, population, or habitats directly provide services. However, species do not exist in isolation - and considerably less is known about how species indirectly influence ecosystem services, through interacting with those species directly providing services. This uncertainty is even greater when considering that species interact in complex networks. As such, detailed analysis of species interdependencies are rarely included in ecosystem services assessments or conservation decisions. To date, most studies on food webs and on ecosystem services have developed largely in parallel for many services, but these fields and data are ripe for empirical integration. To further this integration, we compile datasets that link three existing ecological networks to seven ecosystem functions and services: wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization, carbon sequestration, water filtration, fisheries, birdwatching, and waterfowl hunting. We leveraged high-resolution ecological interaction network datasets from three coastal salt marsh ecosystems including detailed species information (e.g. consumer strategy, body size, biomass) on several hundred species from Carpinteria Salt Marsh in California, USA, and for Estero de Punta Banda and Bahia Falsa in Baja, Mexico. Through an extensive literature synthesis and use of citizen science data, we identified which species in the Hechinger et al. (2011) dataset provide each ecosystem services directly. We augmented the Hechinger et al. (2011) dataset published in Ecology, particularly the link (or edge) list to include species - service links - indicating a species providing a service - where species are listed as "Resources" and services are listed as "Consumers." Connecting this data to the previously published ecological networks with species interactions (i.e., trophic, parasitism) forms a topological network with species and service nodes. We also provide a protocol for assigning services to ecological networks that can be used in other ecosystems. This dataset provides a step towards advancing knowledge of important supporting species for ecosystem services and developing new ecological network methods for ecosystem services.

TI  - New insight into global blue carbon estimation under human activity in land-sea interaction area: A case study of China
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The C sequestration in coastal blue carbon (C-b) ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, was discovered to be useful in mitigating the increasing trend of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to climate change. In this study, we systematically estimate traditional C-b ecosystem distribution and the associated C-b sequestration rate, and then further quantify the C-b sinks fishery contribution to C-b ecosystem due to human activity in coastal ecosystem. The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively. In China, the C-b pools are 162 TgC in mangroves, 67 TgC in saltmarshes and 75 TgC in seagrass. The human activity induced global C-b sink fishery on C-b ecosystem is about 26.58-37.6 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 30.7%-43.4% of the world's traditional C-b sequestration ecosystem. The global C-b sequestration potential reaches up to 86.59 Tg yr(-1), while China can explain 1.70% of the world's total C-b sequestration. However, in China, the C-b sequestration due to human activity reaches up to 632-7.89 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 20.9%-23.7% of global C-b sink fishery. Therefore, it is very important to build the C-b sink fisheries measure and monitor system to scientifically valuate C-b sink fisheries and associated development potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using Multispectral Drone Imagery for Spatially Explicit Modeling of Wave Attenuation through a Salt Marsh Meadow
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Offering remarkable biodiversity, coastal salt marshes also provide a wide variety of ecosystem services: cultural services (leisure, tourist amenities), supply services (crop production, pastoralism) and regulation services including carbon sequestration and natural protection against coastal erosion and inundation. The consideration of this coastal protection ecosystem service takes part in a renewed vision of coastal risk management and especially marine flooding, with an emerging focus on "nature-based solutions." Through this work, using remote-sensing methods, we propose a novel drone-based spatial modeling methodology of the salt marsh hydrodynamic attenuation at very high spatial resolution (VHSR). This indirect modeling is based on in situ measurements of significant wave heights (Hm(0)) that constitute the ground truth, as well as spectral and topographical predictors from VHSR multispectral drone imagery. By using simple and multiple linear regressions, we identify the contribution of predictors, taken individually, and jointly. The best individual drone-based predictor is the green waveband. Dealing with the addition of individual predictors to the red-green-blue (RGB) model, the highest gain is observed with the red edge waveband, followed by the near-infrared, then the digital surface model. The best full combination is the RGB enhanced by the red edge and the normalized difference vegetation index (coefficient of determination (R-2): 0.85, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.20%/m).

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the population ecology of the snail Melampus bidentatus in relation to patch composition and landscape structure across several salt marsh systems in Connecticut, USA. These marshes have changed significantly over the past 40-50 years including loss of total area, increased areas of short Spartina alterniflora, and decreased areas and fragmentation of Spartina patens. These changes are consistent with tidal inundation patterns that indicate frequent flooding of high marsh areas. Melampus bidentatus densities were highly variable, both among different salt marsh systems and locations within specific marshes, but were generally similar among short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens patches within locations. Densities were lowest where the marsh was regularly inundated at high tide and only remnant Sp.patens patches remained. Almost no snails were found in bare patches. Areas that had large Sp.patens patches adjacent to short Sp.alterniflora supported the highest M.bidentatus densities. Population size-structure varied significantly among patch types, with higher proportions of large individuals in short Sp.alterniflora and hummocked Sp.patens patches than in large and remnant Sp.patens patches. This was likely due to size-selective predation and/or higher snail growth rates due to better food resource conditions in short Sp.alterniflora patches. Egg mass densities and the number of eggs per egg mass were highest in short Sp.alterniflora. Our results indicate that M.bidentatus is resilient to the level and patterns of salt marsh change evident at our study sites. Indeed, snail densities were significantly higher than reported in other field studies, suggesting that increased patch areas of short Sp.alterniflora and associated environmental conditions at our study sites may provide more favorable habitats than previously when marshes were dominated by extensive Sp.patens meadows. However, there may be threshold conditions that could overwhelm the ability of M.bidentatus to maintain itself within salt marsh systems where changes in hydrology, sedimentation and other factors lead to increased numbers of bare patches and ponds and loss of short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens. Studies of the responses of resident and transient fauna to salt marsh change are critically needed in order to better understand the implications for salt marsh ecosystem dynamics and services.

TI  - On the relationship between iron concentration and induced polarization in marsh soils
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Induced polarization (IP) measurements (0.1-1000 Hz) were conducted on seventeen clay and peat marsh soils that were subsequently analyzed for heavy metal concentrations, moisture content, organic matter, porosity, specific surface area, and pore fluid conductivity. A Cole-Cole model was fit to each sample and model parameters analyzed in terms of physicochemical properties. We found a linear relation between the normalized chargeability (m(n)) and estimated surface area to pore volume (S.) when iron content (ranging from 0.25% to 1.63% by volume) is accounted for as a polarizable element of the soil. In fact, the dependence of m(n) on volumetric Fe concentration per unit volume of the bulk soil is described by a linear relationship with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.94. As Fe concentration is a critical biogeochemical parameter, our findings suggest that IP measurements may provide a hitherto unrecognized approach to probing soil geochemistry, iron cycling and anaerobic microbial activity. Furthermore, our results yield insights into physicochemical controls on IP in natural soils.

TI  - LOSS ON IGNITION AND KJELDAHL DIGESTION FOR ESTIMATING ORGANIC-CARBON AND TOTAL NITROGEN IN ESTUARINE MARSH SOILS - CALIBRATION WITH DRY COMBUSTION
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils (n = 250) were collected from ten salt and brackish-water marshes of North Carolina and analyzed for organic matter content by loss on ignition (LOI) and Kjeldahl nitrogen (KN). Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were determined on the same samples using an elemental CHN analyzer. Regression analyses indicated that LOI and KN were excellent estimators of organic C (R2 = 0.990) and total N (R2 = 0.986), respectively, in low clay content (0-11%) marsh soils containing a wide range of soil organic C (0.1-28%) and total N (0-1.6%). A quadratic equation best described the relationship between organic C and organic matter (Organic C = 0.40 [LOI] + 0.0025 [LOI]2) while a linear model accurately described the relationship between total N and Kjeldahl N (Total N = 1.048 [KN] - 0.010). The proportion of organic C in organic matter (C/OM) increased with increasing soil organic matter content, probably as a result of aging. Young marshes, which are characterized by low soil organic content contain C/OM ratios similar to emergent vegetation (40-45%). In old organic soils (70-80% organic matter), C/OM increased to 57-60% due to accumulation of reduced organic materials.

AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands are perceived to provide nutrient dissipation services and serve as the final buffer between excess nutrient loads coming from nearby upland watersheds and sensitive estuarine waters. The construction and restoration of tidal marshes has the potential to benefit coastal waters. However, the water quality services of tidal wetlands have yet to be established with any certainty. This is in part due to the difficulty of monitoring these systems where flow and concentrations vary widely with tidal ebb and flood along with rainfall events mobilizing nutrients in pulses from upstream watersheds. In this article, we show over a period of 10 days following a rainfall event, the value of high temporal resolution data to characterize the complex nutrient and flow dynamics and to reliably calculate material balances in a created coastal marsh in North Carolina. Ultraviolet-visible spectrometers were used to obtain 15-min concentration data for nitrate, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, total suspended solids, phosphate, and total phosphorus. Our results show that a pulse of nitrate moved through the marsh from upstream agricultural production following the rainfall event and 25% (13 kg of 53 kg) of the nitrate was retained in the marsh over a period of 10 days. No other material showed a clear pulse from the upstream agricultural production. The marsh acted as a sink for total suspended solids (40 kg) and had near neutral mass balances for dissolved organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, and phosphate. Subsequent simulations indicated that different and erroneous results would have been obtained from 2, 6- or 12-h sampling intervals. These results demonstrate, even on a short term basis, why high-frequency data acquisition is necessary in these tidal marsh systems to truly quantify their impact on water quality ecosystem services.

TI  - Accelerated Sea-Level Rise Limits Vegetation Capacity to Sequester Soil Carbon in Coastal Wetlands: A Study Case in Southeastern Australia
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of global carbon stocks in coastal wetlands reveal that these are some of the most efficient carbon-sequestering environments in the world, which has prompted a renewed interest in conservation and restoration programs as an opportunity for greenhouse gas abatement. Accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands is linked to diverse factors such as the type of vegetation, geomorphic setting, and sediment supply. Feedbacks between these factors and the tidal flow conditions drive the dynamics of carbon accumulation rates. Climate change-induced sea-level rise has been shown to increase the vulnerability to submergence of saltmarsh and mangroves in coastal wetlands, even if accommodation and landward colonization are possible. These potential losses of wetland vegetation combined with the reduced productivity of newly colonized areas will directly affect the capacity of the wetlands to sequester carbon from sediments and root growth. Here, we implement an eco-geomorphic model to simulate vegetation dynamics, soil carbon accumulation, and changes in soil carbon stock for a restored mangrove-saltmarsh wetland experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. We evaluate model outcomes for existing conditions and two different management scenarios aimed at mitigating sea-level rise effects and conserve wetland vegetation. Even though some management measures can result in partial conservation of wetland vegetation, they do not necessarily result in the best option for soil carbon capture. Our results suggest that accelerated sea-level can trigger accelerated wetland colonization resulting in wetland areas with limited opportunities for soil carbon capture from sediment and root mineralization, an issue that has not been considered in previous studies.

TI  - Methane production potential and methanogenic archaea community dynamics along the Spartina alterniflora invasion chronosequence in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora, which has high net primary productivity and superior reproductive capacity compared with native plants, has led to rapid organic carbon accumulation and increased methane (CH4) emission in the coastal salt marsh of China. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.

TI  - Effects of freshwater inputs on soil quality in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the degradation or loss of coastal wetlands, more and more restoration projects have been widely conducted. Freshwater inputs have been proved to be an effective restoration way for degraded coastal wetlands. However, little information is available on the changes in soil quality caused by freshwater inputs. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in freshwater restoration wetlands (FRW), tidal salt marshes with Suaeda salsa (SSM) and tidal salt marshes with Tamarix chinensis (TSM) in the Yellow River Delta, China, in August 2015, to investigate the changes in soil quality after freshwater inputs. Our results showed that soil salinity was significantly higher in natural wetlands than that in freshwater restoration wetlands (p < 0.05), while no significant differences in soil organic matter (SOM) were observed among three wetlands (p > 0.05). Cluster analysis and principal component analysis exhibited that soil samples in natural wetlands and freshwater restoration wetlands were clearly distinguished. Soil properties were screened and transformed to establish a soil quality index (SQI) for the assessment of soil quality. Soil salinity, SOM and silt were selected in the minimum data set in this study. Although there were no statistical differences in SQIs (p > 0.05), both linear SQI (SQI(L)) and non-linear SQI (SQI(NL)) for three wetlands followed the order: SSM > FRW > TSM. And the SQI(L) values were lower compared with SQI(NL). The contributions of soil salinity to SQI(L) for three wetlands and SQI(NL) for TSM and SSM were the highest in the minimum data for three wetlands, while SOM showed the highest contribution proportion of SQI(NL) for FRW.

TI  - Lateral shoreline erosion and shore-proximal sediment deposition on a coastal marsh from seasonal, storm and decadal measurements
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistence of coastal marsh is dependent on its ability to maintain elevation relative to sea level, particularly for marshes experiencing high rates of shoreline erosion due to wave-attack, storms, and sea level rise. Sediments eroded at the marsh edge are either delivered onto the marsh platform or into the estuary, the latter resulting in a net loss of marsh sediments and soil carbon. Knowledge on the timing, pattern, and quantity of sediment deposition versus shoreline erosion along the marsh-estuary interface is critical for evaluating the overall health and vulnerability of coastal marshes to future scenarios of sea level rise and for estimating sediment budgets. Here we examined marsh shoreline erosion and sediment deposition for marsh sites experiencing a range of shoreline erosion rates and different levels of wind-wave exposure within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and Wildlife Refuge in Mississippi. We developed a method for calculating an erosion-deposition sediment budget using marsh elevation profiles, shoreline erosion rate, and sediment deposition measurements. Sediment budgets were calculated at four sites with varying shoreline erosion rates. Much of the sediment eroded at the marsh edge can be accounted for as marsh platform deposition, except at the most erosive site, suggesting a possible erosion threshold where eroded sediment mass is greater than platform deposition. Consistent with other studies of marsh creeks, sediment delivery to the marsh platform appears to be largely driven by wave climate. These data suggest that for erosive bay-estuarine shorelines, sediment delivered into the marsh is largely concentrated near the marsh shoreline, although shoreline erosion does not always result in a net loss of sediments from the marsh system in either decadal or annual assessments.

TI  - Exogenous Nitrogen Enrichment Impact on the Carbon Mineralization and DOC of the Freshwater Marsh Soil
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - By laboratory incubation experiment, under aerobic and submerged soil moisture conditions, we investigated the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with different nitrogen inputs in a freshwater marsh soil. The results showed that under aerobic condition, there were no significant effects on the mineralization of SOC and contents of DOC as the net nitrogen input was 1 mg.g(-1) (N1), however, they were significantly higher than control and N1 treatments when nitrogen input increased to 2 and 5 mg.g(-1) (N2, N3), and the amount of DOC was respectively 187.22% and 203.25% higher than control (250.62 mg.kg(-1)). Under submerged condition, all N treatments restrained the mineralization of SOC, and the content of DOC was respectively 88.34% (N1) 82.69% (N2) and 80.04% (M) lower than control (642.52 mg.kg(-1)). There were significant positive correlations between the contents of DOC and the amounts of cumulative C by mineralization (R-2 was 0.939 and 0.843, respectively), which suggested that the changes of DOC affected by N input might be one of the important reasons that arose the differences of SOC mineralization. The results also indicate that as the waterlogged environment disappeared in wedand, the Supply of exogenous nitrogen might bring large loss of SOC through enhancing the mineralization of SOC and leaching of DOC.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY OF ALLUVIAL DRAINED SOILS IN DEPENDENCE OF GENESIS AND TYPES OF LANDS
T2  - Agrochemical Herald
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological activity of alluvial marsh soils is determined by a complex of soil properties and regimes and is characterized by genetically determined low values. For example, peroxidase and polyphenoxidase, reflecting the transformation of organic matter, vary in the range from 1.5 to 7.3 mg of purporogallin/100 g of soil in 30 minutes. The intensity of soil respiration and catalytic activity, depending on the subtype of alluvial soils, lies in the range from 1.3 to 3.9 cm3 per g for min and from 0.7 to 4.4 mg CO2 per 10 g for 24 h, respectively. The highest activity of the enzyme urease was observed in the soil of the plowed plot (9.8 mg of NH4 per 10 g for 24 h), the least - in virgin dry soil (2.4 mg of NH4 per 10 g for 24 h). Cellulolytic activity of alluvial bog soils varied from 12.1% to18.9. The interrelation of indicators of the biological activity of alluvial soils with the content and component com- position of organic matter has been established.

TI  - Assessment of carbon allocation and biomass production in a natural stand of the salt marsh plant Spartina anglica using C-13
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The proportional allocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon to the root and shoot system of salt marsh plants is an important element in the carbon cycle of tidal salt marshes. The commonly applied field methods giving insight on this point are based on successive harvesting of biomass. These methods, however, lack accuracy and do not yield reliable data over short time intervals. In the present study, the stable carbon isotope C-13 was used as a tracer of carbon flow in Spartina anglica. Shoot clusters of this halophyte were incubated with (CO2)-C-13 (ca 1 h) in a salt marsh in the SW Netherlands. Four days after the incubations, shoots and roots/rhizomes were sampled to determine enrichment with the heavy isotope. Although S. anglica is a clonal plant, only a minor part of the excess C-13 incorporated in plant tissues due to the incubation procedure was found outside the incubation plots. The data revealed the dynamic nature of carbon allocation in S. anglica, leading to seasonal changes in the ratio of carbon allocated to above-ground versus below-ground tissues. The ratio was highest in August (6.19) and lowest in September (1.60), but more carbon was always invested in above-ground plant parts than in below-ground plant parts. These findings strongly suggest that, on an annual basis, above-ground biomass production outweighs below-ground biomass production in this S. anglica population. Root/rhizome production over short-term periods (10 to 12 d) was calculated by combining the data on the ratios of C-13 allocation with measurements of above-ground biomass increments over these periods. On an annual basis, above-ground and below-ground biomass production was estimated to be 1130 and 556 g dry wt m(-2), respectively. A survey of the Literature shows that the ratio of shoot to root/rhizome production of Spartina spp. vegetation is highly variable, ranging from a clear dominance of shoot production (as is suggested by our data) to the completely opposite situation with root/rhizome production amply exceeding shoot production. This may imply considerable differences in the functioning of Spartina-dominated marsh systems, e.g. with respect to the dominance of aerobic or anaerobic mineralization processes and to mineralization-linked cycling of sulphur and nitrogen.

TI  - Modeling Salt Marsh Vegetation Height Using Unoccupied Aircraft Systems and Structure from Motion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide important services to coastal ecosystems in the southeastern United States. In many locations, salt marsh habitats are threatened by coastal development and erosion, necessitating large-scale monitoring. Assessing vegetation height across the extent of a marsh can provide a comprehensive analysis of its health, as vegetation height is associated with Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and can be used to track degradation or growth over time. Traditional methods to do this, however, rely on manual measurements of stem heights that can cause harm to the marsh ecosystem. Moreover, manual measurements are limited in scale and are often time and labor intensive. Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) can provide an alternative to manual measurements and generate continuous results across a large spatial extent in a short period of time. In this study, a multirotor UAS equipped with optical Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors was used to survey five salt marshes in Beaufort, North Carolina. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry of the resultant imagery allowed for continuous modeling of the entire marsh ecosystem in a three-dimensional space. From these models, vegetation height was extracted and compared to ground-based manual measurements. Vegetation heights generated from UAS data consistently under-predicted true vegetation height proportionally and a transformation was developed to predict true vegetation height. Vegetation height may be used as a proxy for Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and contribute to blue carbon estimates, which describe the carbon sequestered in marine ecosystems. Employing this transformation, our results indicate that UAS and SfM are capable of producing accurate assessments of salt marsh health via consistent and accurate vegetation height measurements.

T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Halimione portulacoides, on the composition of the sedimentary humic acids was evaluated. For this purpose, cores of colonized and non-colonized sediments from a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) were collected, and the humic acids of different layers were extracted and characterized by Fourier transform infrared, synchronous molecular fluorescence (Deltalambda = 60 nm) and UV-visible spectroscopies and also by elemental analysis. The infrared spectra suggest the presence of more peptide residues and carbohydrates in the sedimentary humic acids from surface and around the plant roots at the site colonized by H. portulacoides, when compared with the humic acids from the depth-equivalent sediment layers at the non-colonized site. The higher content of protein-type materials is confirmed by the lowest values of C/N ratios and the highest relative intensities of a band at lambda(exc) = 280 nm in the fluorescence spectra. The lowest epsilon(280) values obtained in the UV-visible spectra, and the infrared spectra suggest a lower aromatic content of the humic acids from the colonized site.

AB  - The La Perroche marsh is a small Holocene marsh on the south-western coast of the Oleron island (Bay of Biscay, France) presently occupied by a freshwater swamp and separated from the ocean by a continuous sand dune ridge. The study of its infill shows first basal conglomeratic deposits with calcareous pebbles on a Cenomanian rough substrate. The Holocene infill since 6000 years BP begins with a very fast sedimentation of sands. Then, the sedimentation becomes finer, with lagoonal to freshwater influences recorded by ostracods. The distribution of these deposits inside the marsh is asymmetric, with a thick sandy-gravely layer in the eastern part and a succession of sands, clays and organic layers in the western part. Communication with the sea is episodic, and the sedimentation is controlled by an active channel, as shown by the presence of displaced coastal-marine faunas at some sites. Around 5000 years BP, a coastal marsh began to develop with high organic matter contents. These organic deposits presently outcrop on the beach, suggesting a more seaward location of the shoreline at that time. Generally, these sediments are azoic. When fauna is present, it indicates brackish to freshwater environments showing a progressive isolation of the system. A second phase of terrigenous sedimentation occurred after a transgressive event around 2800-2500 years BP, but the communication with the sea was then very reduced, as indicated by mainly freshwater faunas. This transgressive event appears to be synchronous with a positive sea-level tendency recorded, throughout north-western European coasts, between 3000 and 2000 years BP. The definitive closing of the marsh occurred around 2100 years BP, after a second phase of freshwater marsh. (C) 2001 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - One of the most important reasons stated in legislation for protecting salt marshes is their support of commercially and recreationally important nekton (fish and crustaceans). Yet, there is a surprising level of uncertainty among scientists regarding the role of salt marshes in supporting secondary production. The emphasis has been on "marine transient" species (in earlier literature often referred to as "estuarine dependent") because they have life histories that seem designed to place young-of-the-year or juveniles in marsh habitats and because these species are often of commercial or recreational value. Salt marshes are believed to provide: 1) trophic support resulting in high growth rates, 2) increased survivorship due to lowered mortality, and 3) a suitable physico-chemical environment for development of young fishes. In this paper, we consider the evidence for each of these, with an emphasis on the trophic and survivorship aspects. The seasonally warmer temperatures of estuaries and salt marsh creeks apparently provide a metabolic advantage that supports high growth rates. The influence of marsh-derived organic matter in estuarine food webs is apparent, and its importance to marine transient fishes is supported by dietary, behavioral, and isotopic evidence. The major pathways by which marsh organic matter is transferred to fish are largely indirect, through microbial and invertebrate intermediaries. Invertebrates are the primary link to fish consumers of marsh-associated production, transforming microphytes, organic detritus, and microbial detrital heterotrophs into available biomass. Although most detrital organic carbon entering salt marsh systems, mainly from emergent grasses, is apparently respired by heterotrophs, the support of consumers by marsh plant detritus and microalgae can be equally important. The use of salt marsh detritus in food webs usually occurs in close proximity to the salt marsh indicating that outwelling of salt marsh organic matter offshore is not the dominant way that salt marshes support offshore fisheries. Salt marsh support of offshore fisheries is more probably by direct export of juvenile fish biomass and a trophic relay involving ontogenetic and cyclic migrations of nekton species, rather than export of organic detritus. Understanding the controls on marine transient fish mortality is probably the most problematic and least studied aspect of their ecology. The few estimates of mortality rates of fishes in estuaries are as high as, or higher than, mortality rates of fishes in other marine and Freshwater ecosystems. However, because of faster growth rates, fish spend less rime in the small stages with the higher mortality rates. Within estuaries, mortality rates for some species, but not all, are lower in marsh creeks compared to more open areas. The value of marshes as refuge habitat is probably due to the interaction of temperature, turbidity, and vegetative structure in restricting the foraging of piscine predators.

TI  - Human eutrophication drives biogeographic salt marsh productivity patterns in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are important natural carbon sinks with a large capacity to absorb exogenous nutrient inputs. The effects of nutrients on biogeographic productivity patterns, however, have been poorly explored in salt marshes. We conducted field surveys to examine how complex environments affect productivity of two common salt marsh plants, invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis, along an 18,000-km latitudinal gradient on the Chinese coastline. We harvested peak aboveground biomass as a proxy for productivity, and measured leaf functional traits (e.g., leaf area, specific leaf area [SLA], leaf nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]), soil nutrients (dissolved inorganic N [DIN] and available P [AP]), and salinity. We compiled data on mean annual temperature (MAT) and exogenous nutrients (both N and P). Then, we examined how these abiotic factors affect salt marsh productivity using both linear mixed effect models and structural equation modeling. Using a trait-based approach, we also examined how salt marsh productivity responds to changing environments across latitude. Exogenous nutrients (both N and P), compared with temperature and other variables (e.g., DIN, AP, salinity), were the dominant factors in explaining the biogeographic productivity patterns of both S. alterniflora and P. australis. Leaf size-related traits (e.g., leaf area), rather than leaf economic traits (e.g., SLA, leaf N and P), can be used to indicate the positive effects of exogenous nutrients on the productivity of these two species. Our results demonstrated that human eutrophication surpassed temperature as the major driver of biogeographic salt marsh productivity pattern, challenging current models in which biogeographic productivity pattern is primarily controlled by temperature. Our findings have potential broad implications for the management of S. alterniflora, which is a global invader, as it has benefited from coastal eutrophication. Furthermore, exogenous nutrient availability and leaf size need to be integrated into earth system models that are used to predict global plant productivity in salt marshes.

TI  - Spatial response of coastal marshes to increased atmospheric CO2
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production by plants. These accretion processes respond to changes in local and global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear. In particular, marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate change, has not yet been isolated and quantified. Using the available observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen levels. We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60% in the range of forcings explored. Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics. Our results imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent, are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than previously thought.

TI  - Ichthyofauna macrotidal salt marsh relationships: The example of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay.
T2  - CYBIUM
M3  - Article
AB  - At least 100 fish species are known to be present in the intertidal areas (estuaries, mud flats and salt marshes) of Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France). Between March 1996 and April 1999, 120 tides were sampled in an intertidal salt marsh creek. A total of 31 species were caught. This community was largely dominated by mullets (Liza ramada represents 87% of the total biomass) and sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus and P. lozanoi represent 82% of the total numbers). These species, along with Gasterosteus aculeatus, Syngnathus rostellatus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Mugil spp., Liza aurata and Sprattus sprattus, were the most frequent species. In Europe, salt marshes and their creeks are flooded only during high spring tides. So, fishes only invade this environment during short immersion periods, and no species can be considered as marsh resident.The salt marsh was colonised by fish every time the tide reached the creek, and during the short time of flood. dominant fish feed actively and exploit the high productivity. The mullet diet was composed of a mixture of sediment, salt marsh detritus. micro-benthic invertebrates and benthic diatoms. Gobies and sea bass (D. labrax) mainly feed on macroinvertebrates, and especially on Orchestia gammarellus, a salt marsh resident crustacean. These fish communities appear to be transporters of organic matter from salt marshes to coastal marine waters. They could play a significant role in the global energy budgets of coastal environments such as Mont Saint-Michel Bay. Moreover, we have shown that salt marshes seem to enable an important part of growth of young of the year sea bass (between 40 to 60% of their growth). These results confirm that this kind of wetland plays important trophic and nursery roles for these species. Differences in densities and population structure of these species into Mont Saint-Michel systems (tidal mud flats, estuaries and tidal salt marshes) can reduce the trophic competition.However, in Mont Saint-Michel Bay, ewes intensively graze three-quarters of salt marsh areas. This grazing has caused important impacts on the habitat structure, especially for O. gammarellus. In these areas, this crustacean is replaced by other food items that are less consumed by fish. Consequently, the trophic and nursery roles of European salt marshes for fishes are reduced. This example illustrates that management of wetlands to promote one component of their biota or use involves reductions in other species and functions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Population densities of anaerobic Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) and aerobic heterotrophs were inversely correlated in the surficial (0-2 cm) layers of Sapelo Island, Georgia, salt marsh sediments. In surficial sediments where densities of aerobic heterotrophs were low, the density of culturable FeRB correlated positively with the concentration of amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxides extractable by ascorbate. High FeRB densities and a decrease with depth of ascorbate-extractable Fe(III) were observed in the upper 6 cm of a tidal creek core. Culturable sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and SRB-targeted rRNA signals were also detected in the upper 6-cm depth. The disappearance of FeRB below 6 cm, however, coincided with a large increase in the abundance of SRB. Thus, when FeRB are not limited by the availability of readily reducible amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, FeRB may outcompete SRB for growth substrates. Shewanella putrefaciens- and Geobacteraceae-targeted rRNA signals were at or below detection limits in all sediment samples, indicating that these FeRB are not predominant members of the active FeRB populations. The ubiquitous presence of FeRB at the sites studied challenges the traditional view that dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction is not an important pathway of organic carbon oxidation in salt marsh sediments.

TI  - Stocks and losses of soil organic carbon from Chinese vegetated coastal habitats
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) represent a large sink for organic carbon (OC) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 +/- 0.6, 7.5 +/- 0.6, and 1.6 +/- 0.6 Tg C (+/- 95% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 +/- 17, 159 +/- 57, and 6 +/- 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

TI  - Effects of eutrophic water flooding on nitrate concentrations in mine wastes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes near urban, industrial and mining areas are often affected both by heavy metals and by eutrophic water. The aim of this study was to assess and evaluate the main processes involved in the decrease of nitrate concentration in pore water of mine wastes flooded with eutrophic water, considering the presence or absence of plant rhizhosphere. Basic (pH similar to 7.8) carbonated loam mine wastes and free-carbonated acidic (pH similar to 6.2) sandy-loam mine wastes were collected from polluted coastal salt marshes of SE Spain which regularly receive nutrient-enriched water. The wastes were put in pots and flooded for 15 weeks with eutrophic water (dissolved organic carbon similar to 26 mg L-1, PO43- similar to 23 mg L-1, NO3- similar to 180 mg L-1). Three treatments were assayed for each type of waste: pots with Sarcocornia fruticosa, pots with Phragmites australis and unvegetated pots. Soluble organic carbon, nitrate, soluble Cd. Pb and Zn, pH and Eh were monitored. But the 2nd day of flooding, nitrate concentrations had decreased between 70% and 90% (equivalent to 1.01-1.12 g N-NO3- m(-2) day(-1)) with respect to the content in the water used for flooding, except in unvegetated pots with acidic wastes. Denitrification was the main mechanism associated with the removal of nitrate. The role of vegetation in improving the rhizospheric environment was relevant in the acidic wastes because higher sand content, lower pH and higher soluble metal concentrations might strongly hinder microbial activity Hence, revegetation of salt marshes polluted by acidic sandy mining wastes might improve the capacity of this type of environment to act as a green filter against excessive nitrate contents flowing through them.

TI  - Litter decomposition of emergent macrophytes in a floodplain marsh of the Lower Parana River
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of litter decomposition on organic matter accumulation and nutrient cycling was studied in a floodplain marsh of the Lower Parana River by means of in situ litterbag experiments. The effect of waterborne nutrients on decomposition rates was studied through a laboratory litterbag experiment. Litter decomposition was rather slow remaining 40-50% of the initial mass after 2 years incubation. Similar decomposition rates were observed in laboratory and field experiments. Water fertilization did not significantly affect decomposition rates. Since organic matter production is faster than decomposition a net accumulation takes place in the upper layers of the marsh soil. N and P litter concentration increased during the decomposition experiment. Floodplain marshes represent effective sinks of nutrients through litter accumulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study we investigate the ecology and distribution of living benthic foraminifera to test the effect of hyper tidal exposure and their suitability as sea level indicators. Within a salt marsh area along the Canche Estuary (northern France), four transects were sampled to see the effects of maximal tidal constraints (shore transects) and minimal tidal constraints (alongshore transects). Multivariate analyses have been performed to determine the correlations between biotic (foraminiferal absolute abundances) and abiotic factors (elevation, grain-size, TOC and total sulphur). For each of the principal benthic foraminiferal species the tolerance to subaerial exposure have been estimated as well. Two distinctive foraminiferal zones have been identified along the vertical tidal gradient: a zone I in the higher part of the salt marsh dominated by agglutinated and porcelaneous taxa, and a zone II in the lower one dominated by hyaline specimens. Hyper tidal exposure constraints the foraminiferal vertical zonation in accordance with the tidal frame. However it does not constitute a threshold parameter able by itself to explain all the faunal variations in the Canche Estuary. For sea level indicators, foraminifera should be considered relative to tidal subaerial exposure rather than to absolute altitude. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Conterminous USA-Scale Map of Relative Tidal Marsh Elevation
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tidal wetlands provide myriad ecosystem services across local to global scales. With their uncertain vulnerability or resilience to rising sea levels, there is a need for mapping flooding drivers and vulnerability proxies for these ecosystems at a national scale. However, tidal wetlands in the conterminous USA are diverse with differing elevation gradients, and tidal amplitudes, making broad geographic comparisons difficult. To address this, a national-scale map of relative tidal elevation (Z*(MHW)), a physical metric that normalizes elevation to tidal amplitude at mean high water (MHW), was constructed for the first time at 30 x 30-m resolution spanning the conterminous USA. Contrary to two study hypotheses, watershed-level median Z*(MHW) and its variability generally increased from north to south as a function of tidal amplitude and relative sea-level rise. These trends were also observed in a reanalysis of ground elevation data from the Pacific Coast by Janousek et al. (Estuaries and Coasts 42 (1): 85-98, 2019). Supporting a third hypothesis, propagated uncertainty in Z*(MHW) increased from north to south as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) errors had an outsized effect under narrowing tidal amplitudes. The drivers of Z*(MHW) and its variability are difficult to determine because several potential causal variables are correlated with latitude, but future studies could investigate highest astronomical tide and diurnal high tide inequality as drivers of median Z*(MHW) and Z*(MHW) variability, respectively. Watersheds of the Gulf Coast often had propagated Z*(MHW) uncertainty greater than the tidal amplitude itself emphasizing the diminished practicality of applying Z*(MHW) as a flooding proxy to microtidal wetlands. Future studies could focus on validating and improving these physical map products and using them for synoptic modeling of tidal wetland carbon dynamics and sea-level rise vulnerability analyses.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes store large amounts of carbon but the magnitude and patterns of greenhouse gas (GHG; i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) fluxes are unclear. Information about GHG fluxes from these ecosystems comes from studies of sediments or at the ecosystem-scale (eddy covariance) but fluxes from tidal creeks are unknown. This dataset includes GHG concentrations in water, water quality, meteorology, sediment CO2 efflux, ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes, and plant phenology; all at half-hour time-steps over one year.This study was carried out in the St. Jones Reserve, a component of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve in Dover, Delaware, U.S.A. The study site is part of the following networks:- AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-StJ) - Phenocam (https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/sites/stjones/) The GHG concentration and efflux sampling point was located at Aspen Landing within a microtidal (mean tide range of 1.5 m), mesohaline (typical salinity of 5-18 ppt) salt marsh (Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, 2006) tidal creek.Main reference:    Trifunovic, B., Vazquez‐Lule, A., Capooci, M., Seyfferth, A.

AB  - Coastal vegetation plays an important role for climate change mitigation. Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes.

TI  - Dynamics of above- and belowground organic matter in a high latitude macrotidal saltmarsh
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variations in above- and belowground biomass were examined over the 1994 growing season (May to October) in the 3 major plant zones of a saltmarsh located on the Bay of Fundy. Standing crop of aboveground biomass was measured over the growing season. Belowground samples were processed at depth intervals of 2 cm, providing high-resolution vertical profiles to a depth of 40 cm. Spartina alterniflora showed evidence of the translocation of belowground biomass to aboveground tissue in the early part of the growing season, when the rate of aboveground growth is at a maximum. Shifts in S. alterniflora organic matter storage were most dynamic in the surface 16 cm. Biomass translocation generally was not significant in the S. patens stands, where the rate of aboveground growth was consistent throughout the growing season. All seasonal changes associated with Plantago maritima biomass seem to occur before July, since no changes in above- and belowground biomass were observed between July and October. P. maritima contributes the least to marsh soil organic matter.

TI  - Rhizosphere processes induce changes in dissimilatory iron reduction in a tidal marsh soil: a rhizobox study
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Although the role of microbial iron respiration in tidal marshes has been recognized for decades, the effect of rhizosphere processes on dissimilatory ferric iron reduction (FeR) is poorly known. Herein, we examined the FeR surrounding the root zone of three tidal marsh plants.Methods Using in situ rhizoboxes, we accurately separated rhizobox soil as one rhizosphere zone, and three bulk soil zones. Dissimilatory and sulfidic-mediated FeR were quantified by accumulation of non-sulfidic Fe(II) and Fe sulfides over time, respectively.Results The rates of dissimilatory FeR attained 42.5 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) in the rhizosphere, and logarithmically declined by up to 19.1 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) in the outer bulk soil. The rates of sulfidic-mediated FeR were less than 2 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) among all zones. Poorly crystalline Fe(III), DOC and DON, porewater Fe2+, and SO42- were all enriched in the rhizosphere, whereas non-sulfidic Fe(II) and Fe sulfides gradually accumulated away from the roots. Iron reducers (Geobacter, Bacillus, Shewanella, and Clostridium) had higher populations in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Higher rates of dissimilatory FeR were observed in the Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora rhizoboxes than in the Cyperus malaccensis rhizoboxes.Conclusions The radial change pattern of dissimilatory FeR rates were determined by allocation of poorly crystalline Fe(III) and dissolved organic carbon. The interspecies difference of rhizosphere dissimilatory FeR was associated with the root porosity and aerenchyma of the tidal marsh plants.

T2  - CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - The contribution of organic and inorganic constituents to recent vertical accretion rates (since 1963/4) was estimated for 141 salt marshes ranging from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. The range of vertical accretion and inorganic accumulation rates were 0.09 to 1.78 cm y(-1), and 0.01 to 0.53 g cm y(-1), respectively. The volume of the accumulated organic and inorganic in all salt marshes averaged 3.8 and 4.9%, respectively, of the total, which is relatively low among soil types. The remaining soil volume is water and air. There was a direct relationship between vertical accretion and organic accumulation that explained 59% of the variation for all samples combined. In contrast, the bulk density is strongly and directly related to inorganic content, but not the vertical accretion rate. A multiple regression equation describing the vertical accumulation as a function of mineral and organic accumulation suggests that organic accumulation is five times more important than inorganic accumulation for East coast salt marshes (n = 19; weight basis), but that inorganic content is a statistically-insignificant factor for Gulf of Mexico salt marshes (n = 122), or for all salt marshes examined (n = 141). A simple linear regression showed that a 1 cm rise in salt marsh elevation was composed of 10.9 g of organic matter. A threshold level of 0.02 g organic matter y(-1) accumulation can continue without inorganic accumulation. It appears that it is the accumulation of organic matter that controls inorganic accumulation in established marshes, not the reverse. These results document the dominant role of below ground plant material in maintaining salt marshes once they are established. When wetland hydrology is altered, it is the organic soil constituents that are affected (through oxidation or plant growth below ground), thus explaining salt marsh conversion to open water through indirect changes in hydrology. Salt marsh management and restoration efforts would do well to keep in mind the plant's health, especially belowground, if the long-term and effective strategies are to be successfully implemented. The biological components, not the geological components, appear to control the fate of established salt marshes.

TI  - Selective geochemistry of iron in mangrove soils in a semiarid tropical climate: effects of the burrowing activity of the crabs Ucides cordatus and Uca maracoani
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioturbation by crabs may affect processes associated with organic matter decomposition in mangrove soils. This study examines how two crabs (Uca maracoani and Ucides cordatus), which are of substantial ecological and economic importance in semiarid coastal areas of Brazil, affect biogeochemical processes in mangrove soils. For this purpose, the physicochemical and geochemical parameters of the soils at different sites were analyzed. The redox potential was always positive at bioturbated sites (+12 to +218 mV), indicating more oxidizing conditions conducive to the oxidation of pyrite and precipitation of oxyhydroxides. In contrast, anoxic conditions prevailed at the control site (Eh < 0 mV), and the most abundant form of iron was Fe-pyrite. The highest degree of iron pyritization (DOP) was observed in soils from the control site (similar to 48%) and the lowest in the bioturbated soils (5-16%), indicating that crabs have an oxidative effect on iron sulfides. The results also suggest that U. cordatus has a higher oxidizing capacity than U. maracoani, probably because it constructs larger and deeper burrows. The results demonstrate that both crabs must be considered as important bioturbators in Brazilian semiarid mangrove soils, being capable of enhancing organic matter decomposition and also shifting the dominant pathway of organic matter degradation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability in carbon dioxide and methane exchange at three coastal marshes along a salinity gradient in a northern Gulf of Mexico estuary
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon gas fluxes in tidal marshes vary spatially and temporally because of vegetation cover, subsurface biogeochemical processes, and environmental forcing. The objective of this study was to examine how ecosystem carbon gas exchange changes along an estuarine salinity gradient. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) gas fluxes from three marshes representing a salinity gradient (0-32 ppt) in the Mobile Bay estuary, Alabama, USA. CH4 flux was relatively small with no significant differences across sites despite salinity differences. Interestingly, sediment porewater CH4 concentrations were significantly higher at the high salinity salt marsh and decreased with decreasing salinity. Midday net ecosystem exchange (where a positive rate indicates net carbon assimilated through photosynthesis) was greatest at the most fresh site (4.8 +/- A 0.3 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), followed by the saline (2.8 +/- A 1.0 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and brackish (1.4 +/- A 0.6 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) sites. However, net ecosystem exchange integrated diurnally revealed each marsh to be a net CO2 source to the atmosphere as a result of high ecosystem respiration with the freshwater marsh emitting more CO2 (-893.4 +/- A 187.9 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than the brackish (-517.8 +/- A 85.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and salt marsh (-410.2 +/- A 98.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)). This finding leads to the conclusion that either the marshes are losing carbon or that they receive a subsidy of respirable carbon, possibly via tidal deposition. The extent to which sedimentation from tidal deposition contributes carbon to these ecosystems, however, remains unknown. Without such a subsidy, marshes in the study area will not be able to keep up with sea level rise.

TI  - Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry of Soil Organic Matter Extracted from a Brazilian Mangrove and Spanish Salt Marshes
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil organic matter (SOM) extracted under different vegetation types from a Brazilian mangrove (Pai Matos Island, Sao Paulo State) and from three Spanish salt marshes (Betanzos Ria and Corrubedo Natural Parks, Galicia, and the Albufera Natural Park, Valencia) was investigated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is a useful tool to study the behavior and composition of SOM in wetland environments such as mangroves and salt marshes. Additional profiles need to be studied for each vegetation type, however, to improve the interpretability of the chemical data.

TI  - Soil-Plant Relationships in Mediterranean Salt Marshes across Dune-Cultivated Land Gradient
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationships between soil factors and plant species were investigated in salt marshes on the west coast of central Italy along a dune-cultivated land gradient with similar topographic elevations. Plant community composition was quantified in three zones (marsh-dune border, central marsh, and marsh-cultivated land border) identified across the gradient. The results suggest that the distribution and variation in abundance "performance" of plant species is mainly ruled by salinity and soil texture gradients (from sandy to silt-clay). Texture seemed to affect vegetation zonation in the marshes near sand dunes, since at the marsh-dune border the percentage of wind-blown sand increases. Variations in field capacity, total organic carbon, pH, and calcium carbonate did not appear to control the performance of plant species. Indications on the performance of six species are provided. Limbarda crithmoides increased with the amount of sand and was often located at the marsh-dune border. Elymus repens and Phragmites australis increased with decreasing salinity and were frequently found at marsh borders, however E. repens also increased with the amount of silt-clay. Sarcocornia fruticosa increased with salinity and silt-clay, while Halimione portulacoides increased with salinity and seemed less subject to changes in soil texture. Elymus pycnanthus increased with salinity and decreased with the amount of silt-clay, however, the ordination suggested that other factors may be determinant for this species. These species could be useful to map saline environments and to reconstruct an appropriate scenario in restoration projects of Mediterranean salt marshes.

TI  - Microbial processes linked to soil organic matter in a restored and natural coastal wetland in Barataria Bay, Louisiana
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - contains 40% of the lower 48 United States coastal and estuarine wetlands and also has the highest rates of wetland loss, similar to 80% of the nation's total. Approximately, 4900 km(2) of coastal land in Louisiana has been lost since 1930. Our study location, Barataria Bay, has one of the highest coastal wetland erosion rates in the nation, at similar to 41 km(2)y(-1) and therefore is a high priority for wetland restoration activities. Sandy sediment dredged from the bed of the Mississippi River was placed at targeted locations in Barataria Bayin an effort to restore and protect coastal Louisiana marshes. This study sought to determine how comparable these dredged river-sediment marsh soils are to those of the surrounding natural marshes in Barataria Bay. Percent organic matter in the created marsh was 11.6% of the natural marsh. Extractable ammonium and extractable nitrate in the created marsh soils were 15.4% and 8.75% of the natural marsh. In the created marsh, the beta-glucosidase enzyme activity was 10.3% and soil oxygen demand was 11.2% of the natural marsh, reflecting significantly lower soil microbial processes within the created marshsites. Associated ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and nutrient availability for support of primary production, are consequently significantly lower in the newly created wetland soil. These data provide a baseline for monitoring and eventual determination of the trajectory for development of microbial-driven ecosystem services of created wetlands using dredged river sediment.

TI  - Plant invasion impacts on the gross and net primary production of the salt marsh on eastern coast of China: Insights from leaf to ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic Spartina alterniflora from North America has been rapidly invading the entire Chinese coast, while the impacts of plant invasion on the gross (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) of the coastal salt marshes were less known. In this study, we investigated the photosynthetic performance, leaf characteristics, and primary production of the exotic C-4 grass and the dominant native C-3 grass (Phragmites australis) in two marsh mixtures (equipped with eddy covariance systems) in the Yangtze Estuary. The light-saturated photosynthetic rate and annual peak leaf area index (LAI) of S. alterniflora was higher than that of P. australis throughout the growing season. The leaf nitrogen content of P. australis declined sharper during the latter growing season than that of S. alterniflora. The leaf-to-canopy production model with species-specific (C-3 and C-4 types) parameterizations could reasonably simulate the daily trends and annual GPP amount against the 3year flux measurements from 2005 to 2007, and the modeled NPP agreed with biomass measurements from the two species during 2012. The percentage contributions of GPP between S. alterniflora and P. australis were on average 5.82:1 and 2.91:1 in the two mixtures, respectively. The annual NPP amounts from S. alterniflora were higher by approximately 1.6 times than that from P. australis. Our results suggested that higher photosynthesis efficiency, higher LAI, and longer growing season resulted in greater GPP and NPP in the exotic species relative to the native species. The rapid expansion rate of S. alterniflora further made it the leading contributor of primary production in the salt marsh.

TI  - Denitrification and organic carbon availability in riparian wetland soils and subsurface sediments
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of organic C quantity and quality on denitrification in riparian environments is poorly understood. We measured denitrification potential (DNP), organic matter, and several fractions of organic C in surface soils and subsurface sediments in a river riparian zone. Surface soils in conifer forest peat, mixed forest, and marsh sites had similar DNP, although mean organic matter ranged from 9.4% (marsh) to 19.6% (mixed forest) and 36.6% (peat). These soils also differed widely in organic C, water-extractable C, and anaerobic mineralizable C. Mean DNP in peat at depths of 0.8 to 1.4 m was four times lower than in the surface peat. Mean organic matter and organic C were significantly greater in the deep peat than at the surface, whereas the other C fractions were similar. Mean organic matter content of buried channel sediments at depths of 2 to 3 m was 3.6%; however, mean DNP was 75 to 80 times lower than in the surface mixed forest and marsh soils. When the three surface soil sites were considered separately, anaerobic mineralizable C showed the highest correlation with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.87) and the conifer peat soil (r = 0.82). Water-extractable C was also highly correlated with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.81). Correlations between DNP and either organic matter or the three C fractions were not significant in the deep peat, whereas the former channel sediments showed a significant relationship between DNP and both organic matter (r = 0.81) and water-extractable C (r = 0.81). These results show that C quantity and quality influence DNP, but no single index was a good predictor for all soil types.

TI  - The status and future of tidal marshes in New Jersey faced with sea level rise
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE COASTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Salt marshes are key coastal ecosystems that provide habitats for wildlife, including invertebrates, fishes, and birds. They provide ecosystem services such as protection from storm surges and waves, attenuation of flooding, sequestration of pollutants (e.g., blue carbon), and nutrient removal. They are currently under great threat from sea level rise (SLR). We collected information about trends in the horizontal extent (acreage) of New Jersey salt marshes and recent elevation changes compared with the current local rate of SLR in New Jersey, which is between 5 and 6 mm year(-1). We found pervasive, although variable, rates of marsh loss that resulted from both anthropogenic disturbance as well as edge erosion and interior ponding expected from SLR. Elevation trends suggest that the current rates of SLR exceed most marsh elevation gains, although some Phragmites-dominated marshes keep pace with SLR. Four potential remedies to address current coastal trends of marsh loss were described in the context of New Jersey's regulatory and management environment: protection of marsh inland migration pathways, altered management of Phragmites, thin layer sediment placement, and living shoreline installations. Proactive steps are necessary if coastal wetland ecosystems are to be maintained over the next few decades.

TI  - The renaissance of Odum's outwelling hypothesis in 'Blue Carbon' science
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The term 'Blue Carbon' was coined about a decade ago to highlight the important carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated ecosystems. The term has paved the way for the development of programs and policies that preserve and restore these threatened coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation. Blue carbon research has focused on quantifying carbon stocks and burial rates in sediments or accumulating as biomass. This focus on habitat-bound carbon led us to losing sight of the mobile blue carbon fraction. Oceans, the largest active reservoir of carbon, have become somewhat of a blind spot. Multiple recent investigations have revealed high outwelling (i.e., lateral fluxes or horizontal exports) of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon, as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) from blue carbon habitats. In this paper, we conceptualize outwelling in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass and macroalgae ecosystems, diagnose key challenges preventing robust quantification, and pave the way for future work integrating mobile carbon in the blue carbon framework. Outwelling in mangroves and saltmarshes is usually dominated by DIC (mostly as bicarbonate), while POC seems to be the major carbon species exported from seagrass meadows and macroalgae forests. Carbon outwelling science is still in its infancy, and estimates remain limited spatially and temporally. Nevertheless, the existing datasets imply that carbon outwelling followed by ocean storage is relevant and may exceed local sediment burial as a long-term (>centuries) blue carbon sequestration mechanism. If this proves correct as more data emerge, ignoring carbon outwelling may underestimate the perceived sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems.

T2  - Journal of Agriculture and Water Resources Research Soil and Water Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of transect were undertaken to understand and properly classify some marsh soils in southern Iraq. These soils were highly calcareous and salinity was a major problem. The ECe values are fluctated which depend upon the ground season. The main clay minerals identified were montmorillonite, mica, chlorite, kaolinite, and palygroskite. Butmontmorillonitevas dominant. The studied pedons have been classified according to U.S. soil Taxonomy. In spite of high organic carbon in A horizons, none of these soils had a mollic epipedons. These soils were classified as Fluvaquent great group and two sub-groups Vertic and Typic were distingished.

TI  - Recent advances in understanding Colombian mangroves
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Its Spatial Distribution in Coastal Wetlands Utilizing Planet Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are biologically productive ecosystems that generate and sequester significant quantities of organic matter. Plant biomass varies spatially within a salt marsh and it is tedious and often logistically impractical to quantify biomass from field measurements across an entire landscape. Satellite data are useful for estimating aboveground biomass, however, high-resolution data are needed to resolve the spatial details within a salt marsh. This study used 3-m resolution multispectral data provided by Planet to estimate aboveground biomass within two salt marshes, North Inlet-Winyah Bay (North Inlet) National Estuary Research Reserve, and Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) Long-Term Ecological Research site. The Akaike information criterion analysis was performed to test the fidelity of several alternative models. A combination of the modified soil vegetation index 2 (MSAVI(2)) and the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) gave the best fit to the square root-normalized biomass data collected in the field at North Inlet (Willmott's index of agreement d = 0.74, RMSE = 223.38 g/m(2), AIC(w) = 0.3848). An acceptable model was not found among all models tested for PIE data, possibly because the sample size at PIE was too small, samples were collected over a limited vertical range, in a different season, and from areas with variable canopy architecture. For North Inlet, a model-derived landscape scale biomass map showed differences in biomass density among sites, years, and showed a robust relationship between elevation and biomass. The growth curve established in this study is particularly useful as an input for biogeomorphic models of marsh development. This study showed that, used in an appropriate model with calibration, Planet data are suitable for computing and mapping aboveground biomass at high resolution on a landscape scale, which is needed to better understand spatial and temporal trends in salt marsh primary production.

TI  - Role of rhizosphere and soil properties for the phytomanagement of a salt marsh polluted by mining wastes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the soil properties and their modifications within the rhizosphere of spontaneous vegetation as key factors to assess the phytomanagement of a salt marsh polluted by mining wastes. A field survey was performed based on a plot sampling design. The results provided by the analyses of rhizospheric soil (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, total nitrogen, etc.) and metal(loid)s' phytoavailability (assessed by EDTA) were discussed and related to plant metal uptake. The averages of pH and EC values of the bulk soil and rhizospheric samples were in the range of neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7-8) to saline (> 2 dS m(-1)), respectively. Heavy metal and As concentrations (e.g. similar to 600 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, similar to 11,000 mg kg(-1) Pb) were higher in the rhizosphere for both total and EDTA-extractable fraction. Phragmites australis uptaked the highest concentrations in roots (e.g. similar to 66 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 1,770 mg kg(-1) Zn) but not in shoots, for which most of plant species showed low values for Zn (< 300 mg kg(-1)) but not for Cd (> 0.5 mg kg(-1)) or Pb (similar to 20-40 mg kg(-1)). Vegetation distribution in the studied salt marsh looked to be more affected by salinity than by metal pollution. The free availability of water for plants and the incoming nutrient-enriched effluents which flow through the salt marsh may have hindered the metal(loid)s' phytotoxicity. The phytomanagement of these polluted areas employing the spontaneous vegetation is a good option in order to improve the ecological indicators and to prevent the transport of pollutants to nearby areas.

TI  - Functional equivalency of restored and natural salt marshes
T2  - CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - Although achieving functional equivalency of restored and natural ecosystems is a desirable restoration goal, direct assessments of function are rare, as are data supporting the use of indicators of function. The issue is how structural attributes can be used to assess ecosystem functioning. A functional equivalency index mixed both structural and functional measures, and an often-cited model of ecosystem degradation and restoration depicted a straight-line relationship between the two variables. Several points need clarification, not only for tidal wetlands but for restoration ecology generally. It is unrealistic to expect linear relationships among structure, function, and time; it is also inappropriate to assume, for natural and restored ecosystems, that equivalent structure means equivalent function. For example, using plant biomass to compare primary productivity rates assumes equal biomass:productivity relationships among sites; restored and natural wetlands are less likely to be similar in grazing, decomposition, and export rates than are two natural sites. Likewise, using soil organic matter (OM) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) to indicate nutrient availability may be less appropriate for restored and natural marsh comparisons than for two natural sites. We recommend that comparisons of structural attributes be labeled structural equivalency measures, thereby avoiding misconceptions. Useful structural measures for assessing tidal wetland restoration are: soil texture; soil OM, soil nutrients, vegetation structure (height distributions); invertebrate and fish populations (especially fish size distributions), and topographic complexity.

TI  - Anthropocene Survival of Southern New England's Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern New England, salt marshes are exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of accelerated sea level rise. Regional rates of sea level rise have been as much as 50 % greater than the global average over past decades, a more than fourfold increase over late Holocene background values. In addition, coastal development blocks many potential marsh migration routes, and compensatory mechanisms relying on positive feedbacks between inundation and sediment deposition are insufficient to counter inundation increases in extreme low-turbidity tidal waters. Accordingly, multiple lines of evidence suggest that marsh submergence is occurring in southern New England. A combination of monitoring data, field re-surveys, radiometric dating, and analysis of peat composition have established that, beginning in the early and mid-twentieth century, the dominant low-marsh plant, Spartina alterniflora, has encroached upward in tidal marshes, and typical high-marsh plants, including Juncus gerardii and Spartina patens, have declined, providing strong evidence that vegetation changes are being driven, at least in part, by higher water levels. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery show shoreline retreat, widening and headward extension of channels, and new and expanded interior depressions. Papers in this special section highlight changes in marsh-building processes, patterns of vegetation loss, and shifts in species composition. The final papers turn to strategies for minimizing and coping with marsh loss by managing adaptively and planning for landward marsh migration. It is hoped that this collection offers lessons that will be of use to researchers and managers on coasts where relative sea level is not yet rising as fast as in southern New England.

TI  - Composition of the Water-Soluble Soil Fraction on the Barents Sea Coast: Organic Carbon and Nitrogen, Low-Molecular Weight Components
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water extracts from soils of the Barents Sea coast (the Khaipudyr Bay) were analyzed for the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen by the method of high-temperature catalytic oxidation with non-dispersive IR registration; the contents of low-molecular-weight acids, carbohydrates, and alcohols were determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry. The mass fraction of inorganic carbon (HCO3-) was measured potentiometrically, and the content of inorganic nitrogen (N-NO3-, N-NH4+) was determined by photometry. In marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols (Arenic or Loamic, Epiprotosalic)), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 0.1-0.8, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.01-0.05 g/kg, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.06 omega(C-org)(H2O) + 0.01, and (C/N)(H2O) = 7-21. The content of individual components does not exceed 20 mg/kg, including carbohydrates (50-90%), acids (10-50%), and alcohols (<3%). In peat horizons of tundra soils (Cryic Histosols and Histic Cryosols), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 4-10, omega(N-org)(H2O) similar to and (C/N)(H2O) = 25-56. Litter and peat horizons accumulate both individual humus components and total dissolved organic carbon. The total weight of the identified substances is 200300 mg/kg, 80-90% of them are carbohydrates, 10-20% are acids, and 0-9% are alcohols. The accumulation of (C-org)(H2O) and (N-NH4+)(H2O) takes place above the permafrost table. It is argued that the ratios of organic forms of carbon and nitrogen in soil water extracts and the content of low-molecular weight organic compounds in soils can be used as indicators of pedogenic processes in the Far North.

TI  - Physiological relationship between oil tolerance and flooding tolerance in marsh plants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are highly susceptible to accidental oil spills. Oil can cover root tissues, inhibiting gas exchange and increasing root oxygen stress. This is similar to flooding; both conditions reduce the availability of oxygen to a plant. Therefore, it was hypothesized that tolerance to both flooding and oil are related in plants, as both impede gas exchange between roots and their environment. We investigated effects of oil on respiration and photosynthesis in nine marsh species ranging from flooding sensitive (hypothesized oil sensitive) to flooding tolerant (hypothesized oil tolerant). Plants were subjected to 6 L m(-2) light motor oil in greenhouse experiments for six weeks. Oil exposure caused root oxygen deficiency in all but the most flooding tolerant species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activities increased in roots of flooding sensitive species and moderately flooding tolerant plants under oil exposure, indicating oxygen stress. In contrast, flooding tolerant plants showed no sign of oxygen deficiency under oil treatment. Additionally, decreases in photosynthetic rates were measured in some species following oil exposure. Photosynthesis was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, suggesting toxic effects of oil. It was concluded that tolerance to oil relates to flooding tolerance when measured in terms of biochemical enzyme activity. Root alcohol dehydrogenase activity was a sensitive indicator of oil susceptibility, whereas leaf-level photosynthesis was less sensitive to oil. Relating flooding and oil tolerance based on physiological measures could help future efforts to protect marsh plants prior to an oil spill as well as manage coastal marshes following an oil spill.

TI  - Rapid enhancement of multiple ecosystem services following the restoration of a coastal foundation species
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global decline of marine foundation species (kelp forests, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) has contributed to the degradation of the coastal zone and threatens the loss of critical ecosystem services and functions. Restoration of marine foundation species has had variable success, especially for seagrasses, where a majority of restoration efforts have failed. While most seagrass restorations track structural attributes over time, rarely do restorations assess the suite of ecological functions that may be affected by restoration. Here we report on the results of two small-scale experimental seagrass restoration efforts in a central California estuary where we transplanted 117 0.25-m(2) plots (2,340 shoots) of the seagrass species Zostera marina. We quantified restoration success relative to persistent reference beds, and in comparison to unrestored, unvegetated areas. Within three years, our restored plots expanded similar to 8,500%, from a total initial area of 29 to 2,513 m(2). The restored beds rapidly began to resemble the reference beds in (1) seagrass structural attributes (canopy height, shoot density, biomass), (2) ecological functions (macrofaunal species richness and abundance, epifaunal species richness, nursery function), and (3) biogeochemical functions (modulation of water quality). We also developed a multifunctionality index to assess cumulative functional performance, which revealed restored plots are intermediate between reference and unvegetated habitats, illustrating how rapidly multiple functions recovered over a short time period. Our comprehensive study is one of few published studies to quantify how seagrass restoration can enhance both biological and biogeochemical functions. Our study serves as a model for quantifying ecosystem services associated with the restoration of a foundation species and demonstrates the potential for rapid functional recovery that can be achieved through targeted restoration of fast-growing foundation species under suitable conditions.

T2  - ARAB GULF JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study provides estimates of the vegetation structure and its plant communities in the coastal salt marshes between Damietta and Port Said, to determine the factor or factors controlling the species distribution and to correlate the vegetational gradients with the edaphic factors.  Five major communities constitute the major part of the natural vegetation of the study area and are dominated by five perennials:Zygophyllum acgyptium A. Hosny, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moric.) Moris and Delmonte, Halocnemum strobilaceum (Pallas) M. Bieb., Juncus acutus L. and Juncus rigidus Desf.  Therophytes are the most frequent life-form in these communities.  The results of this study confirm the presence of a Mediterranean floristic territory in Egypt.  Analysis of the correlation between the vegetational gradients and the edaphic factors shows that calcium carbonate, organic carbon, sulfate, bicarbonate and potassium are the main operating edaphic factors in this habitat.

TI  - Salt Marsh Pond Biogeochemistry Changes Hourly-to-Yearly but Does Not Scale With Dimensions or Geospatial Position
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow ponds are expanding in many salt marshes with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning. Determining how pond characteristics change over time and scale with physical dimensions and other spatial predictors could facilitate incorporation of ponds into projections of ecosystem change. We evaluated scaling relationships across six differently sized ponds in three regions of the high marshes within the Plum Island Ecosystems-Long Term Ecological Research site (MA, USA). We further characterized diel fluctuations in surface water chemistry in two ponds to understand short-term processes that affect emergent properties (e.g., habitat suitability). Primary producers drove oxygen levels to supersaturation during the day, while nighttime respiration resulted in hypoxic to anoxic conditions. Diel swings in oxygen were mirrored by pH and resulted in successive shifts in redox-sensitive metabolisms, as indicated by nitrate consumption at dusk followed by peaks in ammonium and then sulfide overnight. Abundances of macroalgae and Ruppia maritima correlated with whole-pond oxygen metabolism rates, but not with surface area (SA), volume (V), or SA:V. Moreover, there were no clear patterns in primary producer abundances, surface water chemistry, or pond metabolism rates across marsh regions supplied by different tidal creeks or that differed in distance to upland borders or creekbanks. Comparisons with data from 2 years prior demonstrate that plant communities and biogeochemical processes are not in steady state. Factors contributing to variability between ponds and years are unclear but likely include infrequent tidal exchange. Temporal and spatial variability and the absence of scaling relationships complicate the integration of high marsh ponds into ecosystem biogeochemical models.

TI  - Table_1_Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries.xlsx
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or blue carbon systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402  78, 830  109, and 723  100 Mg C ha-1, respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha-1) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574  118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

AB  - The growth response of Dutch salt marsh species (C3 and C4) to atmospheric CO2 enrichment was investigated. Tillers of the C3 species Elymus athericus were grown in combinations of 380 and 720 mul l-1 CO2 and low (0) and high (300 mM NaCl) soil salinity. CO2 enrichment increased dry matter production and leaf area development while both parameters were reduced at high salinity. The relative growth response to CO2 enrichment was higher under saline conditions. Growth increase at elevated CO2 was higher after 34 than 71 days. A lower response to CO2 enrichment after 71 days was associated with a decreased specific leaf area (SLA). In two other experiments the effect of CO2 (380 and 720 mul l-1) on growth of the C4 species Spartina anglica was studied. In the first experiment total plant dry weight was reduced by 20% at elevated CO2. SLA also decreased at high CO2. The effect of elevated CO2 was also studied in combination with soil salinity (50 and 400 mM NaCl) and flooding. Again plant weight was reduced (10%) at elevated CO2, except under the combined treatment high salinity/non-flooded. But these effects were not significant. High salinity reduced total plant weight while flooding had no effect. Causes of the salinity-dependent effect of CO2 enrichment on growth and consequences of elevated CO2 for competition between C3 and C4 species are discussed.

TI  - Seasonal variability of denitrification efficiency in northern salt marshes: An example from the St. Lawrence Estuary
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal ecosystems, denitrification is a key process in removing excess dissolved nitrogen oxides and participating in the control of eutrophication process. Little is known about the role of salt marshes on nitrogen budgets in cold weather coastal areas. Although coastal salt marshes are important sites for organic matter degradation and nutrient regeneration, bacterial-mediated nitrogen cycling processes, such as denitrification, remain unknown in northern and sub-arctic regions, especially under winter conditions. Using labelled nitrogen (N-15), denitrification rates were measured in an eastern Canadian salt marsh in August, October and December 2005. Freshly sampled undisturbed sediment cores were incubated over 8 h and maintained at their sampling temperatures to evaluate the influence of low temperatures on the denitrification rate. From 2 to 12 degrees C, average denitrification rate and dissolved oxygen consumption increased from 9.6 to 25.5 mu mol N-2 m(-2) h(-1) and from 1.3 to 1-8 mmol O-2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with no statistical dependence of temperature (p > 0.05). Nitrification has been identified as the major nitrate source for denitrification, supplying more than 80% of the nitrate demand. Because no more than 31% of the nitrate removed by sediment is estimated to be denitrified, the presence of a major nitrate sink in sediment is suspected. Among possible nitrate consumption mechanisms, dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium, metal and organic matter oxidation processes are discussed. providing the first measurements of denitrification rate in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh, this study evidences the necessity of preserving and restoring marshes. They constitute an efficient geochemical filter against an excess of nitrate dispersion to coastal waters even under cold northern conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Methane production by soils from different Louisiana marsh vegetation types
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated quantitative indices (soil organic matter, labile C, and sulfate concentrations) correlated with methane production rates along related vegetation and salinity gradients in the Louisiana coastal marsh region. Expressed on a soil dry mass basis, soil labile C was the variable most closely correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.69). Expressed on a surface area basis, labile C and SO42- were both significantly correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.36). Lower CH, production rates in saline marshes were attributed to higher SO42- content per unit area. This effect was confounded with the effect of plant species changes along the salinity gradient. Soils under Spartina patens produced less CH4 if collected from brackish marshes than from less saline intermediate marshes. Thus, variation in CH4 production across the broader gradient was not a result of plant species changes alone. Laboratory production data such as this can be useful in designing sampling schemes for future studies of field CH4 emissions.

AB  - Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating techniques are used to characterize recent peat accumulation rates of alpine peatlands located in Zoige, Tibetan plateau. Several cores were collected in different parts of the peatlands. Cores were Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated, and these data were used to calculate sediment accumulation rates. Ranges of dry mass accumulation rates were 0.021 similar to 0.048 g cm(-2) yr(-1) (the mean value is 0.033 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). The mean sediment fluxes of SOC, LC and TN in the marsh soil were 113 g m(-2) yr(-1), 12 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 5 g m(-2) yr(-1) seperatly during 1952 similar to 2004 using Cs-137 and Pb-210 techenique. The changes of SOC, TN and LC accumulation flux were similar with that of the temperature of May. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effect of oxygen availability and salinity on early life history stages of salt marsh plants .2. Early seedling development advantage of Spartina alterniflora over Phragmites australis (Poaceae)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - In salt marsh soils, germination and the first phases of seedling development often occur under dark, hypoxic or anoxic, and saline conditions. Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis seedling development were examined under covaried oxygen and salinity concentrations in growth chamber experiments. First, the effects of oxygen and salinity on seedling development were tested in the dark, using a 5 X 5 factorial design. Oxygen did not affect P. australis plumule growth at oxygen concentrations from 21 down to 2.5%. Plumules were longer at less than or equal to 10 than at greater than or equal to 25 g NaCl/L. Root growth was maximum in 21% oxygen, at less than or equal to 10 g NaCl/L and reduced at all salinities in oxygen concentrations less than or equal to 10%. No plumule or root growth occurred under anoxia. Salinity did not affect S. alterniflora mesocotyl emergence, which was fastest in anoxia and hypoxia. Mesocotyls did not emerge from the spikelet in 21% oxygen. In contrast, plumule growth was fastest in 21% oxygen, but was inhibited in anoxia. Under low oxygen and high salinity both plumule and root elongation were reduced. Coleoptile and mesocotyl elongation were greatest in 2.5 and 5% oxygen, and shortest in anoxia. The percentage of mesocotyls elongating was also highest in 2.5% oxygen. Rapid S. alterniflora coleoptile and mesocotyl elongation in anoxia enables its seedlings to escape the impact of the stressful environment where its seeds can germinate, but the seedlings could not survive otherwise. In separate experiments, S. alterniflora seeds were germinated and the seedlings grown in the dark for 10 d, then exposed to light for 4 d. Prior to illumination the seedlings did not develop beyond the stage of a small plumule enclosed in the coleoptile. Within 48 h of illumination in the presence of CO2, roots emerged and the plumule elongated inside the coleoptile at salinities up to 40 g NaCl/L, while the external environment remained anoxic. Without CO2, plumule growth and root development did not occur. This suggested oxygen was produced inside the coleoptile by the photosynthesizing plumule, and triggered root development. The ability of S. alterniflora seedlings to continue development under external anoxia and high salinity gives that species a competitive advantage over P. australis in high salinity and/or poorly drained marshes.

TI  - Effects of long-term grazing on sediment deposition and salt-marsh accretion rates
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have attempted to predict whether coastal marshes will be able to keep up with future acceleration of sea-level rise by estimating marsh accretion rates. However, there are few studies focussing on the long-term effects of herbivores on vegetation structure and subsequent effects on marsh accretion. Deposition of fine-grained, mineral sediment during tidal inundations, together with organic matter accumulation from the local vegetation, positively affects accretion rates of marsh surfaces. Tall vegetation can enhance sediment deposition by reducing current flow and wave action. Herbivores shorten vegetation height and this could potentially reduce sediment deposition. This study estimated the effects of herbivores on 1) vegetation height, 2) sediment deposition and 3) resulting marsh accretion after long-term (at least 16 years) herbivore exclusion of both small (i.e. hare and goose) and large grazers (i.e. cattle) for marshes of different ages. Our results firstly showed that both small and large herbivores can have a major impact on vegetation height. Secondly, grazing processes did not affect sediment deposition. Finally, trampling by large grazers affected marsh accretion rates by compacting the soil. In many European marshes, grazing is used as a tool in nature management as well as for agricultural purposes. Thus, we propose that soil compaction by large grazers should be taken in account when estimating the ability of coastal systems to cope with an accelerating sea-level rise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Combining Multi-Indices by Neural Network Model for Estimating Canopy Chlorophyll Content: a Case Study of Interspecies Competition between Spartina alternflora and Phragmites australis
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive species Spartina alterniflora show a significant coexistence zonation pattern with local Phragmites australis in different mixture ratio, increasing the difficulty to monitor their distribution directly by remote sensing. Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is an important indicator to monitor the growth and physiological status. The objective of this study was to estimate CCC under different mixture ratio. Five spectral indices were selected and combined via back propagation (BP) neural network model for estimating CCC. Combining multi-indices yielded better results (R-2 = 0.7729, RAISE = 53.01 ug.cm(-2)) on average than the best single spectral index (R-2 = 0.7190, RAISE = 63.53 ug.cm(-2)) without distinguishing interspecies competition, with a total increase of 7.5% in the R-2 and a decrease of 16.56% in the RAISE. Meanwhile, when considering interspecies competition, the estimating results obtained by the BP neural network model achieved a further improvement of the R-2 value, ranging from 3.57% to 20.37%, while the prediction error reduced at varying degrees (maximum reduction of 23.78%). The results indicate that combining multi-indices by BP neural network model can alleviate the influence of interspecies competition and achieve higher estimating accuracy.

TI  - Topographical, soil, and water determinants of the Vallevecchia coastal dune-marsh system
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their low elevation range, coastal environments are extremely sensitive to rising sea levels resulting from climate change and other direct human impacts. Increased knowledge about site and vegetation characteristics can contribute to improving their conservation and restoration. A survey of 51 sampling areas and seven transects in the sand dune, salt marsh system of Vallevecchia (Caorle, Italy) was conducted, while taking into account the vegetation and certain important topographical, soil, and hydrological characteristics. The most important factors differentiating the presence of sand dunes and salt marsh vegetation were found to be soil electric conductivity (EC: threshold EC=0.4 mS cm(-1)) and site elevation (threshold + 0.70 cm a.s.l.). In psammophilous vegetation, the soil pH and EC decreased with elevation and the water table was composed of freshwater. A small amount of salt accumulation was found only at the white dune bottom. In salt marsh vegetation, the soils were flooded daily by high tides and were saline and alkaline at higher elevations, where less frequent tide flooding led to frequent soil drying and salt accumulation. The soil OM content of the salt marshes was highest due to the slow mineralization rate as a consequence of the high water content. The current low sediment transport from adjacent rivers was the cause of the regression of the central-eastern part of Vallevecchia, where the dunal system width and number of vegetation types decreased and the height and mean slope of the sea facing sides of the white dunes increased. The 60-cm local sea level rise predicted by 2100 will increase the salt marsh extent by 60%, which will be a disadvantage for the more rare non-saline retro-dunal and psammophilous vegetation. Reactivating river sediment transport, reducing or eliminating the deep-rooted pine and Ammophila arenaria plantations and closing drainage ditches in the adjacent pinewoods can mitigate the negative impacts of sea level rise.

TI  - Experimental removal of wetland emergent vegetation leads to decreased methylmercury production in surface sediment
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed plant removal (devegetation) experiments across a suite of ecologically diverse wetland settings (tidal salt marshes, river floodplain, rotational rice fields, and freshwater wetlands with permanent or seasonal flooding) to determine the extent to which the presence (or absence) of actively growing plants influences the activity of the Hg(II)-methylating microbial community and the availability of Hg(II) to those microbes. Vegetated control plots were paired with neighboring devegetated plots in which photosynthetic input was terminated 4-8 months prior to measurements, through clipping aboveground biomass, severing belowground connections, and shading the sediment surface to prevent regrowth. Across all wetlands, devegetation decreased the activity of the Hg(II)-methylating microbial community (k(meth)) by 38%, calculated MeHg production potential (MP) rates by 36%, and pore water acetate concentration by 78%. Decreases in MP were associated with decreases in microbial sulfate reduction in salt marsh settings. In freshwater agricultural wetlands, decreases in MP were related to indices of microbial iron reduction. Sediment MeHg concentrations were also significantly lower in devegetated than in vegetated plots in most wetland settings studied. Devegetation effects were correlated with live root density (percent volume) and were most profound in vegetated sites with higher initial pore water acetate concentrations. Densely rooted wetlands had the highest rates of microbial Hg(II)-methylation activity but often the lowest concentrations of bioavailable reactive Hg(II). We conclude that the exudation of labile organic carbon (e. g., acetate) by plants leads to enhanced microbial sulfate and iron reduction activity in the rhizosphere, which results in high rates of microbial Hg(II)-methyation and high MeHg concentrations in wetland sediment.

T2  - Journal of Ecology and Environment
M3  - research-article
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO₂ affects the soil carbon cycle by influencing microbial activity and the carbon pool. In this study, the effects of elevated CO₂ on extracellular enzyme activities (EEA; β-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase,aminopeptidase) in salt marsh sediment vegetated with Suaeda japonica were assessed under ambient atmospheric CO₂ concentration (380 ppm) or elevated CO₂ concentration (760 ppm) conditions. Additionally, the community structure of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was analyzed via terminal restriction fragments length polymorphism (T-RFLP).Sediment with S. japonica samples were collected from the Hwangsando intertidal flat in May 2005, and placed in small pots (diameter 6 cm, height 10 cm). The pots were incubated for 60 days in a growth chamber under two different CO₂concentration conditions. Sediment samples for all measurements were subdivided into two parts: surface (0-2 cm)and rhizome (4-6 cm) soils. No significant differences were detected in EEA with different CO₂ treatments in the surface and rhizome soils. However, the ratio of β-glucosidase activity to N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in rhizome soil was significantly lower (P < 0.01) at 760 ppm CO₂ than at 380 ppm CO₂, thereby suggesting that the contribution of fungi to the decomposition of soil organic matter might in some cases prove larger than that of bacteria. Community structures of SRB were separated according to different CO₂ treatments, suggesting that elevated CO₂ may affect the carbon and sulfur cycle in salt marshes.

TI  - Carbon burial records during the last similar to 40,000 years in sediments of the Liaohe Delta wetland, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Delta wetland sediments constitute a long-term natural carbon sink and play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. In this study, borehole core ZK3 (36.7-m long), drilled in 2012 in the Liaohe Delta wetland, was investigated to assess the rate of carbon sequestration and the factors influencing carbon burial since the Late Pleistocene. Here we report the results of integrated analyses of the core, including its sedimentary lithology, grain size, foraminiferal abundance, chemical elements, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. The sedimentary environment has evolved from a fluvial-deposit, limnetic-deposit, littoral-deposit, shallow sea deposit, and finally to a delta-deposit environment since 40,000 cal yr BP. Environmentally induced differences in apparent mass accumulation rates (AMARs) of organic carbon (OC) have been significant; they have ranged between 3.73 and 30.77 g/(m(2)yr). The fact that the highest rates were associated with the delta-deposit environment indicates that the rate of carbon sequestration was greater in the sediments of estuarine wetlands than sediments of the continental shelf. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) proxy responded to several cold events, and there was a positive correlation between the CIA and OC-AMAR. Climate may therefore have regulated the excursions of ecosystem productions and in turn impacted the dynamics of carbon burial.

TI  - The state of legislation and policy protecting Australia's mangrove and salt marsh and their ecosystem services
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and coastal salt marsh, provide many ecosystem services. In Australia, large areas have been lost since European colonization, particularly as a result of drainage, infilling and flood-mitigation works, often starting in the mid-19th century and aimed primarily towards converting land to agricultural, urban or industrial uses. These threats remain ongoing, and will be exacerbated by rapid population growth and climate change in the 21st century. Establishing the effect of wetland loss on the delivery of ecosystem services is confounded by the absence of a nationally consistent approach to mapping wetlands and defining the boundaries of different types of coastal wetland. In addition, climate change and its projected effect on mangrove and salt marsh distribution and ecosystem services is poorly, if at all, acknowledged in existing legislation and policy. Intensifying climate change means that there is little time to be complacent; indeed, there is an urgent need for proper valuation of ecosystem services and explicit recognition of ecosystem services within policy and legislation. Seven actions are identified that could improve protection of coastal wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide, including benchmarking and improving coastal wetland extent and health, reducing complexity and inconsistency in governance arrangements, and facilitating wetland adaptation and ecosystem service delivery using a range of relevant mechanisms. Actions that build upon the momentum to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon 'blue carbon' could achieve multiple desirable objectives, including clithate-change mitigation and adaptation, floodplain rehabilitation and habitat protection.

TI  - Importance of Biogeomorphic and Spatial Properties in Assessing a Tidal Salt Marsh Vulnerability to Sea-level Rise
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the biogeomorphic processes of a large (309 ha) tidal salt marsh and examined factors that influence its ability to keep pace with relative sea-level rise (SLR). Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37 % (113 ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63 % (196 ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55 % (169 ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (< 5.5 %), with mean bulk densities of 0.58 g cm(-3), indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.

TI  - Denitrification Capacity of a Natural and a Restored Marsh in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures, such as diking, construction of dams, and oil spills negatively impact coastal marshes creating growing pressure to preserve and to restore salt marshes due to their critical role in permanently removing nitrate runoff through denitrification as well as other ecosystem services they provide. This study determined denitrification rates across a typical northern Gulf of Mexico salt marsh landscape that included a natural marsh, a tidal creek, and a 21-year-old restored salt marsh. Denitrification capacity, measured with the isotope pairing technique on a membrane inlet mass spectrometer, was comparable across the sites despite significant differences in above and below ground characteristics. Total extractable ammonium concentrations and sediment carbon content were higher at the natural marsh compared to the restored marsh. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were highest at the creek compared to the vegetated sites and lowest at the restored marsh. This suggests that marsh restoration projects reestablish nitrogen removal capacity at rates similar to those in natural systems and can help to significantly reduce nitrogen loads to the coastal ocean.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - PHYTOGENIC mounds (nebkhas) formed by halophytes are widely distributed in coastal and desert environments. Such nebkhas provide loci for geochemical and biological activities that influence ecosystem processes and function. Seasonal variation in soil and bacterial properties were investigated within the nebkhas under the canopy of Halocnemum strobilaceum and in the surrounding unvegetated sites at salt marshes of Lake Manzala. The parameters measured include soil moisture, organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bacterial community and enzyme characteristics. Enrichment ratios for soil salinity and nutrients were evaluated to indicate the salinity and fertility islands within nebkhas. Soil moisture content showed significant differences between the different seasons with the highest value in winter (16.55%) at unvegetated control site. Soil electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and phosphorus had their significantly higher values in nebkhas during autumn. The enrichment values for the measured soil parameters ranged from 0.31 to 4.09 in the four seasons which indicates a clear accumulation effect for soil nutrients and salts within the nebkhas under the canopy of H. strobilaceum. Bacterial abundance was consistently higher in nebkhas through all seasons. Eleven genera of bacteria belong to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and proteobacteria phyla were recorded in nebkha and unvegetated sites. These genera varied in their occurrence between the two locations and the four seasons. It can be concluded that the formation of nebkhas by halophytic vegetation have noticeable effects on accumulation of soil salinity and fertility during different seasons that affect bacterial abundance and activity in coastal environment.

TI  - Multi-scale segregations and edaphic determinants of marsh plant communities in a western Pacific estuary
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether and how the roles of environmental factors in producing vegetation patterns in coastal marshes vary with spatial scale is not well understood. We investigated the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors in the Yangtze estuary at three spatial scales. Plant communities and edaphic factors were quantified at high and low tidal levels in both freshwater and salt marshes. Canonical correspondence analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors at the landscape scale (freshwater vs. salt marsh), the zonation scale (high vs. low tidal level) and the patch scale (dominant vs. other species). Soil salinity, moisture content, pH, bulk density, and organic carbon could well explain segregations of plants at the landscape and zonation scales. However, the same factors exhibited only very weak relationships to plant communities at the patch scale. These results suggest that plant communities in the Yangtze estuary are segregated at different spatial scales by different environmental factors. As spatial scale is often not explicitly addressed investigating community assembly rules, our study underscores the importance of scaling for an improved understanding of community organization in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Salt marsh vegetation as a carbonyl sulfide (COS) source to the atmosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is the most abundant and longest-lived reduced sulfur compound in the atmosphere; changes in its atmospheric concentration could significantly affect global climate and the biogeochemical sulfur cycle. The largest sink of COS in the troposphere is its destruction in plant leaves by the enzymes involved in photosynthesis. In this study, net fluxes of COS were measured from a coastal salt marsh on a subtropical barrier island on the Texas shore of the Gulf of Mexico. We find net emissions from sites with the common salt marsh plant Batis maritima compared to the net uptake from vegetated plots of most previously investigated biomes. The magnitude of the COS production from vegetated plots in this study was twice the emissions of soil-only salt marsh plots. This is the first time that emissions of COS have been found to be significantly enhanced by the presence of vegetation compared to soil alone. COS fluxes exceeded +110 pmol m(-2) s(-1) for non-inundated plots during daytime hours and were correlated with soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm. Tidal flooding inhibited soil COS exchange; however, we found continued net emissions from emergent B. maritima. This study suggests that emissions of COS resulted from interactions with the plants themselves, which would mean that B. maritima can mediate the production of atmospheric COS.

TI  - Comparison of fine root biomass and soil organic carbon stock between exotic and native mangrove
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala has been widely used to increase the mangrove area in China. Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.

TI  - Modeling Tidal Marsh Distribution with Sea-Level Rise: Evaluating the Role of Vegetation, Sediment, and Upland Habitat in Marsh Resiliency
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes maintain elevation relative to sea level through accumulation of mineral and organic matter, yet this dynamic accumulation feedback mechanism has not been modeled widely in the context of accelerated sea-level rise. Uncertainties exist about tidal marsh resiliency to accelerated sea-level rise, reduced sediment supply, reduced plant productivity under increased inundation, and limited upland habitat for marsh migration. We examined marsh resiliency under these uncertainties using the Marsh Equilibrium Model, a mechanistic, elevation-based soil cohort model, using a rich data set of plant productivity and physical properties from sites across the estuarine salinity gradient. Four tidal marshes were chosen along this gradient: two islands and two with adjacent uplands. Varying century sea-level rise (52, 100, 165, 180 cm) and suspended sediment concentrations (100%, 50%, and 25% of current concentrations), we simulated marsh accretion across vegetated elevations for 100 years, applying the results to high spatial resolution digital elevation models to quantify potential changes in marsh distributions. At low rates of sea-level rise and mid-high sediment concentrations, all marshes maintained vegetated elevations indicative of mid/high marsh habitat. With century sea-level rise at 100 and 165 cm, marshes shifted to low marsh elevations; mid/high marsh elevations were found only in former uplands. At the highest century sea-level rise and lowest sediment concentrations, the island marshes became dominated by mudflat elevations. Under the same sediment concentrations, low salinity brackish marshes containing highly productive vegetation had slower elevation loss compared to more saline sites with lower productivity. A similar trend was documented when comparing against a marsh accretion model that did not model vegetation feedbacks. Elevation predictions using the Marsh Equilibrium Model highlight the importance of including vegetation responses to sea-level rise. These results also emphasize the importance of adjacent uplands for long-term marsh survival and incorporating such areas in conservation planning efforts.

TI  - Spatial gradients in dissolved carbon due to tidal marsh outwelling into a Chesapeake Bay estuary
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes have been previously shown to affect fluxes of carbon and nutrients in adjacent estuaries by acting as sources, sinks or transformers of compounds transported in water exchanged between the marsh and estuary. Relative to information on the amount and direction of these exchanges, much less is known about the distribution and fate of the distinctive dissolved organic compounds derived from marshes, and the spatial extent to which this 'marsh signature' affects optical and biogeochemical variability in the estuary. In the present study we address the spatial distribution of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as other biogeochemical components, in the Rhode River estuary-marsh complex of the Chesapeake Bay. High-spatial-resolution transects showed that the marshes are a major source of DOC, DIC and pCO(2) to the adjacent estuary and atmosphere, and that they seem to trap algae and other suspended particulate matter while releasing high-molecular-weight, aromatic-rich, highly colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into the estuary through tidal flushing. These processes result in strong variability in water characteristics considerably beyond the marsh-estuary interface. Non-conservative mixing in CDOM with salinity was probably due to both intense processing of the more labile marsh-exported components, as well as to mixing with other terrestrial and wetland inputs into the estuary. Despite the possible role of the adjacent subtidal mudflat as a sink for some of the material released from the marshes, the marsh signature was distinguishable from the regional estuarine background over a distance of more than 1 km into the river.

TI  - NUMERICAL MODELS OF SALT MARSH EVOLUTION: ECOLOGICAL, GEOMORPHIC, AND CLIMATIC FACTORS
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Salt marshes are delicate landforms at the boundary between the sea and land. These ecosystems support a diverse biota that modifies the erosive characteristics of the substrate and mediates sediment transport processes. Here we present a broad overview of recent numerical models that quantify the formation and evolution of salt marshes under different physical and ecological drivers. In particular, we focus on the coupling between geomorphological and ecological processes and on how these feedbacks are included in predictive models of landform evolution. We describe in detail models that simulate fluxes of water, organic matter, and sediments in salt marshes. The interplay between biological and morphological processes often produces a distinct scarp between salt marshes and tidal flats. Numerical models can capture the dynamics of this boundary and the progradation or regression of the marsh in time. Tidal channels are also key features of the marsh landscape, flooding and draining the marsh platform and providing a source of sediments and nutrients to the marsh ecosystem. In recent years, several numerical models have been developed to describe the morphogenesis and long-term dynamics of salt marsh channels. Finally, salt marshes are highly sensitive to the effects of long-term climatic change. We therefore discuss in detail how numerical models have been used to determine salt marsh survival under different scenarios of sea level rise.

TI  - Restoration of Cordgrass Salt Marshes: Limited Effects of Organic Matter Additions on Nitrogen Fixation
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive loss of tidal marsh habitat surrounding the San Francisco Bay has led to numerous restoration projects to restore ecosystem function. Native cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) is important for sediment accumulation and nesting habitat for endangered California Ridgway's Rail (Rallus obsoletus obsoletus), and because salt marshes are typically nitrogen-limited ecosystems, previous restoration studies in California have used nitrogen fertilizers to increase plant growth. This study compared the use of two low-nitrogen, high-carbon fertilizers (Macrosystis pyrifera (kelp) and sodium alginate) to stimulate N-2-fixing bacteria inhabiting the S. foliosa rhizosphere in a historic and recently restored marsh in San Francisco Bay. Alginate increased N-2-fixation, though there was no observed S. foliosa growth response. Kelp suppressed N-2-fixation, and increased the foliar nitrogen content of Salicornia pacifica in mixed Spartina-Salicornia stands. The restored marsh had less than 0.5 mu M phosphate in porewaters, suggesting phosphorus, not nitrogen, limits S. foliosa growth in this marsh. Alginate increased rates of N-2-fixation and may promote plant growth in marshes exhibiting nitrogen limitation. Phosphate limitation was a surprise considering numerous previous studies indicate nitrogen as the primary limiting nutrient of tidal marsh plants. We recommend first assessing nutrient stoichiometry when considering manipulations to promote plant growth in restored marshes.

TI  - Soil stabilization linked to plant diversity and environmental context in coastal wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPlants play a pivotal role in soil stabilization, with above-ground vegetation and roots combining to physically protect soil against erosion. It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity. Diversity effects are more pronounced in biogeographical contexts where soils are erosion-prone (sandy, low organic content), suggesting that the pervasive influence of biodiversity on environmental processes also applies to the ecosystem service of erosion protection.

TI  - Ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa population response to living shoreline design and ecosystem development
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal communities increasingly invest in natural and nature-based features (e.g., living shorelines) as a strategy to protect shorelines and enhance coastal resilience. Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2-16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: (1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, (2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and (3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

TI  - Simultaneous Catabolism of Plant-Derived Aromatic Compounds Results in Enhanced Growth for Members of the Roseobacter Lineage
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant-derived aromatic compounds are important components of the dissolved organic carbon pool in coastal salt marshes, and their mineralization by resident bacteria contributes to carbon cycling in these systems. Members of the roseobacter lineage of marine bacteria are abundant in coastal salt marshes, and several characterized strains, including Sagittula stellata E-37, utilize aromatic compounds as primary growth substrates. The genome sequence of S. stellata contains multiple, potentially competing, aerobic ring-cleaving pathways. Preferential hierarchies in substrate utilization and complex transcriptional regulation have been demonstrated to be the norm in many soil bacteria that also contain multiple ring-cleaving pathways. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether substrate preference exists in S. stellata when the organism is provided a mixture of aromatic compounds that proceed through different ring-cleaving pathways. We focused on the protocatechuate (pca) and the aerobic benzoyl coenzyme A (box) pathways and the substrates known to proceed through them, p-hydroxybenzoate (POB) and benzoate, respectively. When these two substrates were provided at nonlimiting carbon concentrations, temporal patterns of cell density, gene transcript abundance, enzyme activity, and substrate concentrations indicated that S. stellata simultaneously catabolized both substrates. Furthermore, enhanced growth rates were observed when S. stellata was provided both compounds simultaneously compared to the rates of cells grown singly with an equimolar concentration of either substrate alone. This simultaneous-catabolism phenotype was also demonstrated in another lineage member, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3. These findings challenge the paradigm of sequential aromatic catabolism reported for soil bacteria and contribute to the growing body of physiological evidence demonstrating the metabolic versatility of roseobacters.

TI  - Sediment and carbon deposition vary among vegetation assemblages in a coastal salt marsh
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are dynamic, intertidal ecosystems that are increasingly being recognised for their contributions to ecosystem services, including carbon (C) accumulation and storage. The survival of salt marshes and their capacity to store C under rising sea levels, however, is partially reliant upon sedimentation rates and influenced by a combination of physical and biological factors. In this study, we use several complementary methods to assess short-term (days) deposition and medium-term (months) accretion dynamics within a single marsh that contains three salt marsh vegetation types common throughout southeastern (SE) Australia.We found that surface accretion varies among vegetation assemblages, with medium-term (19 months) bulk accretion rates in the upper marsh rush (Juncus) assemblage (1.74 +/- 0.13 mm yr(-1)) consistently in excess of estimated local sea-level rise (1.15 mm yr(-1)). Accretion rates were lower and less consistent in both the succulent (Sarcocornia, 0.78 +/- 0.18 mm yr(-1)) and grass (Sporobolus, 0.88 +/- 0.22 mm yr(-1)) assemblages located lower in the tidal frame. Short-term (6 days) experiments showed deposition within Juncus plots to be dominated by autochthonous organic inputs with C deposition rates ranging from 1.14 +/- 0.41 mg C cm(-2) d(-1) (neap tidal period) to 2.37 +/- 0.44 mg C cm(-2) d(-1) (spring tidal period), while minerogenic inputs and lower C deposition dominated Sarcocornia (0.10 +/- 0.02 to 0.62 +/- 0.08 mg C cm(-2) d(-1)) and Sporobolus (0.17 +/- 0.04 to 0.40 +/- 0.07 mg C cm(-2) d(-1)) assemblages.Elemental (C : N), isotopic (delta C-13), mid-infrared (MIR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses revealed little difference in either the source or character of materials being deposited among neap versus spring tidal periods. Instead, these analyses point to substantial redistribution of materials within the Sarcocornia and Sporobolus assemblages, compared to high retention and preservation of organic inputs in the Juncus assemblage. By combining medium-term accretion quantification with short-term deposition measurements and chemical analyses, we have gained novel insights into above-ground biophysical processes that may explain previously observed regional differences in surface dynamics among key salt marsh vegetation assemblages. Our results suggest that Sarcocornia and Sporobolus assemblages may be particularly susceptible to changes in sea level, though quantification of below-ground processes (e.g. root production, compaction) is needed to confirm this.

TI  - Co-regulation of rainfall amount and timing on soil carbon mineralization in a typical salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta, China.
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Studying the effects of rainfall regimes such as rainfall amount and timing on soil carbon mineralization is of great importance for our understanding the mechanisms underlying the stability and accumulation of soil carbon in coastal salt marshes. In this study, we examined the responses of soil carbon mineralization (CO2 and CH4 fluxes) from undisturbed soil columns to rainfall events in different seasons (dry and wet seasons) with filed experiments in a primary Suaeda salsa region in the Yellow River Delta salt-marsh wetland, which is far away from the coast and not affected by tides. The results showed that rainfall amount and timing had a significant interaction in affecting soil CO2 flux rates. During the dry season, large rainfall events significantly reduced soil CO2 flux rates but had no significant effect in the wet season, which might be closely related to the significant increase in soil water content and salinity. Rainfall amount, rainfall timing and their interactions had no significant effect on soil CH4 efflux rates. Rainfall timing and rainfall amount did not affect CH4/CO2. CH4/CO2 increased with increasing soil water content and salinity. Soil water content and soil salinity showed similar increases to increasing rainfall amount. Our results suggested that the changing rainfall regime under climate change in the future would have a great impact on soil carbon mineralization and carbon sink function by regulating soil water and salt migration in this region.
AB  - 研究降雨格局(如降雨量和降雨时间)对滨海盐沼湿地土壤碳矿化的影响,对于深入理解土壤碳的稳定性和积累机制具有重要意义。本研究选取远离海岸且不受潮汐影响的黄河三角洲原生盐地碱蓬盐沼湿地为对象,通过野外原状土柱的控制试验,分析土壤碳矿化(CO2和CH4通量)在不同时期(干旱期和湿润期)对降雨事件的响应。结果表明: 降雨时间和降雨量对土壤CO2通量的影响存在交互作用。在干旱期,大降雨事件显著降低了土壤CO2通量;而湿润期的降雨事件对土壤CO2通量没有显著影响,这可能与盐沼湿地的水盐运移有关。降雨量、降雨时间及其交互作用均对土壤CH4通量没有显著影响。降雨时间和降雨量对CH4/CO2比率均没有显著影响,但是相关分析表明随着土壤含水量和盐分的升高,CH4/CO2比率呈升高趋势。随着降雨量的增加,土壤含水量和土壤盐分都显著增加,且两因素呈现显著的正相关关系。因此,未来该地区降雨体系改变将可能通过调控土壤水盐运移等条件对该滨海湿地土壤碳矿化和碳汇功能产生深远影响。.

TI  - The role of herbicides in the erosion of salt marshes in eastern England
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Laboratory studies and field trials were conducted to investigate the role of herbicides on saltmarsh vegetation, and their possible significance to saltmarsh erosion. Herbicide concentrations within the ranges present in the aquatic environment were found to reduce the photosynthetic efficiency and growth of both epipelic diatoms and higher saltmarsh plants in the laboratory and in situ. The addition of sublethal concentrations of herbicides resulted in decreased growth rates and photosynthetic efficiency of diatoms and photosynthetic efficiency of higher plants. Sediment stability also decreased due to a reduction in diatom EPS production. There was qualitative evidence that diatoms migrated deeper into the sediment when the surface was exposed to simazine, reducing surface sediment stability by the absence of a cohesive biofilm. Sediment loads on leaves severely reduced photosynthesis in Limonium vulgare. This, coupled with reduced carbon assimilation from the effects of herbicides, could have large negative consequences for plant productivity and over winter survival of saltmarsh plants. The data support the hypothesis that sublethal herbicide concentrations could be playing a role in the increased erosion of salt marshes that has occurred over the past 40 years.

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration by saltmarsh in Chichester Harbour, United Kingdom
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following decades of habitat loss, carbon sequestration by coastal margin habitats has been recognised for its capacity to regulate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Chichester Harbour, an estuarine complex on the South coast of the UK, is used as a case study area in this paper. Saltmarsh habitat there has declined by 60.6% from 1946 to 2018. This downward trend is predicted to continue. Extrapolated from historic habitat loss, three future saltmarsh habitat area scenarios (worst-case, average loss, best-case) are used to estimate the net carbon sequestered by saltmarsh from 2018 to 2030. Only the best-case scenario predicts a positive net carbon sequestration. Two representative carbon prices (UK policy abatement cost, and the social cost of carbon) are applied to estimate the value of the net carbon sequestered. Discount rates of 2.3% and 3.5% are also applied. Average loss scenario values range from -2,221,358.99 pound +/- 627,655.96 (abatement cost and a 2.3% discount rate) to -986,303.19 pound +/- 278,684.84 (social cost of carbon and a 3.5% discount rate). This study is the first to examine non-use values in the area. Results generated here can aid in highlighting the benefits saltmarsh habitats provide, promoting its conservation, as valuations of coastal habitats are poorly represented in management.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION OF TERRESTRIALLY DERIVED DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER ON THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES CONTINENTAL-SHELF
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved lignin-derived compounds in seawater indicate the presence of organic matter originating from vascular plants and therefore from terrestrial (upland and coastal marsh) ecosystems. We used a hydrophobic resin to concentrate lignin-rich humic substances and to determine concentrations of lignin oxidation products (vanillyl lignin phenols) for waters of the continental shelf of the southeastern U.S. Lignin phenol concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 4.2-mu-g liter-1 and accounted for 0.002-0.13% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in continental shelf waters. Dissolved lignin concentrations were generally highest near the shore and in those areas receiving greatest river and marsh discharge. Concentrations varied on both short-term (weekly) and seasonal time scales, however, indicating that the contribution of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter to the C budget of the shelf is quite variable. Salinity (> 31 parts per thousand) was significantly correlated (negatively) with lignin phenol concentrations during three of four cruises, suggesting largely conservative mixing of lignin-derived material on the shelf In selected rivers and salt marshes contributing terrestrially derived organic matter to the continental shelf, lignin phenol C accounted for 0.14-1.0% of the DOC. A simple mixing model which assumes no biological or physical sinks of lignin-derived material during transport from terrestrial sources to the shelf predicts that an average of 6-36% of nearshore DOC derives from terrestrial ecosystems, depending on whether the terrestrial end-member (lignin source) is assumed to be a river or a salt marsh, while 5-26% of inner shelf DOC and 3-18% of mid- to outer-shelf DOC is of terrestrial origin.

TI  - Biodegradation and Photodegradation of Vegetation-Derived Dissolved Organic Matter in Tidal Marsh Ecosystems
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tidal wetlands are a significant source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to coastal ecosystems, which impacts nutrient cycling, light exposure, carbon dynamics, phytoplankton activity, microbial growth, and ecosystem productivity. There is a wide variety of research on the properties and sources of DOM; however, little is known about the characteristics and degradation of DOM specifically sourced from tidal wetland plants. By conducting microbial and combined UV exposure and microbial incubation experiments of leachates from fresh and senescent plants in Chesapeake Bay wetlands, it was demonstrated that senescent material leached more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than fresh material (77.9 +/- 54.3 vs 21.6 +/- 11.8 mg DOC L-1, respectively). Degradation followed an exponential decay pattern, and the senescent material averaged 50.5 +/- 9.45% biodegradable DOC (%BDOC), or the loss of DOC due to microbial degradation. In comparison, the fresh material averaged a greater %BDOC (72.6 +/- 19.2%). Percent remaining of absorbance (83.3 +/- 26.7% for fresh, 90.1 +/- 10.8% for senescent) was greater than percent remaining DOC, indicating that colored DOM is less bioavailable than non-colored material. Concentrations of DOC leached, %BDOC, and SUVA280 varied between species, indicating that the species composition of the marsh likely impacts the quantity and quality of exported DOC. Comparing the UV + microbial to the microbial only incubations did not reveal any clear effects on %BDOC but UV exposure enhanced loss of absorbance during subsequent dark incubation. These results demonstrate the impacts of senescence on the quality and concentration of DOM leached from tidal wetland plants, and that microbes combined with UV impact the degradation of this DOM differently from microbes alone.

TI  - The Impact of Sea Embankment Reclamation on Greenhouse Gas GHG Fluxes and Stocks in Invasive Spartina alterniflora and Native Phragmites australis Wetland Marshes of East China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of embankment seawalls to limit the expansion of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alteniflora Loisel in eastern China's coastal wetlands has more than doubled in the past decades. Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes, whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China's Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased soil total organic C by 54.0% and total organic N by 73.2%, decreasing plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants' marsh. It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2% and 13.5%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 34.5% and 37.1%, respectively, in the Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment wall also significantly increased N2O emission by 48.9% in the Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2% in the Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections, whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2O were substantially different owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes' C and N sinks, potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China's wetlands. Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant expansion in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Salt marsh persistence is threatened by predicted sea-level rise
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes buffer coastlines and provide critical ecosystem services from storm protection to food provision. Worldwide, these ecosystems are in danger of disappearing if they cannot increase elevation at rates that match sea-level rise. However, the magnitude of loss to be expected is not known. A synthesis of existing records of salt marsh elevation change was conducted in order to consider the likelihood of their future persistence. This analysis indicates that many salt marshes did not keep pace with sea-level rise in the past century and kept pace even less well over the past two decades. Salt marshes experiencing higher local sea-level rise rates were less likely to be keeping pace. These results suggest that sea level rise will overwhelm most salt marshes' capacity to maintain elevation. Under the most optimistic IPCC emissions pathway, 60% of the salt marshes studied will be gaining elevation at a rate insufficient to keep pace with sea-level rise by 2100. Without mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions this potential loss could exceed 90%, which will have substantial ecological, economic, and human health consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Carbon isotopic compositions of plants and sediments of tide marshes in the San Francisco Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland sediments surrounding the San Francisco Bay Estuary contain a rich history of environmental change which can aid predictions of potential responses to future environmental change. Here we present results of a study of the stable carbon isotopic composition of modern surface sediments as they relate to the existing plant cover. The results indicate a strong correlation between the modern plant cover and the delta C-13 value of underlying surface sediments (RMS = 1.331). Reasons for residual differences between predicted and observed isotopic values of the surface soils include intraspecific changes in delta C-13 values of C3 plants, contributions to the carbon pool by algae, and effects of diagenesis on delta C-13 value of plant matter. The goal of this research is to provide a basis for interpreting isotopic data obtained from sediment cores in terms of changes in vegetation resulting from changes in environmental conditions.

TI  - Influence of Spartina Colonization on the Supply and Accumulation of Organic Carbon in Tidal Salt Marshes of Northern Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - GAO, J.; BAI, F.; YANG, Y.; GAO S.; LIU, Z., and LI, J., 2012. Influence of Spartina colonization on the supply and accumulation of organic carbon in tidal salt marshes of northern Jiangsu Province, China. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 486-498. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Two species of cordgrass (Spartina anglica Hubbard and Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) were artificially introduced to the intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province, China, in 1963 and 1982, respectively. However, as alien species, the impact of Spartina on the tidal flat ecosystem remains largely unknown. Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, two native plants in the intertidal zone of northern Jiangsu Province, China, are C3-type plants, whereas the Spartina species are C4-type plants. In this article, we investigate the vertical distribution of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic carbon isotope ratios in different ecosystems associated with the northern Jiangsu tidal flats; analyze changes in the organic carbon sources in the tidal flat sediments after Spartina colonization; compare carbon burial patterns at different evolutionary stages in the tidal flats; and discuss the effects of Spartina on organic carbon cycling over the intertidal flats on the Jiangsu, China, coast. Before the introduction of Spartina, the organic material in the intertidal sediments of the study area mainly came from a combination of marine and C3 plants. After the introduction of Spartina, the contribution of S. alternillora to the organic carbon content in the salt-marsh strata exceeded those made by marine sources and other C3 plants. On the S. anglica flat, the quantity of organic carbon originated from S. anglica was lower than from S. alternillora but was still greater than the contribution made by native C3 plants. The introduction of Spartina not only had a significant effect on primary productivity throughout the tidal flats but also enhanced the organic carbon accumulation rate in the sediment.

TI  - Salt marsh restoration: an overview of techniques and success indicators
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coastal wetlands including salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They are known for improving the quality of coastal water and provisioning coastal fisheries. However, this ecosystem is under potential threat due to urban coastal land reclamation, limited sediment supply, increased nutrient/eutrophication, and sea level rise. Therefore, restoration efforts to protect the degraded salt marsh habitat are considerably increasing worldwide. In this paper, we present an overview of salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. Published scientific literature in English language was collected by searching the most relevant keywords from popular search engines, namely, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Mendeley to get the information about salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. This study comprehensively reviewed data from 78 peer-reviewed papers. Results indicated that much of the salt marsh was restored through assisted abiotic strategies (e.g., recovery of tidal exchange, managed realignment, and sediment level amendment). A total of 214 indicators were found, spanning over six major ecological attributes such as structural diversity, ecosystem functions, physical conditions, species composition, external exchange, and absence of threat. Author keywords analysis revealed several hotspots for recent research (e.g., 16 s rRNA, fungi, microbial communities, carbon accumulation, and blue carbon). This paper proposes a model for restoring degraded salt marsh, as well as tracking their success. The information presented here will assist the marine ecosystem restoration practitioners in getting a comprehensive understanding of salt marsh restoration success evaluation.

TI  - Abundance and speciation of iron across a subtropical tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron has profound influence on anaerobic organic matter oxidation and Fe-S-C biogeochemical cycling in tidal marshes. To examine the abundance and speciation of iron, six iron species (poor crystalline Fe(III), crystalline Fe(III), non-sulfidic Fe(II), porewater Fe2+, FeS, and FeS2) were investigated in a cross transect (span = 250 m, depth = similar to 1.2 m) in a tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea. The results suggested that sediment characteristics, pH, redox condition, conductivity, chloride, sulfate, and organic matter create a highly heterogeneous geochemical framework in the cross transect. Correspondingly, the zonation of iron species differed significantly across the tidal marsh. Poor crystalline Fe(III) (48 +/- 24 mu mol g 1) and crystalline Fe(III) (75 +/- 32 mu mol g 1) accumulated on the surface of the high-tide zone and decreased with elevation. The non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals (140 +/- 61 mu mol g 1) accounted for the largest proportion of the six iron species. The porewater Fe2+ was enriched within the deep layer of the upland region (pH = 6.2-6.5) and exhibited a maximum of 11.49 mM. The aqueous sulfide concentration was below detection. FeS (39 +/- 6 mu mol g 1) and FeS2 (57 +/- 25 mu mol g 1) accumulated closer to the lower extremity. Tidal water brought O-2 and removed certain amounts of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and Fe(III)-bearing particles in an element budget during tidal inundation. Variations of topography, tidal hydrology, seawater intrusion, and organic matter altered the dominant organic matter oxidation pathway and further affected iron mineralization.

CP  - Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology
CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - Now that we are beginning to understand that the balance of nature is a pulsing one and not a steady-state as is the case at the organism level (i.e., homeorhesis rather than homeostasis) estuaries become important sites for research because they pulse so strongly. The external tidal pulses interface in a complex manner with internal biological and life history pulses. I review the concept that productivity of near shore ocean waters can be enhanced not only by upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters but also by outwelling of nutrients and organic matter from fertile estuaries. I conclude 1) that the extent of the latter depends on the level of production within the estuary, the tidal amplitude and the geomorphology of the estuarine landscape and 2) the outwelling from tidal marshes where it occurs is often intermittent and largest during rain storms and storm tides.

TI  - Effects of vertebrate herbivores on soil processes, plant biomass, litter accumulation and soil elevation changes in a coastal marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 Submergence of coastal wetlands in Louisiana is currently rapid and widespread. A number of factors contribute to this loss of habitat, including the activities of herbivores. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of large mammals, predominantly nutria and wild boar, on processes controlling soil elevation in coastal marshes.2 Effects of herbivores on soil and vegetation were assessed by the use of paired fenced and unfenced plots over two successive growing seasons. Above-ground biomass, Litter production, changes in soil elevation, vertical soil accretion, shallow subsidence, below-ground production of roots and rhizomes, the thickness of the root zone, soil bulk density, and soil organic matter were measured.3 Above-ground biomass, below-ground production, soil elevation and the expansion of the root zone decreased due to herbivore activity. Litter production, the rate of soil surface accretion and shallow soil subsidence were all higher in grazed compared to unrated plots, while soil organic matter and bulk density did not differ significantly between treatments.4 The results indicate that herbivores can have a negative effect on soil building processes, primarily by reducing below-ground production and expansion of the root zone. Where natural rates of mineral sediment deposition are high, coastal marshes are expected to persist, despite herbivore activities. However, where sediment inputs are substantially less, herbivores may lead to destruction of habitat.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To elucidate the influence of tidal marshes on the amount and chemical structure of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in adjacent coastal waters, surface water samples were collected along three cross-marsh transects in tidal marshes within the Changjiang Estuary. In addition, three sediment cores were collected from the marshes and incubated for 10 h in the laboratory after adding overlying tidal waters. Nutrients, DOC, absorption, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, and other parameters were measured in these samples, which clearly illustrated releases by the tidal marshes of DOC, and CDOM absorbent and fluorescent molecules. To characterize the chemical nature of the marsh-derived CDOM, variations in a suite of optical indices (including molar absorptivity, absorption spectral slope, fluorescence quantum yield, and fluorescence ratios between certain excitation/emission locations) in these samples were plotted against the offshore distance of the stations as well as the incubation time. From the literature, it has been suggested that these variations are closely associated with molecular weight, aromaticity, and humic/fulvic or allochthonous/autochthonous ratios in the CDOM mixtures. This study showed that the CDOM fluorophores changed to more humic-like and were less protein-like from sea to land across the marsh gradients. Furthermore, subtractions between EEM spectra before and after laboratory incubations were applied to illustrate in greater detail the properties of the pure fluorescent compounds exchanged at the sediment-overlying water interface.

TI  - Factors controlling sediment and nutrient fluxes in a small microtidal salt marsh within the Venice Lagoon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are among the Earth's most productive ecosystems and provide a number of ecosystem services. Water quality regulation by storing, transforming and releasing nutrients, organic matter and suspended sediment is recognized as one of the most important functions of salt marshes. The self-purification capacity of intertidal ecosystems contributes to mitigating nutrient inputs, acting as a buffer zone between watersheds and coastal waters, especially in relation to climate change and the increasing frequency of impulsive extreme events. Understanding sediment and nutrient fluxes and assessing the mechanisms that control them are valuable for the preservation and future restoration of salt marshes and for enhancing their effectiveness in providing water quality regulation services.To investigate the main driving factors in microtidal environments, changes in suspended sediment and nutrient concentrations were measured during several tidal cycles in a small microtidal reconstructed salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon, which was selected as the experimental site. The tidal amplitude, nutrients and total suspended solid concentrations were measured during 6 tidal cycles between September 2011 and October 2013. The water discharge was derived by forcing the hydrodynamic MIKE-DHI numerical model with the measured tidal levels. Fluxes were assessed by coupling field data with the calculated discharges. The salt marsh filtering function was related to the inflow matter concentrations and tidal amplitude. When high suspended solid and nutrient concentrations enter the salt marsh, accumulation processes prevail on release. In contrast, in the case of low concentrations and high tidal excursion, the salt marsh functions as a nutrient and sediment source. During all campaigns, the nitrogen removal function was more effective within the intertidal vegetated areas. Sediment release was the dominant process in the outermost creek, whereas sedimentation prevailed in the inner area of the salt marsh because of the attenuation of hydrodynamic forcing during tide propagation.

TI  - Gross nitrous oxide production drives net nitrous oxide fluxes across a salt marsh landscape
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise will change inundation regimes in salt marshes, altering redox dynamics that control nitrification - a potential source of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) - and denitrification, a major nitrogen (N) loss pathway in coastal ecosystems and both a source and sink of N2O. Measurements of net N2O fluxes alone yield little insight into the different effects of redox conditions on N2O production and consumption. We used in situ measurements of gross N2O fluxes across a salt marsh elevation gradient to determine how soil N2O emissions in coastal ecosystems may respond to future sea level rise. Soil redox declined as marsh elevation decreased, with lower soil nitrate and higher ferrous iron in the low marsh compared to the mid and high marshes (P < 0.001 for both). In addition, soil oxygen concentrations were lower in the low and mid-marshes relative to the high marsh (P < 0.001). Net N2O fluxes differed significantly among marsh zones (P = 0.009), averaging 9.8 +/- 5.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), -2.2 +/- 0.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), and 0.67 +/- 0.57 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the low, mid, and high marshes, respectively. Both net N2O release and uptake were observed in the low and high marshes, but the mid-marsh was consistently a net N2O sink. Gross N2O production was highest in the low marsh and lowest in the mid-marsh (P = 0.02), whereas gross N2O consumption did not differ among marsh zones. Thus, variability in gross N2O production rates drove the differences in net N2O flux among marsh zones. Our results suggest that future studies should focus on elucidating controls on the processes producing, rather than consuming, N2O in salt marshes to improve our predictions of changes in net N2O fluxes caused by future sea level rise.

TI  - Can thin-lipped mullet directly exploit the primary and detritic production of European macrotidal salt marshes?
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Juveniles and adults (> 100 mm) of Liza ramada colonize macrotidal salt marsh creeks of Mont Saint-Michel bay (France) between March and November, during spring tide floods (43% of the tides) and return to coastal waters during the ebb. This fish species actively feeds during its short stay in the creek (from 1 to 2 h). On average, each fish swallows sediment including living and inert organic matter, which amounts to 8% of its fresh body weight. Their diet is dominated by small benthic items (especially diatoms and salt marsh plant detritus), that correspond to the primary and detritic production of this macrotidal salt marsh creek. Despite very short submersion periods, mullets filter and ingest large quantities of sediment and concentrated organic matter (on average organic matter in stomach content is 31%) produced by these coastal wetlands. European salt marshes are thus shown to act as trophic areas for mullets, which are well adapted to this constraining habitat which is only flooded for short periods during spring tides.

TI  - Salt Marsh Sediment Biogeochemical Response to the BP Deepwater Horizon Blowout
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout on salt marshes was investigated by observing the biogeochemistry in salt marsh sediments along the Gulf Coast. High sulfide levels due to hydrocarbon loading, increased microbial activity, and microbial community shifts can lead to plant browning and mortality. Sediment biogeochemical processes that degrade enriched carbon pools through sulfate reduction are primarily responsible for the biodegradation of spilled hydrocarbons. An assessment of the impact of contamination on salt marshes at Skiff Island, LA, and Cat Island, Marsh Point, and Saltpan Island, MS, was achieved through sediment electrode profiling, microbial community profiling, and quantification of hydrocarbon contamination, which captured the spatial sedimentary biogeochemical response that affects salt marsh productivity. At western locations (Skiff and Cat Islands), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) ranged from 2183 to 2996 mg kg(-1), which was more than double the TPH concentration observed at eastern locales. At eastern study locations (e.g., Marsh Point), sedimentary pore-water H2S concentrations were higher (maximum value = 231 mg L-1) and detected further up in the sediment column than at western locales (e.g., Skiff Island). Similarly, anaerobic and aerobic microbial activity, as measured by C substrate utilization profiles and well-color development, was as high or higher at eastern locations as compared with western locations. These results indicate that other factors besides location or degree of contamination, perhaps sedimentary dynamics and physical processes specific to each marsh, should be considered when determining salt marsh response to hydrocarbon contamination.

TI  - Incorporation of Exotic Spartina alterniflora into Diet of Deposit-Feeding Snails in the Yangtze River Estuary Salt Marsh: Stable Isotope and Fatty Acid Analyses
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of deposit-feeding animals to plant invasions is still unclear, because their food sources are often difficult to identify. We examined the effect of the exotic plant species, Spartina alterniflora, on the food source composition of two dominant snail species, Assiminea latericea and Cerithidea largillierti, in the Yangtze River estuary salt marsh using a combination of stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. We collected the snails and their potential food materials (sediment organic matter, particulate organic matter, and plant material) in S. alterniflora and native plant Phragmites australis marshes and then determined the composition of food sources of snails based on fatty acid markers and stable isotope composition. Our results indicated that A. latericea and C. largillierti are deposit feeders grazing on sedimentary particles originating from diatoms, bacteria, and vascular plants. Invasive S. alterniflora did not result in a change in the relative contribution of microalgae, bacteria, and vascular plants to the food source of the snails. Spartina alterniflora was confirmed to be assimilated by both snail species. The higher assimilation of S. alterniflora by A. latericea compared with C. largillierti is probably related to the greater ability of A. latericea to assimilate plant materials from detritus, as evidenced by fatty acid composition. Overall, S. alterniflora can be incorporated into the food web of the estuarine salt marsh by the dominant snail species with generalist-feeding habits.

TI  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora changes the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh from CH4 sink to source
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in the East China Sea coast is changing the ecosystem and thus, uncertainty has hampered methane (CH4) flux accounts in these areas. To analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of the CH4 fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, four plots were established in a salt marsh of the Nanhui coast in the southern fringe of the Yangtze River estuary, differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history and including one bare mudflat. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that CH4 fluxes from the plots ranged from 1.7 to 72.2 mg m(-2) h(-1). The mature Spartina sites showed higher CH4 emission, peaking in the summer. In the mudflat CH4 consumption was observed in January and the summer. The seasonal CH4 fluxes showed positive correlation (p < 0.05) with temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation), and negative correlation (p < 0.05) with water salinity. Various diurnal cycles in the CH4 fluxes were observed at different seasons. Average CH4 emissions were higher during the daytime than at night, however, without significant difference. Thus, the CH4 fluxes started to rise at noon, and the maximum CH4 flux was observed after the ebb tide (at 18:00) during nighttime. The diurnal variation in CH4 fluxes showed a significant correlation with season but not with temperature.

TI  - CARBON, NITROGEN, AND PHOSPHORUS LEACHING RATES FROM SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA SALT MARSHES
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus leachate rates from live Spartina alterniflora Loisel in a Louisiana (USA) salt marsh were estimated to be 200, 14, and 3 g M-2, respectively, and to peak in summer and higher salinities. Leachate losses of P, N and C are equivalent to a turnover of live plant tissues of 10, 17 and 49 d, respectively, when submerged, and 148, 250 and 721 d, respectively, when unsubmerged. Plant leachate losses during marsh submergence and non-submergence are nearly equal because release rates are 15 x greater during submergence. Nitrogen and carbon concentrations relative to phosphorus are proportionately 4 x higher in leachates than in live plant tissues. The amounts released are high enough to account for measured seasonal changes in the heterotrophic rates of the estuarine plankton community. Leachates appear to be an underappreciated yet significant nutrient and carbon source for salt marsh food webs, and of potential widespread significance for many other estuarine communities.

TI  - Depth-distribution patterns and control of soil organic carbon in coastal salt marshes with different plant covers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in three kinds of salt marshes according to the vegetation covers, including Phragmites australis salt marsh (PSM), Suaeda salus salt marsh (SSM) and Tamarix chinensis-Suaeda salus salt marsh (TSSM). We applied allometric function, exponential function and logistic function to model the depth distribution of the SOCv and SOCc for each salt marsh, respectively. The results showed that the exponential function fits the depth distribution of the SOCv more well than other two functions. The SOCc can be fitted very well by all three functions for three salt marsh (Adj. R-2 > 0.99), of which the allometric function was the best one. The mean topsoil concentration factors (TCFs) of three salt marshes were beyond 0.1, which means the SOC enrichment in surface soils due to plant cycling, but TCFs in PSM were significantly higher than those in SSM (P < 0.05). Nearly 30% of SOC was concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.

TI  - Determining ecological equivalence in service-to-service scaling of salt marsh restoration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of ecological restoration required to mitigate or compensate for environmental injury or habitat loss is often based on the goal of achieving ecological equivalence. However, few tools are available for estimating the extent of restoration required to achieve habitat services equivalent to those that were lost. This paper describes habitat equivalency analysis (HEA), a habitat-based "service-to-service" approach for determining the amount of restoration needed to compensate for natural resource losses, and examines issues in its application in the case of salt marsh restoration. The scientific literature indicates that although structural attributes such as vegetation may recover within a few years, there is often a significant lag in the development of ecological processes such as nutrient cycling that are necessary for a fully functioning salt marsh. Moreover, natural variation can make recovery trajectories difficult to define and predict for many habitat services. HEA is an excellent tool for scaling restoration actions because it reflects this ecologicol variability and complexity, At the same time, practitioners must recognize that conclusions about the amount of restoration needed to provide ecological services equivalent to those that are lost will depend critically on the ecological data and assumptions that are used in the HEA calculation.

TI  - Floods and drought: Response of earthworms and potworms (Oligochaeta : Lumbricidae, Enchytraeidae) to hydrological extremes in wet grassland
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Enchytraeidae) were recorded in three floodplain meadows differing in soil type in Northern Germany during 2 years of contrasting hydrological extremes: 2002 with high precipitation, extended winter inundations and summer floods in two of the sites, and 2003 with an extraordinarily dry summer. In all sites, earthworms dominated the biomass of soil fauna, the dominant species being Octolasion tyrtaeum in marsh soil, Octolasion cyaneum in peat soil, Allolobophora chlorotica in gley soil, and Lumbricus rubellus in all three sites. The enchytraeid communities composed of 7-10 species, differed widely between sites.While the summer flood of 2002 reduced annelid populations in peat soil to zero, in gley soil only enchytraeids were sharply reduced. The earthworms there probably were less affected because of shorter duration of the flood, the lower air temperatures and SOM contents and the diapause of the dominant A. chlorotica. During summer drought in 2003, earthworms and enchytraeids were absent from gley soil, while they had maximum abundances in peat soil. The marsh soil, structured by a microrelief of shallow ditches and ridges, had highest densities of annelids. As it was not subjected to summer flooding in 2002, populations of both earthworms and potworms were stable. The drought in 2003 led to a sharp decrease in earthworm abundance in July, while the enchytraeids reached maximum values. Dynamics and survival strategies of different annelid species are discussed.The water holding capacity as well as the organic matter content of the soil are important factors for annelids in sites subjected to such hydrological extremes.To promote terrestrial annelids, controlled flooding should be kept short, especially in winters following natural summer floods. If possible, recovery times for annelids should be guarenteed, that is 2-3 months without inundations for enchytraeids and about half a year for earthworms. A microrelief with drier refuge sites can be judged as favourable for earthworms. An artificially raised groundwater table will favour annelids during drought periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in intertidal marsh: diversity and potential role in nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon is recognized as an effective agent for regulating bacterial growth and metabolism. However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the associations of QS signal molecules with the dynamics and activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria in intertidal marshes.

TI  - Sedimentation rates in flow-restricted and restored salt marshes in Long Island Sound
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many salt marshes in densely populated areas have been subjected to a reduction in tidal flow. In order to assess the impact of tidal flow restriction on marsh sedimentation processes, sediment cores were collected from flow-restricted salt marshes along the Connecticut coast of Long Island Sound. Cores were also collected from unrestricted reference marshes and from a marsh that had been previously restricted but was restored to fuller tidal flushing in the 1970's. High bulk densities and low C and N concentrations were found at depth in the restricted marsh cores, which we attribute to a period of organic matter oxidation, sediment compaction, and marsh surface subsidence upon installation of flow restrictions (between 100 and 200 years before the present, depending on the marsh). Recent sedimentation rates at the restricted marshes (as determined by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) were positive and averaged 78% (Cs-137) and 50% (Pb-210) of reference marsh sedimentation rates. The accumulation of inorganic sediment was similar at the restricted and reference marshes, perhaps because of the seasonal operation of the tide gates, while organic sediment accretion (and pore space) was significantly lower in the restricted marshes, perhaps because of higher decomposition rates. Sedimentation rates at the restored marsh were significantly higher than at the reference marshes. This marsh has responded to the higher water levels resulting from restoration by a rapid increase in marsh surface elevation.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration at a Forested Wetland Receiving Treated Municipal Effluent
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondarily treated municipal effluent has been discharged since 2006 into a 1439 ha cypress-tupelo forested wetland in coastal Louisiana. Changes in carbon stocks of trees and soils as well as emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were measured over a one-year period and compared to baseline conditions derived from the scientific literature. Methods and equations were applied from the American Carbon Registry (ACR) wetland carbon offset methodology 'Restoration of Degraded Deltaic Wetlands of the Mississippi Delta'. The cumulative carbon sequestered in the Project scenario was 4090 mt CO2e/y by trees and 13,752 mt CO2e/y by soils, while 32,982 mt CO2e/y of greenhouse gasses were emitted. The Baseline scenario sequestered 3790 mt CO2e/y by trees and 2435 mt CO2e/y by soils while emitting 70,870 mt CO2e/y in greenhouse gasses. The net difference between the Project and Baseline emissions was 11,617 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were omitted and 49,505 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were included. This study demonstrates the potential of using forested wetlands receiving treated municipal effluent for the net sequestration of carbon.

AB  - Salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of North America are characterized by having a high biomass of smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora. Because of the refractory nature of the lignocellulosic structure of this angiosperm, invertebrates utilize C from these plants with very low efficiency, if at all. This is true for both living cordgrass and post-senescent plant detritus. To balance their C demands, invertebrate consumers living in salt marshes must utilize a wide variety of other resources, including microheterotrophs (bacteria and bacterivorous flagellates) either associated with detritus or free in the water column, fungi colonizing decaying vascular plants, surface-associated algae (e.g., microphytobenthic diatoms and cyanobacteria, epiphytes, surface film algae) and phytoplankton. This high degree of trophic complexity is likely to be an important source of community stability. As an example, we estimate that ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, in a Delaware marsh must rely on a variety of different food resources since no single food type can meet their nutritional demands for either C or N. To balance their C demands, mussels appear to rely mainly on microheterotrophs, followed by phytoplankton > microphytobenthos > cellulosic detritus. Non-detrital foods are even more important for maintaining positive N balance in G. demissa. Previous and emerging evidence from other studies suggests that other important marsh consumers have a similar general diet. Although cordgrass may dominate overall rates of primary production and detritus from cordgrass contributes significantly to secondary production, we challenge the paradigm that salt marshes have a "detritus-based food web." Further research is needed to deduce the importance of microphytobenthos and microheterotrophs as sources of C and N for dominant animal consumers in these marsh systems.

TI  - Biogeochemical Implications of Episodic Impoundment in a Restored Tidal Marsh of San Francisco Bay, California
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Impounded tidal conditions often compromise coastal marsh restoration goals, through vegetation loss and other biogeochemical feedbacks. To determine if episodic marsh impoundments could be partially responsible for the observed cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) dieback at Crissy Field, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, we examined sulfur chemistry and plant stress along transects between and during tidal inlet closure events from 2007 to 2008. During closures, porewater sulfide (PW S2-) concentrations did not respond consistently among sites, nor did they increase to levels likely to cause stress damage to cordgrass (>1 mM). However, sediment solid-phase total reduced sulfur (TRS) concentrations did respond strongly to closures both at surface and subsurface depth intervals, and they were greatest in sites with high organic matter content (>5%). The temporal patterns of both PW S2- and TRS suggest that while sulfate reduction may be enhanced during closure events, the free sulfide produced is largely precipitated into solid-phase minerals. Even without millimolar levels of PW S2-, plant stress was observed during closures, as indicated by a buildup of ethanol in root tissues, a by-product of fermentative respiration brought on by limited oxygen availability. Further, enhanced sulfate reduction may be related to the higher relative concentrations of methylmercury in low intertidal surface sediments observed during closure events. These data suggest that, in support of vegetated tidal marsh restoration goals, tidal flows should be maintained actively to reduce the impact of impoundment events on marsh biogeochemistry and productivity.

TI  - The Fate of Nitrogen in Dredged Material Used for Tidal Marsh Restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marsh restoration using dredged material is being undertaken in many coastal areas to replace lost habitat and ecosystem services due to tidal marsh loss. The fate of high levels of nitrogen (N) in fine-grained dredged material used as a substrate for marsh restoration is uncertain, but if exported tidally may cause subtidal habitat degradation. In this study, a mass balance was developed to characterize N fluxes in a two-year-old restored tidal marsh constructed with fine-grained dredged material at Poplar Island, MD, in Chesapeake Bay, and to evaluate the potential impact on the adjacent submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat. Denitrification and N accumulation in Spartina organic matter were identified as the major sinks (21.31 and 28.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1), respectively), while tidal export of TN was more modest (9.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and inorganic N export was low (1.59 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Internal cycling helped retain N within the marsh. Mineralization of N associated with labile organic matter in the dredged material was likely a large, but unquantified, source of N supporting robust plant growth and N exports. Exceedances of SAV water quality habitat requirements in the subtidal region adjacent to the marsh were driven by elevated Chesapeake Bay concentrations rather than enrichment by the marsh.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon sinks by the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa at an oceanic island: Spatial variation and economic valuation
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple 'ecosystem services' in coastal waters, including carbon sequestration. However, this 'Blue Carbon' potential has been only evaluated for certain species from some areas of the world. In this study, we provide initial estimates on the magnitude and local variability of carbon sequestration, as organic carbon stocks, for seagrass meadows of Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson in the oceanic island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain, central-eastern Atlantic). Six seagrass meadows were selected; at each meadow, cores inserted up to 30 cm in the seabed were collected in the 'interior', 'edge' and 'unvegetated' bottoms immediately adjacent to seagrass patches. We estimated organic carbon (Cara) pools by means of the Loss of Ignition (LOI) procedure. Overall, larger C-org pools were observed in the 'interior' and 'edges' of meadow patches than in adjacent 'unvegetated' bottoms. At the meadow-level, C-org pools were not predicted neither by the meadow area, nor by the mean shoot density, or sediment grain fractions. Overall, the total estimated stock was 86.20 +/- 19.06 Mg C ha(-1). By considering the total potential extension of seagrass meadows across the entire island perimeter, we estimated a total stock of 60.34 Gg of C, for a mean estimated financial value of 919,432.249 (sic) (1313.47 (sic) ha(-1)), which ranges between 351,631.35 (sic) (502.33 (sic) ha(-1)) and 1,498,954.45 (sic) (2141.36 (sic) ha(-1)), according to varying market prices in the last 5 years. This work highlights, therefore, the importance of meadows underpinned by C. nodosa not only at an ecological, but also at an economic level, in particular from the perspective of regional climate change adaptation strategies.

TI  - The Effect of Fertilization on Biomass and Metabolism in North Carolina Salt Marshes: Modulated by Location-Specific Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The resilience of salt marshes to sea level rise depends on vertical accretion through belowground biomass production and sediment deposition to maintain elevation above sea level. Increased nitrogen (N) availability from anthropogenic sources may stimulate aboveground biomass production and sediment deposition and, thus, accretion; however, increased N may also negatively impact marsh accretion by decreasing belowground biomass and increasing net CO2 emissions. A study was conducted in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, to determine how responses to fertilization vary across locations with different physical and chemical characteristics. Pore water residence time, inundation time, and proximity to tidal creeks drove spatial differences in pore water sulfide, ammonium, and dissolved carbon concentrations. Although annual respiration and gross primary production were greater at the creek edge than interior marsh sites, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was nearly balanced at all the sites. Fertilization decreased belowground biomass in the interior sites but not on the creek edge. Aboveground biomass, respiration, gross primary production, and net CO2 emissions increased in response to fertilization, but responses were diminished in interior marsh locations with high pore water sulfide. Hourly NEE measured by chambers were similar to hourly NEE observed by a nearby eddy covariance tower, but correcting for inundation depth relative to plant height was critical for accurate extrapolation to annual fluxes. The impact of fertilization on biomass and NEE, and thus marsh resilience, varied across marsh locations depending upon location-specific pore water sulfide concentrations.

TI  - Distribution characteristics of crab burrows in Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in the Yangtze Estuary and their influencing factors.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Crab burrows have a unique structure, which is essential for ecosystem functions and for the survival and reproduction of crabs in tidal salt marshes. Studies on the distribution characteristics of the burrows, and corresponding factors that influence such features, provide an important basis to reveal the ecosystem functions of crabs and their burrows. In October 2015, we conducted surveys on crab burrows in three typical salt marsh habitats in the northern tidal flat of Chongming Island; Phragmites australis habitat, Spartina alterniflora habitat, and P. australis - S. alterniflorg, mixed habitat. In each habitat, the characteristics of crab burrows and related factors, including macrobenthos, vegetation, and sediment, were surveyed. The results indicated that the type of the habitat influenced the crab burrow distributions and their related factors. Burrow densities and opening diameters were significantly different among the different habitats (P < 0.05). The burrow density in P. australis habitat was significantly higher than that in S. alterniflora habitat (P < 0.05), whereas the burrow opening diameter in S. alterniflora habitat was significantly greater than that in P. australis habitat (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in biomass, macrobenthos density, and belowground biomass of plants among the different habitats (P > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in shoot density, height, aboveground biomass of the vegetation, as well as water content, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential of the sediment among the different habitats (P < 0.05). The differences among the habitats in the total carbon content, total nitrogen content, and median particle diameter of the sediments varied with depth. The different combinations of habitat factors resulted in a variation in the distribution characteristics of crab burrows. In the present study, although the combination of several selected factors was significantly correlated with the crab burrow distribution characteristics, the coefficient was relatively low. Therefore, there could be other factors that were not included in the survey that also affected burrow distribution and characteristics. Further study should extend the scope of the factors and strengthen the comprehensive analysis.

TI  - Trace metal concentrations in coastal marshes of the Lower Parana River and the Rio de la Plata Estuary
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Fe in water, sediment and tissue of the emergent macrophyte Schoenoplectus californicus were studied in three coastal environments differing in aquatic chemistry and tide amplitude: a deltaic floodplain marsh, a coastal vegetated strip of the river and a tidal marsh at the south margin of the Rio de la Plata Estuary. Metal content in water was not significantly different between the river and the floodplain marsh. Metal content in sediments showed higher values in the marshes than in the river, suggesting a retention in the marsh. Except for Cu, the highest metal content in sediments and water was observed in the tidal marsh. Pb in plants was undetectable. Metal content was higher in rhizomes, except Cr, which was mainly stored in stems. Rhizome metal content was higher in the river, probably related to the higher redox potential of its sediments. Inflorescence metal content was higher in the marshes: the highest Zn, Cr and Fe contents were measured in the tidal marsh; the highest Cu content was in the floodplain marsh, together with the highest organic matter content of the sediments. Zn, Cr and Fe increased in standing drying stems and in inflorescences in late fall. Inflorescences showed the highest metal content after seeds had been released.

TI  - Zonation of ground beetles (Coleoptera : Carabidae) and spiders (Araneida) in salt marshes at the North and the Baltic Sea and the impact of the predicted sea level increase
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground beetles and spiders of two salt marshes at the German North and Baltic Sea coast were investigated by pitfall traps in 1997 and 1998. While the sites at the North Sea coast are tidal salt marshes, the salt marshes at the Baltic Sea are not influenced by tides. Pitfall traps were installed in a gradient from 20 to 150 cm above MHT (mean high tide: 157 cm + NN, NN: 500 cm above 0 at Amsterdam gauge) at the North Sea coast or NN at the Baltic Sea coast at six or seven sampling elevations, each with five replicates. Conductivity, water content, organic substance, frequency or duration of floodings, sand content and pH of the soil were determined. The flooding regime is the major factor controlling the zonation of invertebrates. Two and three invertebrate assemblages at the North and Baltic Sea, respectively, were distinguished. These corresponded well with the vegetational zones. The border between the two zones was at 60-80 cm above MHT at the North Sea. The three zones at the Baltic Sea extended between 20 and 30 cm, 40 to 80 cm and 100 to 150 cm above NN. The elevation of the mean abundance of species above MHT or NN was calculated. A tide simulation experiment resulted in a shifting population and in an increasing activity under a tidal regime as predicted for the global climate change conditions in 2050. From the actual elevation of the mean abundance, the habitat size of salt marsh species was calculated for a moderate and worse scenario of global climate change. Habitat reduction becomes highest for species of the lower salt marsh zone. Under worse conditions the gradiental length of habitat will only amount to a maximum of 20 m at the slopes of the dikes.

TI  - A Comparison between the MODIS Product (MOD17A2) and a Tide-Robust Empirical GPP Model Evaluated in a Georgia Wetland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of tidal ecosystems in the global carbon budget, the relationships between environmental drivers and carbon dynamics in these wetlands remain poorly understood. This limited understanding results from the challenges associated with in situ flux studies and their correlation with satellite imagery which can be affected by periodic tidal flooding. Carbon dioxide eddy covariance (EC) towers are installed in only a few wetlands worldwide, and the longest eddy-covariance record from Georgia (GA) wetlands contains only two continuous years of observations. The goals of the present study were to evaluate the performance of existing MODIS Gross Primary Production (GPP) products (MOD17A2) against EC derived GPP and develop a tide-robust Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) based model to predict GPP within a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh on Sapelo Island, GA. These EC tower-based observations represent a basis to associate CO2 fluxes with canopy reflectance and thus provide the means to use satellite-based reflectance data for broader scale investigations. We demonstrate that Light Use Efficiency (LUE)-based MOD17A2 does not accurately reflect tidal wetland GPP compared to a simple empirical vegetation index-based model where tidal influence was accounted for. The NDMI-based GPP model was capable of predicting changes in wetland CO2 fluxes and explained 46% of the variation in flux-estimated GPP within the training data, and a root mean square error of 6.96 g C m(-2) in the validation data. Our investigation is the first to create a MODIS-based wetland GPP estimation procedure that demonstrates the importance of filtering tidal observations from satellite surface reflectance data.

TI  - Effects of Various Interference Intensities on the Soil Bacterial Communities Diversity in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale agricultural land reclamation activities can trigger substantial changes in the soil bacterial community by disturbances associated with growth of crops and addition of fertilizers and pesticides. In this study, the bacterial 16S gene was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform for bacterial identification and taxonomy. We investigated the (i) soil bacterial diversity and community composition in natural marsh, moderate and severe intensity of interference in wetlands, and (ii) the relationship between soil physical and chemical properties, and soil bacterial community structures in order to understand the effects of interference intensities on the marsh soil environment in the Sanjiang Plain wetland, Northeast China. The natural marsh soil contained most of 573 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between all the three sites (n=1241), while wetland soils of moderate and severe intensity of interference had only 510 and 401 OTUs, respectively. The soil bacterial diversity and richness indices of all disturbed wetlands presented a decline at the OTU level, alpha diversity (Shannon diversity and Chao and Ace diversities). In addition, the composition of soil bacterial communities showed different trends and structure after the disturbance. There were significant variation in unclassified genera and some dominant genera (relative abundance>1% in at least one site) between natural marsh and difference in interference intensities in disturbed wetlands, including Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi and Gemmatimonadetes. Composition of soil bacterial community was affected by Soil Moisture, pH, Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Available Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Available Phosphorus, Total Potassium, Nitrate Nitrogen, Available Potassium and Ammonium Nitrogen. This study will provide a fundamental scope to understand the bacterial community structure in wetland ecosystems and the environmental function as a predictor of bacterial community composition.

TI  - Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or "blue carbon" systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

TI  - Export of Dissolved Organic Carbon from a Ponded Freshwater Marsh Receiving Diverted Mississippi River Water
T2  - THESCIENTIFICWORLDJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of diversion projects has been implemented to reintroduce Mississippi River water into Louisiana's coastal wetlands in order to reduce wetland loss. The export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured in a 3,700-ha ponded freshwater marsh that receives diverted Mississippi River water. Results show that highly organic marsh soil and plant material are a source of DOC. DOC, on average, was 3 mg/l greater in outlet water as compared to the concentration in river water entering the wetland. DOC in water leaving the marsh was higher in summer months, with a concentration up to 18 mg/l. Based on a discharge of 1,000 ft(3)/sec (28.3 m(3)/sec), it was estimated that the equivalent of 7,335 kg/day of DOC would be exported from the marsh into Lake Cataouatche, located in the northern portion of the Louisiana Barataria Basin estuary. Results suggest that river diversion would likely increase the export of DOC from the marsh as compared to normal transport associated with rainfall and tidal exchange.

T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline sulfidic soils are usually associated with tidal flushing zones. However, less developed saline sulfidic soils have recently been identified in non-tidal seepage and marsh areas strongly affected by waterlogging, dryland salinity and erosion in the Mediterranean climatic region (>600 mm per annum winter rainfall maximum) of the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia. A conceptual sub-model is developed to explain the formation of these saline sulfidic soils by using data from detailed pedological, mineralogical, hydrological and physico-chemical investigations.The following three saline sulfidic features were recognised both within the subsurface soil layers and on the soil surface: (i) black sulfidic materials, (ii) iron-rich gelatinous precipitates and (iii) salt-iron crusts. The abundance of these features and their distribution in relation to each other were used to establish a chronological order of formation. For each saline sulfidic feature, specific minerals (e.g. pyrite framboids, ferrihydrite and schwertmannite) were identified and their conditions of formation (e.g, Eh and pH) established. Their development is closely associated with two water-flow systems: a rising saline sulfatic groundwater aquifer and the seasonal discharge of fresh water via a perched water table, The conceptual sub-model shows how these two water-how systems and three biomineralization processes lead to the formation of these saline sulfidic marsh soils. It illustrates how the following three main conditions control the formation of these non-tidal saline sulfidic marsh soils: (i) the development of aquic and saline conditions throughout the solum, (ii) the accumulation of organic matter from which Fe and S reducing/oxidising bacteria derive their energy, and (iii) a continuous supply of Fe and S in groundwater aquifers. In the Mt Lofty Ranges, such conditions are due to rising saline sulfatic groundwater tables following land clearing since European settlement and contemporary weathering of pyrite lenses in the underlying rock.

TI  - Iron dynamics in a subtropical estuarine tidal marsh: effect of season and vegetation
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand how seasonal change and the presence of plants affect biogeochemical iron (Fe) cycling in tidal marsh sediments, we examined the seasonal dynamics of microbial Fe reduction (FeR) and related Fe speciation from 2012 to 2014 using in situ vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms created with macrobenthos-proof enclosures. The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge. Our study reveals that temperature and plants both mediate variations in the organic carbon mineralization pathways of a subtropical estuarine tidal marsh.

TI  - Tagus estuary and Ria de Aveiro salt marsh dynamics and the impact of sea level rise
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Different characteristics of Spartina maritima found in two distinct salt marshes located in different estuaries were analysed through interpretation of their local hydrodynamic patterns, as well as the impact of sea level rise on physical processes and consequently on plant dynamics and salt marshes stability. These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

TI  - The effect of Zostera noltii, Spartina maritima and Scirpus maritimus on sediment pore-water profiles in a temperate intertidal estuary
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 38th European Marine Biology Symposium
CL  - Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL
AB  - The objective of the present work was to study the effect of plants common in temperate latitudes (Zostera noltii, Spartina maritima and Scirpus maritimus) on sediment nutrient profiles, and to compare it to sand- and mud-flats without vegetation. The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.

TI  - Linear and nonlinear effects of temperature and precipitation on ecosystem properties in tidal saline wetlands
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate greatly influences the structure and functioning of tidal saline wetland ecosystems. However, there is a need to better quantify the effects of climatic drivers on ecosystem properties, particularly near climate-sensitive ecological transition zones. Here, we used climate- and literature-derived ecological data from tidal saline wetlands to test hypotheses regarding the influence of climatic drivers (i.e., temperature and precipitation regimes) on the following six ecosystem properties: canopy height, biomass, productivity, decomposition, soil carbon density, and soil carbon accumulation. Our analyses quantify and elucidate linear and nonlinear effects of climatic drivers. We quantified positive linear relationships between temperature and above-ground productivity and strong positive nonlinear (sigmoidal) relationships between (1) temperature and above-ground biomass and canopy height and (2) precipitation and canopy height. Near temperature-controlled mangrove range limits, small changes in temperature are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in biomass and canopy height, as mangrove forests grow, expand, and, in some cases, replace salt marshes. However, within these same transition zones, temperature-induced changes in productivity are expected to be comparatively small. Interestingly, despite the significant above-ground height, biomass, and productivity relationships across the tropical-temperate mangrove-marsh transition zone, the relationships between temperature and soil carbon density or soil carbon accumulation were not significant. Our literature review identifies several ecosystem properties and many regions of the world for which there are insufficient data to fully evaluate the influence of climatic drivers, and the identified data gaps can be used by scientists to guide future research. Our analyses indicate that near precipitation-controlled transition zones, small changes in precipitation are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in canopy height. However, there are scant data to evaluate the influence of precipitation on other ecosystem properties. There is a need for more decomposition data across climatic gradients, and to advance understanding of the influence of changes in precipitation and freshwater availability, additional ecological data are needed from tidal saline wetlands in arid climates. Collectively, our results can help scientists and managers better anticipate the linear and nonlinear ecological consequences of climate change for coastal wetlands.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon      (blue carbon), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid      regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions      where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their      tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these      unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks (above- and      belowground biomass and soil) in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates      in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial      mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats)      and were funded by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. Plant carbon for mature mangrove trees were measured following methodology      from Kauffman and Donato (2012). Due to their smaller structure, all trees      with stems > 3 cm diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.3 m in height)      within the 7 m plot were measured instead of restricting measurement to      trees with DBH > 10 cm. Standing dead trees and downed woody debris      were found at some Gulf of Oman sites and pools were quantified      appropriately (Kauffman and Donato 2012). In the planted mangrove sites,      five 2-m radius plots were established at 10-m intervals along a 40-m      transect. When stands contained individuals < 1.3 m tall, we      measured the crown diameter and main stem diameter at 30-50 cm in height.      In the 3, 5, and 10 year old planted mangrove sites in Abu al Abyad, trees      were planted in an evenly-spaced grid; therefore, the plant density was      calculated by measuring the average plant spacing and main stem and crown      diameter of 50-75 trees.Salt marsh transect length and plot spacing were      the same as with the mature mangroves, although the plot radius ranged      from 1-4 m depending on plant density. The height and elliptical crown      area (perpendicular crown widths centered on the canopy) were measured on      every plant rooted in each plot.Biomass for A. marina and A. macrostachyum      were calculated using allometric equations. Global tree carbon percentages      of 48 and 39% for above- and belowground biomass, respectively, were      applied (Kauffman and Donato 2012). To examine differences in average      annual carbon sequestered in planted mangrove trees, we divided total      biomass for each stand by the number of years since plantation      establishment. We developed allometric equations for A. macrostachyum      aboveground biomass, as none previously had been published. Twenty-four      plants were collected from three sites and measured for crown dimensions      and succulent woody tissue fresh weight. A subsample of each tissue type      from every plant was weighed fresh and dry (constant weight at 50°C) to      calculate a wet-to-dry mass conversion factor for the entire plant. Simple      linear regression of natural log-transformed oven-dry biomass and plant      volume (height x elliptical crown area) were calculated, producing two      different relationships depending on plant size. Tissue samples were      analyzed for percent carbon and nitrogen; carbon content of woody (n = 12)      and succulent (n = 10) tissue averaged 45.5 and 34.0%, respectively (SE       0.7% for both). We used the proportion of 52% woody tissue reported in      Neves et al. (2010) to calculate carbon content for aboveground biomass as      40.3  1.4%C. The reported root to shoot ratio of A. macrostachyum      measured in Portugal (Neves et al. 2010) is likely a conservative estimate      of root biomass, as soil cores were taken to a depth of 15 cm instead of      20-30 cm as in other studies (reviewed in Curco et al. 2002).Soil Carbon      PoolsAt mangrove and salt marsh plots, undisturbed soil samples were      collected following methodology from Kauffman and Donato (2012) using a 1      m-long gouge auger with an open-face, semi-cylindrical chamber of 5.1 cm      radius. Soils were cored to 3 m or until coarse marine sands or coral      rubble representing the parent material was encountered. The soil core was      divided into depth intervals of 0-15, 15-30, 30-50, 50-100, and      >100 cm, or until refusal. Subsamples collected from center of each      interval were analyzed for bulk density (dry mass per unit volume) and      carbon concentration (organic and inorganic). If encountered, unique soil      layers were sampled separately. The same soil sampling methodology was      used within microbial mats and coastal sabkha; the number of plots sampled      per transect varied from 3-6 plots spaced at 20 m intervals along a      transect. We determined soil carbon stocks following methods outlined in      Fourqurean et al. (2012a), which are designed to account for soils      containing carbonates. A variety of soil biogeochemical measurements, soil      respiration, elevation, and tidal data were collected in selected      mangroves, salt marsh, microbial mats, and sabkha sampled in 2013;      mangroves sampled in 2014 were not sampled. Redox potential (Eh) was      estimated from five replicate platinum-tipped electrodes inserted 10 cm      into the soil for a period of 1-20 minutes and corrected for the potential      of the calomel reference electrode by adding 244 mV (Megonigal and      Rabenhorst 2013). At sites that had a shallow water table, soil pore-water      was collected from corer boreholes at 5-10 cm below the surface and      analyzed by the standard methods described in Keller et al. (2009).      Salinity was determined either by refractometer (values < 160) or      calculated from [Cl-] (values > 160). pH was measured in the field      with a portable electrode. Porewater dissolved methane (CH4) was measured      by headspace equilibration following Keller et al. (2009) and stored in      evacuated Exetainer vials until analysis by Varian 450-GC gas      chromatography. Porewater [SO42-] and [Cl-] were determined by Dionex      ICS-2000 ion chromatography on filter-sterilized (0.22 m), HCl-acidified      samples, and the sulfate depletion ratio was calculated per Keller et al.      (2009). Gas and filtered porewater samples were stored for four weeks      before analysis, which is well within the capacity of the storage methods      used. We quantified instantaneous CO2 gas exchange rates as a simple index      of activity to assist with comparisons across the ecosystems in this      study. Soil surface CO2 emissions were measured with a LICOR 6400 soil      respiration analyzer, with a range of 2-18 measurements per site,      depending on time spent at each site and the rate of soil respiration;      more measurements were possible at higher respiration rates.

TI  - Variations in carbon burial and sediment accretion along a tidal creek in a Florida salt marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes store large quantities of carbon in the form of buried organic matter (OM) and consequently play a major role in the global carbon cycle, yet vertical accretion and carbon burial rates (CBRs) can vary by orders of magnitude on small spatial scales. The goal of this study was to provide insight into carbon burial variability of a single tidal salt marsh. Six marsh sediment cores were collected along a tidal creek in the Big Bend of Florida from the mouth to the coastal forest within the marsh levee and plain. Each was analyzed for porosity, % OM, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C-13, N-15, and excess Pb-210 to determine vertical accretion and CBRs. Porosity, % OM, and TOC and TN were found to be highest in the low marsh and within the marsh levee. Stable isotopes of OM indicate the source is dominated by C3 plant species in both the levee and plain. Average vertical accretion ranges from 0.9 mm yr(-1) to 2.2 mm yr(-1) with the slowest rates in the low marsh. Average carbon burial ranges from 49.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1) to 109.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). High carbon burial associated with low sediment accumulation in the Low Marsh and low carbon burial associated with high sediment accumulation rates in the High Marsh are typical in this marsh. These variations imply that the highest carbon burial occurs in the zone most vulnerable to loss via inundation and erosion.

TI  - An acid sulfate perspective on landscape/seascape soil mineralogy in the US Mid-Atlantic region
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - A conceptual framework is presented to portray how Fe, S and other elements (Ca, Si, K) are geologically and pedologically cycled between minerals that are formed and are stable in land-based aerobic environments and those that are formed and are stable in anaerobic sea-based environments. Foremost among the elements discussed are Fe and S, which cycle between Fe sulfides, formed by sulfidization in the anaerobic sea-based environments of tidal marsh and subaqueous soils and sediments, and Fe oxides and jarosite, formed by sulfuricization in upland soils upon the exposure of the sulfide-mineral bearing sediments to oxidizing conditions. Some results of previously conducted experiments are presented to demonstrate that Fe oxides placed in the sea-based anaerobic tidal marsh and subaqueous soils are rapidly transformed to Fe sulfides - apparently by the reduction of Fe3+ by sulfide of H2S, generated from sulfate of sea water with the oxidized form of S serving as the electron acceptor during the oxidation of organic matter. Documentation of rapid sulfuricization of sulfidic materials to form sulfuric horizons upon exposure to aerobic conditions is also presented. Ca from sea water, biologically precipitated as calcite and aragonite in shells of organisms that thrive in brackish sea-influenced environments is sometimes transformed temporarily, before dissolution and leaching of the Ca and sulfate, into gypsum by sulfuricization in uplands when the shells are present in exposed sulfidic materials. Silica is also released from silicate minerals during sulfuricization, which can reprecipitate as opal-CT, to cause cementation of soil materials into duripan-like formations. In the geologic past, opal (in the form of diatoms) and glauconite formed in Tertiary-age geologic sediments under marine conditions, to become part of the parent materials for upland active and post-active acid sulfate soils of the present time. Modern formation of glauconite in subaqueous soils and shallow sediments has not been found, but the topic needs further investigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of sewage sludge on the growth of potted salt marsh plants exposed to natural tidal inundation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A growth experiment with native plants in pots exposed to natural environmental conditions evaluates the use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in restoration of a southern California salt marsh. Sludge containing desirable organic matter but also undesirable heavy metal contaminants was mixed with a readily available matrix soil to reduce metal concentrations to levels below legal limits for land applications of sludge. Soil nutrient analysis revealed expected increases in total nitrogen and total phosphorus content with increasing sludge concentration. Soil metals analysis, however, revealed decreases in metal content with increased sludge concentration, a trend evidently caused by higher than expected metal content in the matrix soil. Five artificial soil mixtures ranging from 0 to 70% sludge were accompanied by natural wetland soil controls. Pots containing these soils were placed into a natural salt marsh. The pots were then planted with two native salt marsh plant species, Salicornia virginica and Frankenia grandifolia . Aboveground biomass was harvested after 12 months. Plant growth displayed no obvious change with increasing sludge concentration. Over the concentration ranges used, increased nutrient content did not stimulate plant growth and increased metal content did not inhibit plant growth. Plants grew better in natural wetland soil than in artificial soil mixtures, a trend probably caused by the substantially finer texture and higher organic content of natural soil. All sludge treatments differed more from the natural soil than from each other, implying that within the ranges examined, soil texture and organic content exerted more influence on plant growth than did metal or nutrient concentration. These results suggest that incorporating this sewage sludge in the soil of the restored salt marsh will neither benefit nor harm the plants that will live there and that greatest plant growth will be achieved by mixing the sludge with a fine-grained matrix soil.

TI  - Application of sequential extractions and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the speciation of chromium in Northern New Jersey marsh soils developed in chromite ore processing residue (COPR)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cr speciation in marsh soils developed in weathering chromite ore processing residue (COPR) was characterized using sequential extractions and synchrotron microbeam and bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) analyses. The sequential extractions suggested substantial Cr associated with reducible and oxidizable soil components, and significant non-extractable residual Cr. Notable differences in Cr speciation estimates from three extraction schemes underscore the operationally defined nature of Cr speciation provided by these methods. Micro X-ray fluorescence maps and mu-XAS data indicated the presence of mu m-sized chromite particles scattered throughout the weathered COPR matrix. These particles derive from the original COPR material, and have relatively high resistance towards weathering. and therefore persist even after prolonged leaching. Bulk XAS data further indicated Cr(III) incorporated in Fe(OH)(3), and Cr(III) associated with organic matter. The low Cr contents of the weathered material (200-850 ppm) compared to unweathered COPR (20,000-60,000 ppm) point to substantial Cr leaching during COPR weathering, with partial repartitioning of released Cr into secondary Fe(OH)(3) phases and organics. The effects of anoxia on Cr speciation, and the potential of active COPR weathering releasing Cr(VI) deeper in the profile require further study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transient coastal landscapes: Rising sea level threatens salt marshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are important coastal environments that provide key ecological services. As sea level rise has accelerated globally, concerns about the ability of salt marshes to survive submergence are increasing. Previous estimates of likely survival of salt marshes were based on ratios of sea level rise to marsh platform accretion. Here we took advantage of an unusual, long-term(1979-2015), spatially detailed comparison of changes in a representative New England salt marsh to provide an empirical estimate of habitat losses based on actual measurements. We show prominent changes in habitat mosaic within the marsh, consistent and coincident with increased submergence and coastal erosion. Model results suggest that at current rates of sea level rise, marsh platform accretion, habitat loss, and with the limitation of the widespread "coastal squeeze", the entire ecosystem might disappear by the beginning of the next century, a fate that might be likely for many salt marshes elsewhere. Meta-analysis of available data suggests that 40 to 95% of the world's salt marshes will be submerged, depending on whether sea level rise remains at current or reaches anticipated rates for the end of this century.

TI  - Sea-level rise thresholds for stability of salt marshes in a riverine versus a marine dominated estuary
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the ecological resilience of salt marshes by deriving sea level rise (SLR) thresholds in two estuaries with contrasting upland hydrological inputs in the north-central Gulf of Mexico: Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) with limited upland input, and the Pascagoula River delta drained by the Pascagoula River, the largest unclaimed river in the continental United States. We applied a mechanistic model to account for vegetation responses and hydrodynamics to predict salt marsh distributions under future SLR scenarios. We further investigated the potential mechanisms that contribute to salt marsh resilience to SLR.The modeling results show that salt marshes in the riverine dominated estuary are more resilient to SLR than in the marine dominated estuary with SLR thresholds of 10.3 mm/yr and 7.2 mm/yr respectively. This difference of >3 m m/yr is mainly contributed by larger quantities of riverine-borne mineral sediments in the Pascagoula River. In both systems, sediment trapping by the above-ground vegetation appears to contribute more to marsh platform accretion than organic matter from below-ground biomass based on the medians of the accretion rates. However, below-ground biomass could contribute up to 90% of accretion in the marine dominated estuary compared to only 60% of accretion in the riverine dominated estuary. SLR thresholds of salt marshes are more sensitive to vegetation biomass in the marine dominated estuary while biomass and sediment similarly affect SLR thresholds of salt marshes in the riverine dominated estuary.This research will likely help facilitate more informed decisions on conservation/restoration policies for these two types of systems in the near-term needed to minimize future catastrophic loss of these coastal marsh habitats once SLR thresholds are exceeded.

TI  - Climatic temperature controls the geographical patterns of coastal marshes greenhouse gases emissions over China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes contribute greatly to atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) and have thus attracted considerable attention at regional and global scales. However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.

TI  - Response of salt-marsh carbon accumulation to climate change
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - About half of annual marine carbon burial takes place in shallow water ecosystems where geomorphic and ecological stability is driven by interactions between the flow of water, vegetation growth and sediment transport(1). Although the sensitivity of terrestrial and deep marine carbon pools to climate change has been studied for decades, there is little understanding of how coastal carbon accumulation rates will change and potentially feed back on climate(2,3). Here we develop a numerical model of salt marsh evolution, informed by recent measurements of productivity and decomposition, and demonstrate that competition between mineral sediment deposition and organic-matter accumulation determines the net impact of climate change on carbon accumulation in intertidal wetlands. We find that the direct impact of warming on soil carbon accumulation rates is more subtle than the impact of warming-driven sea level rise, although the impact of warming increases with increasing rates of sea level rise. Our simulations suggest that the net impact of climate change will be to increase carbon burial rates in the first half of the twenty-first century, but that carbon-climate feedbacks are likely to diminish over time.

TI  - Bromine enrichment in marsh sediments as a marker of environmental changes driven by Grand Solar Minima and anthropogenic activity (Caminha, NW of Portugal)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

TI  - EFFECT OF EDAPHIC FACTORS ON THE VEGETATION ZONATION IN SOME LITTORAL AND INLAND SALT MARSHES OF EGYPT
T2  - Botanica
M3  - Article
AB  - The segregation of a few dominant plant species into distinctive zones is characteristic of salt marshes. Vegetation zonation was investigated in the littoral salt marshes (South Marsa Alam region) and the inland salt marshes (Wadi El-Natrun region) of Egypt. Twenty taxa belonging to 18 genera and 11 families were recorded and classified into two sets at the two studied sites and subdivided into four groups by TWINSPAN, according to a relevance value: group A) co-dominated by Juncus acutus and Juncus rigidus; B) - dominated by Aeluropus lagopoides; C, D) - Limonium axillare. The analysis of species diversity in the inland salt marshes as well as the Shannon and the Simpson indices showed the highest species richness compared to that in the littoral salt marshes. The soil of the inland salt marshes was characterized by high percentages of silt, clay, also the soluble anion SO4-2 was the highest. While the most effective factor in the littoral salt marshes was EC, sand fractions, moisture content, soluble cations as Na+, Ca+2, soluble anions as Cl, organic matter and CaCO3. The proximity matrix between the two types of salt marshes indicated that they were different, except for the stands of Juncus rigidus, the elucidation distance was the smallest and they were similar together.

TI  - Metal(oid) mobility in a hypersaline salt marsh sediment (Secovlje Salina, northern Adriatic, Slovenia)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, sediments from the Secovlje Salina (northern Adriatic, Slovenia) were geochemically investigated in order to decode the mobility of metal(oid)s in the hypersaline environment. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn were comparable to those detected in various similar coastal background areas, as well as in the Secovlje salt marsh core sample. The estimated mobility potential of metal(oid)s in sediment decreases in the following order: Mo > As > Cu > Sb > Sn > Co > Pb > Ni > Zn. Since the hypersaline sediment (e.g. healing mud) is used as a healing factor (it can be applied directly on human skin), the study of metal(oid) bioavailability in an interaction between the hypersaline sediments and the artificial sweat was also performed. It is significant that the metal(oid) contents are leached in very low concentrations and are treated as nontoxic for humans according to international norms for cosmetic products. The study provides information in order to assess the role of metal mobility on the potential health impact of the application of natural healing mud. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tidal marshes as energy sources for commercially important nektonic organisms: stable isotope analysis
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes provide nursery habitats for many commercial nektonic species; thus, determining trophic linkages between tidal marshes and aquatic consumers is important for sustaining fishery production in estuarine ecosystems. We examined stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in 4 commercial nekton species (Chelon haematocheilus, Synechogobius ommaturus, Lateolabrax maculatus and Exopalaemon carinicauda) in the tidal marshes of the Yangtze River estuary, China. We estimated the frequency and range of potential contribution (0 to 100%) from different food sources (benthic microalgae, suspended particulate organic matter, the invasive C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora and native C-3 plants Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) to the nektonic consumers, and then pooled the contributions for primary producers with similar isotope values (giving 3 groups: microalgae, invasive C-4 plant and native C-3 plants). Marsh vascular plants and microalgae were at the base of the food web supporting these nektonic species. For C. haematocheilus and S. ommaturus, vascular plants constituted a larger fraction of their carbon source than microalgae. S. alterniflora contributed more than 50% of their total organic carbon and was more important than the native C-3 plants. For L. maculatus and E. carinicauda, intermediate delta C-13 values precluded definitive assignment of a major carbon source. We have shown that tidal marshes provide important food sources for some dominant estuarine nektonic species, and that the exotic plant S. alterniflora has been incorporated into aquatic food webs of the Yangtze River estuary.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in a Pacific Northwest Eelgrass (Zostera marina) Meadow
T2  - NORTHWEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are known to be efficient carbon sinks due to high rates of primary productivity, carbon burial by mineral sediments, and low rates of sediment organic matter decomposition. Of the three coastal wetland types: tidal marshes, tidal forests, and seagrass meadows, carbon burial by seagrasses is relatively under-studied, and reported rates range widely from 45 to 190 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additionally, most of these seagrass rates are biased toward tropical and subtropical species, particularly Posidonia oceanica, with few focused on Zostera marina, the most widespread species in the northern hemisphere. We measured sediment organic content, carbon content, and long-term accretion rates to estimate organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates for a Z. marina meadow in Padilla Bay, a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Washington. We found rates of carbon sequestration to be quite low relative to commonly reported values, averaging 9 to 11 g C m(-2) yr(-1). We attribute this to both low sediment organic content and low rates of accretion. We postulate here that Padilla Bay's low carbon sequestration capacity may be representative of healthy Z. marina meadows rather than an anomaly, and that Z. marina meadows have an inherently low carbon sequestration capacity because of the species' low tolerance for suspended sediment (which limits light availability) and sediment organic content (which leads to toxic sulfide levels). Further research should focus on measuring carbon sequestration rates from other Z. marina meadows, particularly from sites that exhibit, a priori, the potential for higher rates of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Population Dynamics and Community Composition of Ammonia Oxidizers in Salt Marshes after the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico had significant effects on microbial communities in the Gulf, but impacts on nitrifying communities in adjacent salt marshes have not been investigated. We studied persistent effects of oil on ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities and their relationship to nitrification rates and soil properties in Louisiana marshes impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Soils were collected at oiled and unoiled sites from Louisiana coastal marshes in July 2012, 2 years after the spill, and analyzed for community differences based on ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA). Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses revealed significantly different AOA and AOB communities between the three regions, but few differences were found between oiled and unoiled sites. Community composition of nitrifiers was best explained by differences in soil moisture and nitrogen content. Despite the lack of significant oil effects on overall community composition, we identified differences in correlations of individual populations with potential nitrification rates between oiled and unoiled sites that help explain previously published correlation patterns. Our results suggest that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, led to subtle changes in population dynamics. How, or if, these changes may impact ecosystem function in the marshes, however, remains uncertain.

TI  - Characteristics of greenhouse gas emission in the Yellow River Delta wetland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta wetland is the most integrated, broadest, youngest wetland ecological system in China. Due to the affection by human activities, the wetland is under a degraded risk and urgently require for ecological restoration. Moreover, the wetland is an influenced and responsive region of global change because of its unique water-heat effect and greenhouse gas metabolic process. In this study, five typical salt marsh plant communities were selected to study the characteristics of greenhouse gas emission of the wetland. The results indicated that the greenhouse gas emission, especially for the CO2 and CH4, showed a distinctly spatial variation. The sample site (HW4) discharged the maximum emissions concentration of CH4 and CO2, reaching 691.6 and 1.32 mg/m(3) in the static opaque chamber, respectively. The total annual emissions of CH4 and CO2 were approximately 1.20 x 10(4) t a(-1) and 18.4 x 10(4) t a(-1) in the five plant communities. It was also found that the relationship of the soil moisture to CH4 emissions was positive correlation, but that to CO2 emissions was negative correlation. In addition, there was a linear correlation (y = 0.0196x + 0.0252, R-2 = 0.9872) between the content of Fe and Mn in the soil. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Testate amoebae as estuarine water-level indicators: modern distribution and the development of a transfer function from a freshwater tidal marsh (Scheldt estuary, Belgium)
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the century-scale response of water levels in inland estuaries to sea-level change and human modifications to estuarine morphology. This study explored the ability of using testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) from sediments of a freshwater tidal marsh as indicators of water level in an inland estuary. The hypothesis was that modern testate amoeba assemblages change with surface elevation (approximately the duration of tidal flooding) within a freshwater tidal marsh. Variation in testate amoeba assemblages in relation to multiple environmental variables and sediment characteristics was studied through redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that a significant part of the variation in modern testate amoeba assemblages could be explained by flooding frequency, surface elevation, organic content and particle size of the soil. Transfer functions, partial least squares and weighted average regressions were made to show that testate amoebae can be used for reconstruction of water level (with an accuracy of 0.05 Normalized Elevation). A preliminary test of application of the transfer function to palaeo testate amoeba assemblages showed promising results. Testate amoebae from a freshwater tidal marsh provide a potentially powerful new tool for estuarine water-level reconstructions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Sea-level rise will reduce net CO2 uptake in subtropical coastal marshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes have a significant capacity to sequester carbon; however, sea-level rise (SLR) is expected to result in prolonged flooding and saltwater intrusion in coastal regions. To explore the effects of SLR projections on net CO2 uptake in coastal marshes, we conducted a "double-check" investigation, including the eddy covariance (EC) measurements of the CO2 fluxes in subtropical coastal marshes along inundation and salinity gradients, in combination with a mesocosm experiment for analyzing CO2 flux components under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. During the same measurement periods, the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEEEC based on the EC dataset) in an oligohaline marsh was higher than that in a low-elevation mesohaline marsh, whereas the NEEEC was lower than that in a high-elevation freshwater marsh. The declines in NEEEC between the marshes could be attributed to a greater decrease in gross primary production relative to ecosystem respiration. Waterlogging slightly increased the NEEms (NEE based on the mesocosms) because of inhibited soil respiration and slight changes in plant photosynthesis and shoot respiration. However, the NEEms measured during the drainage period decreased significantly due to the stimulated soil respiration. The NEEms decreased with increasing salinity (except under mild salinity), and waterlogging exacerbated the adverse impacts of salinity. The amplificatory effect of decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and growth under hydrological stresses contributed more to reduce the NEEms than to respiratory effluxes. Both water logging and increased salinity reduced the root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and activities of assayed soil enzymes (except for cellulase under waterlogging conditions), leading to limited soil respiration. The declines in plant growth, photosynthesis, and soil respiration could also be attributed to the decrease in soil nutrients under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. We propose that the coupling of SLR-driven hydrological effects lowers the capacity of CO2 uptake in subtropical coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil engineering ants increase CO2 and N2O emissions by affecting mound soil physicochemical characteristics from a marsh soil: A laboratory study
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As ecosystem engineers, ants can mediate soil processes and functions by producing biogenic structures. In their mounds, ants not only directly produce CO2 by respiration, but may also indirectly impact soil greenhouse gas emissions by affecting substrate availability and soil physicochemical characteristics. Recent studies focused on overall gas production from ant mounds. However, little is known about mound material respiration and N2O emissions in ant mounds in wetlands. We measured CO2 and N2O emissions from mound soils of three different ant species (Lasius niger Linnaeus, Lasius flavus Fabricius, and Formica candida Smith) and natural marsh soils in a laboratory incubation experiment. On the whole, average soil CO2 and N2O emission rates from ant mounds were significantly higher than from the natural marsh soils. Over the 64 days incubation, the cumulative soil CO2 and N2O production from ant mounds was, respectively, 1.5-3.0 and 1.9-50.2 times higher than from the natural soils. Soil gas emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by the specific ant species, with soil CO2 and N2O emissions from L. niger mounds being higher than those from F. candida or L. flavus mound soils. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions from ant mound soils were positively correlated with soil clay, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and NH4+ content. Our laboratory results indicated that mound soil is an important source of CO2 and N2O emission from ant mounds in marshes, making mounds potential "hot spots" for CO2 and N2O emissions. Ants may increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil gas emissions by changing mound soil physicochemical properties, especially carbon and nutrition content, and soil texture. Contributions from ant mound materials should be considered when describing soil C and N cycles and their driving factors in wetland ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollutant metals (Cu, Ph, Zn and Cd) in Late Flandrian mudflat/saltmarsh sediments in the Severn Estuary are predominantly bound in the carbonate, Fe/Mn oxide and organic phases. Comparison of the oxic Rumney Formation with the suboxic Wentlooge Formation shows that redox conditions control iron cycling, and that this in turn controls trace metal associations. An important fraction of the trace metals present in the Fe/Mn oxide phase in oxic sediments (such as the Rumney Formation) is remobilised during iron reduction and reprecipitated in other phases such as authigenic carbonates (as in the Wentlooge). Since many metal pollutants are highly redox sensitive, a better understanding of the effects of redox on metal speciation in estuarine sediments is useful for management of the coastal environment.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora and invasive Phragmites australis stands have similar greenhouse gas emissions in a New England marsh
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are critically important for a range of ecosystem services including nutrient filtration and carbon sequestration. Despite this, salt marshes are subjected to a variety of anthropogenic impacts, many with negative consequences. One impact is the introduction and subsequent proliferation of invasive species. An exotic strain of Phragmites australis has invaded salt marshes on the U.S. East Coast, affecting biodiversity, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. We quantified the difference between P. australis and native S. alterniflora in greenhouse gas emissions, net primary productivity, and biogeochemical parameters in sediment and porewater. Although we observed differences between the species (P. australis had greater biomass, drier and cooler sediments, and lower porewater nutrient concentrations), we obserVed no differences in greenhouse gas emissions. Vegetated and unvegetated plots had similar fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but very different fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to photosynthesis. Fluxes of the three gases examined were related to sediment temperature and live biomass. In addition, CH4 fluxes were linked to salinity while N2O fluxes were linked to photosynthetically active radiation. CO2 fluxes varied as expected over the seasons. Rates of CH4 production were generally low and typical of salt marshes, but showed a wide variation demonstrating the high spatial heterogeneity of CH4 production. The marsh in this study was not a significant sink or source of N2O, although small fluxes of N2O were detected on occasion. This study confirms that salt marshes with relatively low nitrogen impacts are not important contributors of N2O to the atmosphere. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial variations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur in the salt marsh sediments of the Yangtze Estuary in China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The EUROpean SAlt marshes Modelling (EUROSAM) project is part of the Thematic Network European Land-Ocean Interaction Studies programme. The main aims of the EUROSAM project were to fill in some of the main gaps in the understanding of ecological processes, to integrate this knowledge into models to predict the likely response of salt marsh ecosystems to environmental changes, and to make the knowledge available to decision-makers. Research work and model development for the project were carried out by researchers in France, Portugal, the Netherlands, and England, and included studies on sediment dynamics and interactions with vegetation, plant population dynamics and genetics, models of organic matter production and cycling, studies of animal communities, food webs and organic matter fluxes, and development of hydrodynamic models at different scales: salt marsh, bay, and estuary.This paper describes the main aims and outputs of the EUROSAM project, and the incorporation of the findings and models into a prototype Decision Support System (DSS). The EUROSAM DSS is designed as a guide for the nonspecialist to understand the important role and functioning of salt marshes, and for use as a management tool. Example scenarios were selected from the work within the project to illustrate the interactions between components of the salt marsh-mudflat ecosystem, and the potential impact of human activities and environmental change on the salt marsh system.

TI  - Soils and sediments of coastal ecology: A global carbon sink
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global extent of coasts is huge and it has a massive impact on the planetary C balance. Coasts are again very heterogeneous with their soils and sediments possessing varying C storing capacity. In this review, we tried to capture such capacity of soils and sediments of coastal natural ecologies (like estuary, mangrove, mudflat, tidal marsh, seagrass, lagoon, continental shelf etc.) and croplands collectively in a mechanistic way. A detail discussion highlights very high C accrual in coastal soils and sediments due to terrigenous C deposition, tidal sedimentation and presence of fine clay particles. Very high biomass of coastal mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass beds also results huge C burial in soils and sediments (blue C). Further, salinity and waterlogging induced low microbial activities, high soil aggregation and occlusion of C within aggregates impart prolonged residence time to C in coastal soils. All these confirm coastal ecology as a global C hotspot. However, climate change associated events like sea-level rise, ocean temperature increase, ocean acidification as well as human interferences have already affected the coasts and projected trend indicates severe possible damage of the coastal blue C in near future. Holistic sustainable measures will be required from different ends like government, local as well as international organizations to protect and restore the coastal C sink.

TI  - Large Natural pH, CO2 and O-2 Fluctuations in a Temperate Tidal Salt Marsh on Diel, Seasonal, and Interannual Time Scales
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marine organisms experience dynamic pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in their natural habitats, which may impact their susceptibility to long-term anthropogenic changes. Robust characterizations of all temporal scales of natural pH and DO fluctuations in different marine habitats are needed; however, appropriate time series of pH and DO are still scarce. We used multiyear (2008-2012), high-frequency (6 min) monitoring data to quantify diel, seasonal, and interannual scales of pH and DO variability in a productive, temperate tidal salt marsh (Flax Pond, Long Island, US). pH(NBS) and DO showed strong and similar seasonal patterns, with average (minimum) conditions declining from 8.2 (8.1) and 12.5 (11.4) mg l(-1) at the end of winter to 7.6 (7.2) and 6.3 (2.8) mg l(-1) in late summer, respectively. Concomitantly, average diel fluctuations increased from 0.22 and 2.2mg l(-1) (February) to 0.74 and 6.5 mg l(-1) (August), respectively. Diel patterns were modulated by tides and time of day, eliciting the most extreme minima when low tides aligned with the end of the night. Simultaneous in situ pCO(2) measurements showed striking fluctuations between similar to 330 and similar to 1,200 (early May), similar to 2,200 (mid June), and similar to 4,000 mu atm (end of July) within single tidal cycles. These patterns also indicate that the marsh's strong net heterotrophy influences its adjacent estuary by 'outwelling' acidified the coupled and fluctuating nature of pH and DO conditions in productive coastal and estuarine environments, which have yet to be adequately represented by experiments.

TI  - 'Blue Carbon' and Nutrient Stocks of Salt Marshes at a Temperate Coastal Lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal coastal lagoon with one of the largest continuous salt marshes in Europe. The objective of this work was to assess C, N and P stocks of Spartina maritima (low marsh pioneer halophyte) and Juncus maritimus (representative of mid-high marsh halophytes) combined with the contribution of Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia perennis, and Bolbochenous maritimus to the lagoon approximate to 4400 ha marsh area. A multivariate analysis (PCO), taking into account environmental variables and the annual biomass and nutrient dynamics, showed that there are no clear seasonal or spatial differences within low or mid-high marshes, but clearly separates J. maritimus and S. maritima marshes. Calculations of C, N and P stocks in the biomass of the five most representative halophytes plus the respective rhizosediment (25 cm depth), and taking into account their relative coverage, represents 252053 Mg C, 38100 Mg N and 7563 Mg P. Over 90% of the stocks are found within mid-high marshes. This work shows the importance of this lagoon's salt marshes on climate and nutrients regulation, and defines the current condition concerning the 'blue carbon' and nutrient stocks, as a basis for prospective future scenarios of salt marsh degradation or loss, namely under SLR context.

TI  - DEGRADATION OF METHYL-BROMIDE IN ANAEROBIC SEDIMENTS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl bromide (MeBr) was anaerobically degraded in saltmarsh sediments after reaction with sulfide. The product of this nucleophilic substitution reaction was methanethiol, which underwent further chemical and bacterial reactions to form dimethyl sulfide. These two gases appeared transiently during sediment incubations because they were metabolized by methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria. A second, less significant reaction of MeBr was the exchange with chloride, forming methyl chloride, which was also susceptible to attack by sulfide. Incubation of C-14-labeled methyl iodide as an analogue of MeBr resulted in the formation of (CH4)-C-14 and (CO2)-C-14 and also indicated that sulfate-reducing bacteria as well as methanogens metabolized the methylated sulfur intermediates. These results suggest that exposed sediments with abundant free sulfide, such as coastal salt-marshes, may constitute a sink for atmospheric MeBr.

TI  - Fingerprinting Blue Carbon: Rationale and Tools to Determine the Source of Organic Carbon in Marine Depositional Environments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.

TI  - Limited Vegetation Development on a Created Salt Marsh Associated with Over-Consolidated Sediments and Lack of Topographic Heterogeneity
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restored salt marshes frequently lack the full range of plant communities present on reference marshes, with upper marsh species underrepresented. This often results from sites being too low in the tidal frame and/or poorly drained with anoxic sediments. A managed coastal realignment scheme at Abbotts Hall, Essex, UK, has oxic sediments at elevations at which upper marsh communities would be expected. But 7 years after flooding, it continued to be dominated by pioneer communities, with substantial proportions of bare ground, so other factors must hinder vegetation development at these elevations. The poorly vegetated areas had high sediment shear strength, low water and organic carbon content and very flat topography. These characteristics occur frequently on the upper parts of created marshes. Experimental work is required to establish causal links with the ecological differences, but other studies have also reported that reduced plant beta-diversity and lower usage by fish are associated with topographic uniformity. Uniformity also leads to very different visual appearance from natural marshes. On the upper intertidal, sediment deposition rate are slow, water velocities are low and erosive forces are weak. So, topographic heterogeneity cannot develop naturally, even if creeks have been excavated. Without active management, these conditions will persist indefinitely.

TI  - Macrophytes and crabs affect nitrogen transformations in salt marshes of the Yangtze River Estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycling is important in determining ecosystem primary productivity and the succession of plant communities in coastal marshes. In order to examine the effects of biotic disturbances (i.e. vegetation change and crab burrowing) on N transformations, we conducted a field experiment in which crabs were either removed or left intact in three marsh types (bare flat, Phragmites australis marsh and Spartina alterniflora marsh) at Chongming Dongtan in the Yangtze River Estuary. The potential rates of soil gross nitrogen mineralization (GNM), gross ammonium immobilization (GAI), gross nitrification and gross nitrate consumption were determined using an ex situ incubation approach. Gross N mineralization was significantly lower in vegetated marshes than in the bare flat, probably because dissolved organic carbon (the main energy source for microbes) was lower in vegetated marshes. Less dissolved organic carbon in vegetated marshes may be attributable to high microbial demand for labile carbon relative to the supply of labile carbon in the rhizosphere. The presence of crabs increased the GAI:GNM ratio, indicating that crabs may increase the soil microbial demand for ammonium. Ammonium immobilization competed with nitrification for ammonium, and limited nitrification in crab-present plots. Furthermore, the lower nitrate production by nitrifies in crab-present plots resulted in lower rates of nitrate consumption. These results highlight the role of labile carbon and N in mediating the effects of macrophyte and soil fauna on N transformations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and have been identified as sources of uncertainty in the global carbon budget. Here we introduce a recently established mesonet of eddy covariance towers in South Carolina and describe the sensor arrays and data workflow used to produce three site-years of flux observations in coastal ecosystems. The tower sites represent tidal salt marsh (US-HB1), mature longleaf pine forest (US-HB2), and longleaf pine restoration (replanted clearcut; US-HB3). Coastal ecosystems remain less represented in climate studies despite their potential to sequester large amounts of carbon. Our goal in publishing this open access dataset is to contribute observations in understudied coastal ecosystems to facilitate synthesis and modeling analyses that advance carbon cycle science.Data Set:https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1660341 (US-HB1)https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1660342 (US-HB2)https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1660343 (US-HB3)Data Set License: AmeriFlux Data Use Policy; CC-BY-4.0

CL  - NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA
AB  - A growing number of studies have assessed the functional equivalency of restored and natural salt marshes. Several of these have explored the use of functional trajectories to track the increase in restored marsh function over time; however, these studies have disagreed as to the usefulness of such models in long-term predictions of restored marsh development. We compared indicators of four marsh functions (primary production, soil organic matter accumulation, sediment trapping, and maintenance of plant communities) in 6 restored and 11 reference (matched to restored marshes using principal components analysis) salt marshes in the Great Bay Estuary. The restored marshes were all constructed and planted on imported substrate and ranged in age from 1 to 14 years. We used marsh age in a space-for-time substitution to track constructed salt marsh development and explore the use of trajectories. A high degree of variability was observed among natural salt marsh sites, displaying the importance of carefully chosen reference sites. As expected, mean values for constructed site (n = 6) and reference site (n = 11) functions were significantly different. Using constructed marsh age as the independent variable and functional indicator values as dependent variables, nonlinear regression analyses produced several ecologically meaningful trajectories (r (2) > 0.9), demonstrating that the use of different-aged marshes can be a viable approach to developing functional trajectories. The trajectories illustrated that although indicators of some functions (primary production, sediment deposition, and plant species richness) may reach natural site values relatively quickly (<10 years), others (soil organic matter content) will take longer.

TI  - Characterisation of the hydrology of an estuarine wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal zone of estuarine wetlands is characterised by a transition from a saline marine environment to a freshwater environment with increasing distance from tidal streams. An experimental site has been established in an area of mangrove and salt marsh wetland in the Hunter River estuary, Australia, to characterise and provide data for a model of intertidal zone hydrology. The experimental site is designed to monitor water fluxes at a small scale (36 m). A weather station and groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and hydraulic head and tidal levels are monitored over a 10-week period along a short one-dimensional transect covering the transition between the tidal and freshwater systems. Soil properties have been determined in the laboratory and the field. A two-dimensional finite element model of the site was developed using SEEP/W to analyse saturated and unsaturated pore water movement. Modification of the water retention function to model crab hole macropores was found necessary to reproduce the observed aquifer response. Groundwater response to tidal fluctuations was observed to be almost uniform beyond the intertidal zone, due to the presence of highly permeable subsurface sediments below the less permeable surface sediments. Over the 36 m transect, tidal forcing was found to generate incoming fluxes in the order of 0.22 m(3)/day per metre width of creek bank during dry periods, partially balanced by evaporative fluxes of about 0.13 m(3)/day per metre width. During heavy rainfall periods, rainfall fluxes were about 0.61 m(3)/day per metre width, dominating the water balance. Evapotranspiration rates were greater for the salt marsh dominated intertidal zone than the non-tidal zone. Hypersalinity and salt encrustation observed show that evapotranspiration fluxes are very important during non-rainfall periods and are believed to significantly influence salt concentration both in the surface soil matrix and the underlying aquifer.

TI  - Effects of common reed (Phragmites australis) expansions on nitrogen dynamics of tidal marshes of the northeastern US
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several recent studies indicate that the replacement of extant species with Phragmites australis can alter the size of nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes within tidal marshes. Some common effects of P. australis expansion are increased standing stocks of N, greater differentiation of N concentrations between plant tissues (high N leaves and low N stems), and slower whole-plant decay rates than competing species (e.g., Spartina, Typha spp.). Some of the greater differences between marsh types involve R australis effects on extractable and porewater pools of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and N mineralization rates. Brackish and salt marshes show higher concentrations of DIN in porewater beneath Spartina spp. relative to R australis, but this is not observed in freshwater tidal marshes when P australis is compared with Typha spp. or mixed plant assemblages. With few studies of concurrent N fluxes, the net effect of P australis on marsh N budgets is difficult to quantify for single sites and even more so between sites. The magnitude and direction of impacts of R australis on N cycles appears to be system-specific, driven more by the system and species being invaded than by P australis itself. Where P. australis is found to affect N pools and fluxes, we suggest these alterations result from increased biomass (both aboveground and belowground) and increased allocation of that biomass to recalcitrant stems. Because N pools are commonly greater in P australis than in most other communities (due to plant and litter uptake), one of the most critical questions remaining is "From where is the extra N in R australis communities coming?" It is important to determine if the source of the new N is imported (e.g., anthropogenic) or internally produced (e.g., fixed, remineralized organic matter). In order to estimate net impacts of P australis on marsh N budgets, we suggest that further research be focused on the N source that supports high standing stocks of N in P australis biomass (external input versus internal cycling) and the relative rates of N loss from different marshes (burial versus subsurface flow versus denitrification).

TI  - POREWATER CHEMISTRY OF NATURAL AND CREATED MARSH SOILS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemistry of porewaters and soils were compared in a low organic matter (1%) created marsh established on an upland site in 1983 and a high organic matter (almost-equal-to 50%) natural marsh nearby to characterize the role of created wetlands in estuarine nutrient cycles. Porewater physico-chemical properties (water level, temperature, salinity, dissolved O2, pH, redox potential (Eh), Fe, Mn) and nutrient (organic C, N, P, NH4, NO3, PO,) concentrations were monitored monthly for 1 yr in the two marshes. Soil nutrients (organic C, N, P), physical properties (bulk density, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity) and chemical characteristics (Eh, pH, Fe, Mn, Al) also were measured at the end of the study. 5 yr after emergent vegetation was established, the conversion from upland porewater and soil properties to typical wetland characteristics was incomplete. Dissolved O2, Eh, Fe, Mn and NO3-N were significantly higher in created marsh porewaters as compared to porewaters collected from the natural marsh. The created marsh also contained lower porewater dissolved organic C and N, NH4-N and PO4-P and had lower pH. Soil bulk density and extractable Fe were significantly higher, and porosity, hydraulic conductivity, pH, total organic C and N, and exchangeable NH4-N and NO3-N were lower in the created marsh than in the natural marsh soil. These results imply that mitigation of wetland disturbance by creating wetlands on graded upland sites, initially, may not duplicate the hydrologic and nutrient cycling functions associated with natural wetlands that have developed over many years.

TI  - Goose-induced changes in vegetation and land cover between 1976 and 1997 in an arctic coastal marsh
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1970s, a breeding colony of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens L.) at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, has grown 8% annually. This increase has led to significant loss of plant cover in all major salt- and freshwater coastal habitats between 1976 and 1997. A series of transects established in 1976 was resurveyed in 1997. Exposed sediment, extent and type of vegetative cover, and aquatic areas were recorded along transects using a classification of 12 a priori classes. Five regions within the colony were identified, and changes in vegetation cover differed among these and depended on unique combinations of vegetation class and year. Grubbing by geese has led to loss of graminoid plants, especially in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Exposed sediments have largely replaced previously vegetated areas since 1976. Species characteristic of disturbed sites have colonized exposed sediment with the most abundant species varying according to soil conditions. In intertidal marshes, willow cover declined in association with the development of hypersalinity after loss of the graminoid mat, but willow cover increased at the base of well-drained beach ridges and in a river delta with ample winter snow accumulation and freshwater flow in spring that protected ground vegetation. Most of the expected successional trends associated with isostatic uplift and changes in soil organic matter failed to occur because of intense goose foraging throughout the 20 years. The likelihood of sustained recovery of plant communities in the immediate coastal zone is very low, as long as goose numbers continue to increase. Indirect effects of vegetation loss (e.g., hypersalinity) and subsequent erosion of exposed sediments following grubbing will delay plant colonization and retard succession.

T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Killifish are ecologically important components of salt marsh ecosystems, but no studies have determined the importance of locally produced versus allochthonous food sources on a scale of less than multiple kilometers. The goal of our study was to examine diet and movement of the killifish, Fundulus heteroditus, collected from a Maine salt marsh to assess the importance of locatly produced versus allochthonous food sources on a scale of several hundred meters. We compared the gut contents and stable isotope signatures of F. heteroditus from four regions along the central river of a Maine salt marsh to the distinct food sources and isotopic signatures of the region of the marsh in which they were caught. F. heteroditus were relying on locally produced food sources even on the scale of several hundred meters. They fed daily in a small area less than 6 ha and maintained relatively strong site fidelities over the course of several months. Phytoplankton and salt marsh detritus both contributed to the high production of F. heteroclitus, terrestrial plant detritus was not an important component of their diet. The diet and feeding patterns of F. heteroditus from this small Maine salt marsh were similar to the patterns found in much larger salt marshes, suggesting that locally produced organic matter is essential to the production of these ecologically important fish.

TI  - Nutrient enrichment and precipitation changes do not enhance resiliency of salt marshes to sea level rise in the Northeastern U.S.
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Northeastern U.S., salt marsh area is in decline. Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and marsh drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Measures of marsh vegetation loss for eight sites in Rhode Island and New York between ca.1970 and 2011 indicate that substantial loss has occurred over past decades, with higher loss rates found for lower elevation salt marshes. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and LiDAR datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast, and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We estimate that 87 % of Northeastern salt marshes are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation regime was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.

TI  - Potential effects of future land-use change on regional carbon stocks in the UK
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the impact of land-use change on carbon (C) stocks in South West England, three scenarios were explored based on current UK national- and regional-scale policies and plans. The scenarios assessed were: (i) Rebuilding Biodiversity (RB), involving habitat restoration of 824,244 ha of strategic nature areas; (ii) Forest Strategy (FS), involving establishment of 16,000 ha of new woodlands; and (iii) Biomass Strategy (BS), involving conversion of 65,513 ha of arable land into bioenergy crops. It was assumed that each of these targets would be implemented by the year 2020, with carbon build-up times of 100, 100 and 30 years, respectively. Estimates of C-stock changes were produced by compiling vegetation and soil organic C-density data for 11 land-use types from a systematic literature review. Results indicated that FS would lead to the highest yearly potential carbon sequestration (up to 3.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, the total C-stocks would be the highest under RB (up to 20% increase), owing to the greater area of pastures and arable land being converted into broadleaved forest when compared to FS. BS would have the least effect on C (C-stock increase of up to 0.3% and up to 0.41 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) sequestered). The spatially explicit analytical approach adopted here provides an indication of which land-use changes would contribute most to C-sequestration within the South West region, and could contribute to achieving national emission reduction targets post-2012.

TI  - Salinity Influence on Methane Emissions from Tidal Marshes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between methane emissions and salinity is not well understood in tidal marshes, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of marsh conservation and restoration on greenhouse gas balance. We used published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity > 18) had significantly lower methane emissions (mean +/- sd = 1 +/- 2 gm(-2) yr(-1)) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in methane emissions from fresh (salinity=0-0.5) and mesohaline (5-18) marshes (42 +/- 76 and 16 +/- 11 gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while oligohaline (0.5-5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane emissions (150 +/- 221 gm(-2) yr(-1)). Annual methane emissions were modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane flux (log(CH4) - -0.056 x salinity + 1: 38; r(2) = 0.52; p < 0.0001). Managers interested in using marshes as greenhouse gas sinks can assume negligible methane emissions in polyhaline systems, but need to estimate or monitor methane emissions in lower-salinity marshes.

TI  - Fifteen years of vegetation and soil development after brackish-water marsh creation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter (MOM), and wetland soil characteristics were measured periodically between 1983 and 1998 in a created brackish-water marsh and a nearby natural marsh along the Pamlico River estuary, North Carolina to evaluate the development of wetland vegetation and soil dependent functions after marsh creation. Development of aboveground biomass and MOM was dependent on elevation and frequency of tidal inundation. Aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora , which occupied low elevations along tidal creeks and was inundated frequently, developed to levels similar to the natural marsh (750 to 1,300 g/m(2) ) within three years after creation. Spartina cynosuroides , which dominated interior areas of the marsh and was flooded less frequently, required 9 years to consistently achieve aboveground biomass equivalent to the natural marsh (600 to 1,560 g/m(2) ). Aboveground biomass of Spartina patens , which was planted at the highest elevations along the terrestrial margin and seldom flooded, never consistently developed aboveground biomass comparable with the natural marsh during the 15 years after marsh creation. MOM (0 to 10 cm) generally developed at the same rate as aboveground biomass. Between 1988 and 1998, soil bulk density decreased and porosity and organic C and N pools increased in the created marsh. Like vegetation, wetland soil development proceeded faster in response to increased inundation, especially in the streamside zone dominated by S. alterniflora. We estimated that in the streamside and interior zones, an additional 30 years (nitrogen) to 90 years (organic C, porosity) are needed for the upper 30 cm of created marsh soil to become equivalent to the natural marsh. Wetland soil characteristics of the S. patens community along upland fringe will take longer to develop, more than 200 years. Development of the benthic invertebrate-based food web, which depends on organic matter enrichment of the upper 5 to 10 cm of soil, is expected to take less time. Wetland soil characteristics and functions of created irregularly flooded brackish marshes require longer to develop compared with regularly flooded salt marshes because reduced tidal inundation slows wetland vegetation and soil development. The hydrologic regime (regularly vs. irregularly flooded) of the "target" wetland should be considered when setting realistic expectations for success criteria of created and restored wetlands.

TI  - Phosphorus and DOC availability influence the partitioning between bacterioplankton production and respiration in tidal marsh ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The organic carbon consumed by aquatic bacteria (BCC) is partitioned between bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), but the factors that determine BCC and its partition into BP and BR are not well understood. We explored the coupling between BR, BR and BCC, and their links to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability in natural and restored tidal marshes and in the adjoining waters of Delaware Bay estuary. Labile DOC (LDOC) ranged from 3% to 22% of the DOC pool, and explained more of the variance in both BR and BCC than did bulk DOC. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable (0.090.58), and natural Spartina alterniflora marshes had consistently higher BGE than both restoration marshes and tidal floodwaters. BGE was negatively related to the ratio of LDOC to total dissolved phosphorous, which was highest in natural marshes. The enhancement of BP observed in the marshes relative to the estuarine floodwaters had different origins: In natural marshes it was mostly due to increases in BGE, whereas in restored marshes it followed increased BCC. These results highlight the importance of P in regulating microbial metabolism in coastal areas, and the need to understand the pathways that lead to BP in these systems.

TI  - Endophytic Cultivable Bacteria of the Metal Bioaccumulator Spartina maritima Improve Plant Growth but Not Metal Uptake in Polluted Marshes Soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Endophytic bacterial population was isolated from Spartina maritima tissues, a heavy metal bioaccumulator cordgrass growing in the estuaries of Tinto, Odiel, and Piedras River (south west Spain), one of the most polluted areas in the world. Strains were identified and ability to tolerate salt and heavy metals along with plant growth promoting and enzymatic properties were analyzed. A high proportion of these bacteria were resistant toward one or several heavy metals and metalloids including As, Cu, and Zn, the most abundant in plant tissues and soil. These strains also exhibited multiple enzymatic properties as amylase, cellulase, chitinase, protease and lipase, as well as plant growth promoting properties, including nitrogen fixation, phosphates solubilization, and production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. The best performing strains (Micrococcus yunnanensis SMJ12, Vibrio sagamiensis SMJ18, and Salinicola peritrichatus SMJ30) were selected and tested as a consortium by inoculating S. maritima wild plantlets in greenhouse conditions along with wild polluted soil. After 30 days, bacterial inoculation improved plant photosynthetic traits and favored intrinsic water use efficiency. However, far from stimulating plant metal uptake, endophytic inoculation lessened metal accumulation in above and belowground tissues. These results suggest that inoculation of S. maritima with indigenous metal resistant endophytes could mean a useful approach in order to accelerate both adaption and growth of this indigenous cordgrass in polluted estuaries in restorative operations, but may not be suitable for rhizoaccumulation purposes.

TI  - The impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools in invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Suaeda salsa salt marshes in eastern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of sea embankments is an increasingly common approach for controlling the spread of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in coastal wetlands of eastern China. However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh. Sea embankment reclamation could greatly weaken the C and N sinks of S. alterniflora salt marsh and potentially affect C and N sinks in the coastal wetlands of eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Species diversity index decreased with increase of Na content of soil correlation coefficient with of -0.82. The aboveground biomass of plant communities were 2.981 g .cntdot. dw [dry weight]/m2 in P. communis, 1.471 g .cntdot. dw/m2 in Z. sinica, 189 g .cntdot. dw/m2 in S. herbacea and 71 g .cntdot. dw/m2 L. tetragonum, respectively. Seasonal changes of inorganic nutrients contents per unit land area coincided with those of biomass of plant communities, but the maximum contents of K occurred earlier than the maximum biomass. Amounts of inorganic nutrients absorbed by plants were directly proportional to their biomass and indirectly proportional to restored amounts of them in soil. In turnover times of nutrients of the communities, the shortest time was for P, the longest for Ca. P. communis community took the shortest time but L. tetragonum the longest. E.g., in P. communis turnover time of P took 1 yr and that of Na 1.440 yr. Lack of P was expected in this study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico shoreline received varied types and amounts of weathered oil residues after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.

TI  - Determination of food web support and trophic position of the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, in New Jersey smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), common reed (Phragmites australis), and restored salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of Phragmites australis into tidal marshes formerly dominated by Spartina alterniflora has resulted in considerable interest in the consequences of this invasion for the ecological functions of marsh habitat. We examined the provision of trophic support for a resident marsh fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, in marshes dominated by P. australis, by S. alterniflora, and in restored marshes, using multiple stable isotope analysis. We first evaluated our ability to distinguish among potential primary producers using the multiple stable isotope approach. Within a tidal creek system we found significant marsh and elevation effects on microalgal isotope values, and sufficient variability and overlap in primary producer isotope values to create some difficulty in identifying unique end members. The food webs supporting E heteroclitus production were examined using dual isotope plots. At both sites, the delta(13)C values of E heteroclitus were clustered over values for benthic microalgae (BMI) and approximately midway between delta(13)C values of Spartina and Phragmites. Based on comparisons of fish and primary producer delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S values, and consideration of E heteroclitus feeding habits, we conclude that BMI were a significant component of the food web supporting F heteroclitus in these brackish marshes, especially recently-hatched fish occupying pools on the marsh surface. A 2parts per thousand difference in delta(13)C between Fundulus occupying nearly adjacent Spartina and Phragmites marshes may be indicative of relatively less reliance on BMI and greater reliance on Phragmites production in Phragmites-dominated marshes, a conclusion consistent with the reduced BMI biomass found in Phragmites marshes. The mean delta(13)C value of F heteroclitus from restored marshes was intermediate between values of fish from naturally occurring Spartina marshes and areas invaded by Phragmites. We also examined the isotopic evidence for ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of larval and juvenile F heteroclitus. We found significant positive relationships between E heteroclitus WIN values and total length, reflective of an increase in trophic position as fish grow. F heteroclitus delta(15)N values indicate that these fish are feeding approximately two trophic levels above primary producers.

TI  - Tidal Marshes across a Chesapeake Bay Subestuary Are Not Keeping up with Sea-Level Rise
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise is a major factor in wetland loss worldwide, and in much of Chesapeake Bay (USA) the rate of sea-level rise is higher than the current global rate of 3.2 mm yr(-1) due to regional subsidence. Marshes along estuarine salinity gradients differ in vegetation composition, productivity, decomposition pathways, and sediment dynamics, and may exhibit different responses to sea-level rise. Coastal marshes persist by building vertically at rates at or exceeding regional sea-level rise. In one of the first studies to examine elevation dynamics across an estuarine salinity gradient, we installed 15 surface elevation tables (SET) and accretion marker-horizon plots (MH) in tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and brackish marshes across a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Over the course of four years, wetlands across the subestuary decreased 1.8 +/- 2.7 mm yr(-1) in elevation on average, at least 5 mm yr(-1) below that needed to keep pace with global sea-level rise. Elevation change rates did not significantly differ among the marshes studied, and ranged from -9.8 +/- 6.9 to 4.5 +/- 4.3 mm yr(-1). Surface accretion of deposited mineral and organic matter was uniformly high across the estuary (similar to 9-15 mm yr(-1)), indicating that elevation loss was not due to lack of accretionary input. Position in the estuary and associated salinity regime were not related to elevation change or surface matter accretion. Previous studies have focused on surface elevation change in marshes of uniform salinity (e.g., salt marshes); however, our findings highlight the need for elevation studies in marshes of all salinity regimes and different geomorphic positions, and warn that brackish, oligohaline, and freshwater tidal wetlands may be at similarly high risk of submergence in some estuaries.

TI  - Biota-mediated carbon cycling-A synthesis of biotic-interaction controls on blue carbon
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Research into biotic interactions has been a core theme of ecology for over a century. However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.

TI  - Effects of elevated CO2 on organic matter decomposition capacities and community structure of sulfate-reducing bacteria in salt marsh sediment
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Field Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2 affects the soil carbon cycle by influencing microbial activity and the carbon pool. In this study, the effects of elevated CO2 on extracellular enzyme activities (FEA; beta-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, aminopeptidase) in salt marsh sediment vegetated with Suaeda japonica were assessed under ambient atmospheric CO2 concentration (380 ppm) or elevated CO2 concentration (760 ppm) conditions. Additionally, the community structure of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was analyzed via terminal restriction fragments length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Sediment with S. japonica samples were collected from the Hwangsando intertidal flat in May 2005, and placed in small pots (diameter 6 cm, height 10 cm). The pots were incubated for 60 days in a growth chamber under two different CO2 concentration conditions. Sediment samples for all measurements were subdivided into two parts: surface (0-2 cm) and rhizome (4-6 cm) soils. No significant differences were detected in EEA with different CO2 treatments in the surface and rhizome soils. However, the ratio of beta-glucosidase activity to N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in rhizome soil was significantly lower (P < 0.01) at 760 ppm CO2 than at 380 ppm CO2, thereby suggesting that the contribution of fungi to the decomposition of soil organic matter might in some cases prove larger than that of bacteria. Community structures of SRB were separated according to different CO2 treatments, suggesting that elevated CO2 may affect the carbon and sulfur cycle in salt marshes.

TI  - Summer-time denitrification and nitrous oxide exchange in the intertidal zone of the Yangtze Estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment denitrification rates and nitrous oxide (N2O) exchange fluxes in the Yangtze estuary intertidal zone (mudflats and salt marshes) were measured in summer-time using an acetylene inhibition technique and an in situ static closed chamber method. N2O natural production rates ranged between 0.10 pmol N m(-2) h(-1) and 8.50 pmol N m(-2) h(-1), and the denitrification rates ranged from 18.71 pmol N m(-2) h(-1) to 35.87 pmol N m(-2) h(-1). The N2O natural production rates in overlying water were low, with intertidal sediment being the source of overlying water N2O during the submerged period. Data analysis indicated that most sediment N2O was not derived from denitrification, but from several other nitrogen-cycling processes. During the low tide, the middle tidal marsh was the source of atmosphere N2O (exchange fluxes changed between -11.03 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) and 13.17 pmol N m(-2) h(-1)). 5 cm and 10 cm depth ground temperatures were significant factors controlling the emission flux. At the low tidal flat, N2O emission flux rates ranged from -5.75 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) to 0.49 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) at the sediment-atmosphere interface. Overall, the middle tidal marsh was the source of atmospheric N20, while the low tidal flat was a sink for atmospheric N2O. Plants of the intertidal zone (Scirpus mariqueter and benthic algae) were significant factors controlling N20 exchange flux. Photosynthesis of intertidal zone plants inhibited the emission of N20 and induced consumption, while plant respiration may enhance N20 emission from the interidal zone. N2O emission and consumption at the intertidal zone-atmosphere interface correlated positively with the emission and consumption of CO2. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do Spartina maritima Plantations Enhance the Macroinvertebrate Community in European Salt Marshes?
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration of salt marshes using plantations may enhance the macroinvertebrate community, but little is known about the development of benthic macroinvertebrates after ecological engineering projects in European salt marshes. This study analyzed the environment and the macroinvertebrate community in European salt marshes 3 years after restoration using Spartina maritima plantations in comparison with non-restored and preserved marshes in Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Our study offers new information about the role of salt marsh plants in mediating faunal communities via ecological engineering projects.

TI  - Effect of crude oil and chemical additives on metabolic activity of mixed microbial populations in fresh marsh soils
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrocarbons increase abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms, but also decrease microbial diversity. This could disrupt ecosystem dynamics by altering soil organic matter mineralization and resultant nutrient remineralization rates. Crude oil, which is known to contain toxins and reduce microbial diversity, was hypothesized to reduce gross metabolic activity of mixed microbial populations in wetland soils. Soil respiration and Eh were compared, for 6 months, among microcosms containing marsh soils that differed in soil organic matter (Panicum hemitomon Shult. or Sagittaria lancifolia L. dominated marshes), crude oil (Arabian crude, Louisiana crude, or no oil), and additives (a cleaner, a dispersant, fertilizer, or no additive). No treatment slowed activity; instead, Louisiana plus fertilizer and all Arabian treatments temporarily accelerated activity. Additional C respired from oiled microcosms exceeded C added as crude oil by 1.4 to 3.5 times. Thus, much additional C originated from soil organic matter rather than crude oil. Crude oils temporarily lowered soil Eh, which is consistent with accelerated metabolism and demand for electron accepters. The lack of inhibition observed at the community level does not necessarily indicate an absence of toxicity. Instead, tolerant species with metabolic versatility probably maintained activity. Stimulation probably resulted from removal of micronutrient limitation, rather than removal of grazing pressure or macronutrient limitation. Regardless, accelerated soil organic matter mineralization surely accelerated nutrient remineralization. This might explain some reports of crude oil stimulating plant growth. These results are not inconsistent with theoretical and experimental conclusions regarding effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability and productivity, nor are they inconsistent with conclusions that crude oils contain components that are toxic to microbes, vegetation, and fauna. However, these data do indicate that crude oils also contain components that temporarily stimulate metabolic activity of surviving microbes.

TI  - Incomplete tidal restoration may lead to persistent high CH4 emission
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide a range of critical ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Recent recognition of the importance of these ecosystems has led to an interest in restoring marshes that have been degraded by human activities. Tidal restriction from coastal development can alter salt marsh plant and animal communities as well as marsh biogeochemistry. However, much less is known about how tidal restriction, and subsequent tidal restoration, may alter greenhouse gas emissions. Since salt marshes typically have lower emissions of methane than freshwater wetlands, tidal restoration that increases the salinity in a restricted marsh could theoretically improve the net global warming potential of a marsh by lowering methane emissions. In this study, we examined the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at four temperate salt marshes, three of which had been restricted and subsequently restored. Greenhouse gas fluxes were poorly correlated with environmental parameters (biomass, temperature, moisture, sediment organic content, porewater salinity and pH, etc.) normally considered to be primary drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical processes. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions and uptake were not influenced by the restriction and restoration history of the marshes. Despite comparable salinity, methane emissions in one partially restored marsh were 25 times higher than those in unimpacted reference sites 13+ years after restoration. However, methane emissions from the other restored sites were equal to or significantly lower than those from unimpacted reference sites. This study highlights that we cannot assume recovering ecosystems will function like unimpacted ones, especially if restoration is incomplete.

AB  - A soil with a high organic content, a calcaric phaeozem, has been imaged in a hydrated state using the Stony Brook scanning transmission X-ray microscope at the NSLS, Brookhaven, USA. This experiment has been performed at the carbon K absorption edge to determine the distribution of organic matter within this soil. Spectromicroscopic methods using the known spectra of humics are helping to distinguish between different kinds of carbon in the sample. In addition, a marsh soil from Northern Germany has been analyzed at the sulfur K-absorption edge with the scanning X-ray microscope at the ESRF (ID 21), Grenoble, France. This soil contains a variety of sulfur containing components, which are attached to the soil colloids. A major source of these components is the microbial activity. In this soil it is possible to identify spectroscopically amino acids like methionin and cysteine and proteins, which are built up from those molecules, and inorganic components like sulfates and sulfides.

AB  - Restoring and protecting "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows - are proposed actions for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model, the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon Model, to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for five management scenarios: (1) No Net Change, (2) Managed Retreat, (3) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (4) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (5) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. The dataset contains the following information for the timepoints of 2030, 2050, and 2100:- Total net carbon sequestration (Mg CO2 ha-1), can be positive or negative- Net present value of carbon sequestration (USD ha-1) using the market price of carbon using the Climate Solutions Fund (formerly the Emissions Reductions Fund)- Net present value of carbon sequestration (USD ha-1) using the Social Cost of CarbonFor each scenario, the data are provided as maps covering coastal Victoria, Australia. These maps show spatially explicit carbon gains and losses. This dataset and the methods used to produce it are explained in Moritsch et al.

TI  - Identifying the Salinity Thresholds that Impact Greenhouse Gas Production in Subtropical Tidal Freshwater Marsh Soils
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing salinity due to sea level rise is an important factor influencing biogeochemical processes in estuarine wetlands, with the potential to impact greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there is little consensus regarding what salinity thresholds will significantly alter the production of GHGs or the physiochemical properties of wetland soils. This study used a fine-scale salinity gradient to determine the impact of seawater concentration on the potential production of CH4, CO2 and N2O and associated soil properties using bottle incubations of tidal freshwater marsh soils from the Min River estuary, SE China. Potential CH4 production was unaffected by salinities from 0 to 7.5 parts per thousand, but declined significantly at 10 parts per thousand and above. Potential CO2 production was stimulated at intermediate salinities (5 to 7.5 parts per thousand), but inhibited by salinities >= 15 parts per thousand, while potential N2O production was unaffected by salinity. In contrast, soil dissolved organic carbon and NH4+-N generally increased with salinity. Overall, this research indicates salinities of similar to 10-15% represent an important tipping point for biogeochemical processes in wetlands. Above this threshold, carbon mineralization is reduced and may promote vertical soil accretion in brackish and salinity wetlands. Meanwhile, low-level saltwater intrusion may leave wetlands vulnerable to submergence due to accelerated soil organic carbon loss.

TI  - Nitrogen Pools of Macrophyte Species in a Coastal Lagoon Salt Marsh: Implications for Seasonal Storage and Dispersal
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High nitrogen (N) loading rates received by coastal bays can have deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems. Salt marshes can intercept land-based N through seasonal plant uptake, denitrification, and burial. Salt marshes fringing Delaware's Inland Bays are characterized by different plant species occurring in close proximity. To evaluate N pool retention and loss for the dominant plant species, we measured seasonal N concentration and pool size, N resorption efficiency, loss during decomposition, and soil N. Seasonal variation in N pools and fluxes differed among species. Seasonal differences in the total N pools of the herbaceous species were largely influenced by belowground fine root and dead macro-organic matter fluxes. N production rate estimates ranged from 18 g N m(-2) year(-1) aboveground for the high marsh shrub to 40.8 g N m(-2) year(-1) above- and belowground for the high marsh rush illustrating the importance of incorporating species-specific dynamics into ecosystem N budgets.

TI  - Long-term organic carbon sequestration in tidal marsh sediments is dominated by old-aged allochthonous inputs in a macrotidal estuary
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal marshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that are often considered as hot-spots of atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.

TI  - Distinct life histories of peracarid crustaceans in a Ria Formosa salt marsh (S. Portugal)
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Pitfall traps were exposed between February 1993 and September 1994 every 4th to 6th week near the high water mark in a Ria Formosa salt marsh (Portugal). With only a few exceptions, peracarid crustaceans accounted for more than 95% of the individuals caught. Three amphipod species (Orchestia gammarellus (Pallas), Orchestia mediterranean Costa, Talorchestia deshayesii (Audouin)) and 3 isopod species (Tylos ponticus (Arcangeli). Halophloscia couchi (Kinahan) and Porcellio lamellatus (Uljanin) Budde-Lund) were identified. In general, these species were most active from spring to autumn. Data collected included information on growth rate, life expectancy and timing of reproduction. The amphipods displayed more opportunistic life-history patterns with high growth rates, reproductive activity during most of the year, early sexual maturity and relatively short life expectancies. The isopods were more persistent with slower growth rates, more restricted reproductive periods and longer life expectancies. There is no indication in the literature that most of these species are particularly common in salt marshes. In addition, peracarid crustaceans are not mentioned as dominant taxa in most studies of salt marsh fauna. We suggest that the peracarids play an important role in the degradation of organic matter in salt marshes and hypothesize that the high numbers of peracarids found in Ria Formosa is due to the high contribution of leaf shedding plants.

TI  - Diversity of the ring-cleaving dioxygenase gene pcaH in a salt marsh bacterial community
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation of lignin-related aromatic compounds is an important ecological process in the highly productive salt marshes of the southeastern United States, yet little is known about the mediating organisms or their catabolic pathways. Here we report the diversity of a gene encoding a key ring-cleaving enzyme of the beta -ketoadipate pathway, pcaH, amplified from bacterial communities associated with decaying Spartina alterniflora, the salt marsh grass that dominates these coastal systems, as well as from enrichment cultures with aromatic substrates (p-hydroxybenzoate, anthranilate, vanillate, and dehydroabietate). Sequence analysis of 149 pcaH clones revealed 85 unique sequences. Thirteen of the 53 amino acid residues compared were invariant in the PcaH proteins, suggesting that these residues have a required catalytic or structural function. Fifty-eight percent of the clones matched sequences amplified from a collection of 36 bacterial isolates obtained from seawater, marine sediments, or senescent Spartina. Fifty-two percent of the pcaH clones could be assigned to the roseobacter group, a marine lineage of the class alpha -Proteobacteria abundant in coastal ecosystems. Another 6% of the clones matched genes retrieved from isolates belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Stappia, and 42% of the clones could not be assigned to a cultured bacterium based on sequence identity. These results suggest that the diversity of the genes encoding a single step in aromatic compound degradation in the coastal marsh examined is high.

TI  - Seasonal and annual variations in the volumetric sediment balance of a macro-tidal salt marsh
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability in the volumetric sediment balance of Allen Creek marsh, a macro-tidal salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy. The volumetric balance was determined as the balance of inputs of sediments and organic matter via accretion on the marsh surface and Outputs of sedimentary material primarily due to erosion of the marsh margin. Changes in marsh surface elevation were measured at 20 buried plates and 3 modified sediment elevation tables from 1996 - 2002, and detailed margin surveys were conducted in 1997, 1999 and 2001 using a differential global positioning system. Changes in surface area were calculated using GIS overlay analysis and used in Conjunction with accretion and erosion data to derive volumetric estimates of gains and losses of sedimentary material in the marsh system.Currently the volumetric sediment balance at Allen Creek marsh is positive. However the processes of erosion and accretion demonstrate seasonal, annual and spatial variability. Inputs to the system include deposition oil the marsh surface from sediment laden waters and from ice rafting of sediments. Sediment is deposited onto the marsh surface year round, even during the winter when vegetation cover is sparse, and the amount of deposition in general is not significantly correlated with the frequency of tidal inundations. Based oil the data from 1996 to 2002, the mid and high marsh zones experience mean accretion rates of approximately 1.4 cm year(-1) whereas accretion rates in the low marsh region are statistically significantly lower (0.8 cm year(-1)). The absolute amount of accretion varies between seasons and from year to year. The main loss to the marsh is through erosion of the marsh margin cliffs which can remove a comparatively large Volume of sedimentary material in one mass wasting event and which also decreases the vegetated surface area available for deposition from sediment laden waters. The volume of material removed from the marsh margin almost tripled between 1997 (169 m(3)) and 2001 (502 m(3)) following breaching of the side of a tidal creek channel, altering the patterns of margin erosion and deposition in the marsh system. During this time, however, other sheltered areas of the marsh system, such as along the tidal creek banks, showed evidence of new vegetation growth, increasing the amount of vegetated surface area available for deposition.The processes of erosion and deposition on the marsh surface exhibit considerable spatial variability, with different regions of the marsh being more or less sensitive to seasonal variability in the dominant controls influencing sediment deposition and erosion in this system, namely wave activity, vegetation, ice and water depths. A key factor in predicting how a marsh will evolve and respond to a number of different controls, e.g. sea-level rise or reduced sediment supply, is to quantify both accretion of the marsh surface and erosion of the marsh margin, evaluating the marsh system as a volumetric whole. This study demonstrates that a marsh system should be assessed in three dimensions rather than simply as a surface of accumulation. This is particularly important for open coastal marshes exposed to the erosive action of waves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rigths reserved.

TI  - Biomass accumulation during reed encroachment reduces efficiency of restoration of Baltic coastal grasslands
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Question: To what extent is restoration of vegetation in coastal grasslands delayed by accumulation of nutrients after abandonment of traditional management and subsequent reed encroachment? How does nutrient flow in the plant-soil system react to reintroduction of grazing?Location: Coast of Baltic Sea, western Estonia.Methods: Abandoned, continuously managed and restored coastal meadows were selected in four different study regions and their vegetation composition sampled. Nitrogen, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg concentrations and C/N ratios were determined in both vegetation and soil. Differences between management groups were evaluated.Results: Comparison among different management groups revealed several differences in both relative and total amount of nutrients in soil and vegetation. Most soil properties of restored sites were similar to those in abandoned sites. Carbon stock in the soil profile doubled after abandonment, total N concentration in the top soil layer increased while plant available P concentration decreased. The phytomass and chemical composition of phytomass rapidly changed back to a 'normal' level after restoration. Species composition remained different, but species typical of coastal grasslands were present in restored sites. There was a strong site specificity in the results.Conclusions: Re-establishment of grazing had a rapid impact on plant biomass of coastal grasslands. Species composition responded more slowly, but target species returned relatively quickly. Slow recovery of soil properties, however, means that the results of restoration may be fragile and return of tall-growth vegetation is very probable if managent intensity declines. Long restoration periods should be planned to reach pre-abandonment environmental conditions when using non-destructive restoration methods.

TI  - Effects of wetland plant biochars on heavy metal immobilization and enzyme activity in soils from the Yellow River estuary.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of wetland plant biochars on the enzyme activity in heavy metal contaminated soil. The biochars were produced from Phragmites australis (PB), Suaeda salsa (SB), and Tamarix chinensis (TB) under different pyrolysis temperatures and times. The detected pyrolysis products showed that the ash, pH, electrical conductivity, and carbon content of the biochars increased significantly, while the production rate of the biochars decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature and time. The results of the adsorption experiments indicated that biochar addition could effectively reduce the concentration of Pb and/or Cd in the Pb2+/Cd2+ single or mixed solutions, but the Pb2+ and Cd2+ in the mixed solution indicated a competitive adsorption. A 30-day incubation experiment was conducted using salt marsh soil amended with different biochar application rates to investigate the short-term effects of biochar addition on Pb and Cd immobilization. The PB and SB significantly immobilized Pb within the first 15days, but Pb remobilized within the next 15-day period. In contrast, TB addition did not significantly fix Pb. Moreover, biochar addition promoted the conversion of Cd from the residue to the less immobile fractions. The addition of three types of plant biochar had no significant effect on the urease activity in wetland soil but significantly increased soil sucrase activity. PB and SB significantly promoted catalase activity, while TB significantly inhibited soil catalase activity. According to the adsorption effect, the fixation effect, and the promotion of enzyme activities, the Suaeda salsa biochars are suitable for the remediation of heavy metal pollution in wetland soils.

TI  - Lignocellulose-responsive bacteria in a southern California salt marsh identified by stable isotope probing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon cycling by microbes has been recognized as the main mechanism of organic matter decomposition and export in coastal wetlands, yet very little is known about the functional diversity of specific groups of decomposers (e.g., bacteria) in salt marsh benthic trophic structure. Indeed, salt marsh sediment bacteria remain largely in a black box in terms of their diversity and functional roles within salt marsh benthic food web pathways. We used DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) utilizing C-13-labeled lignocellulose as a proxy to evaluate the fate of macrophyte-derived carbon in benthic salt marsh bacterial communities. Overall, 146 bacterial species were detected using SIP of which only 12 lineages were shared between enriched and non-enriched communities. Abundant groups from the C-13-labeled community included Desulfosarcina, Spirochaeta, and Kangiella. This study is the first to use heavy-labeled lignocellulose to identify bacteria responsible for macrophyte carbon utilization in salt marsh sediments and will allow future studies to target specific lineages to elucidate their role in salt marsh carbon cycling and ultimately aid our understanding of the potential of salt marshes to store carbon.

AB  - Re-establishing plant cover is essential for restoring ecosystem functions, but revegetation can be difficult in severe sites, such as salt marshes that experience hypersalinity and sedimentation. We tested three treatments (adding tidal creeks, planting seedlings in tight clusters, and rototilling kelp compost into the soil) in a site that was excavated to reinstate tidal flows and restore salt marsh. The magnitude of responses was the reverse of expectations, with tidal creeks having the least effect and kelp compost the most. On the marsh plain, kelp compost significantly increased soil organic matter (by 17% at 0-5 cm; p = 0.026 and 11.5% at 5-20 cm; p = 0.083), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (45% at 5-8 cm; p < 0.001) and inorganic nitrogen (35% at 5-8 cm; p < 0.006), and decreased bulk density (16% at 0-5 cm; p < 0.001 and 21% at 5-8 cm depth; p < 0.001) compared to control plots. Survivorship of kelp compost treated plantings increased, along with growth ( > 50% increase in a growth index at 20 months after planting; p < 0.0001). In Spartina foliosa plots, kelp compost did not affect soil organic matter, but plants were taller (by similar to 11 cm; p = 0.003) and denser (47% more stems; p = 0.003). Planting seedlings 10-cm apart in tight clusters on the marsh plain increased survivorship by 18% (compared to 90-cm apart in loose clusters; p = 0.053), but not growth. Tidal creek networks increased survivorship of Batis maritima and Jaumea carnosa by >= 20% (p = 0.060 and 0.077, respectively). Kelp compost had a strong, positive influence on vegetation establishment by ameliorating some of the abiotic stress.

TI  - Surface elevation change and vegetation distribution dynamics in a subtropical coastal wetland: Implications for coastal wetland response to climate change
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise is receiving global attention and observed changes in the distribution of mangrove and salt marsh are increasingly associated with global climate change, particularly sea-level and temperature rise, and potentially elevated carbon dioxide. Processes operating over smaller-spatial scales, such as rainfall variability and nutrient enrichment are also proposed as possible short-term drivers of changes in the distribution of mangrove and salt marsh. We consider the response of mangrove and salt marsh in a subtropical estuary to changes in environmental variables over a 12 year period by comparing rates of surface elevation change and vegetation distribution dynamics to hydrological and climatic variables, specifically water level and rainfall. This period of analysis captured inter-annual variability in sea level and rainfall associated with different phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We found that the mangrove and salt marsh trend of increasing elevation was primarily controlled by position within the tidal prism, in this case defined by inundation depth and distance to the tidal channel. Rainfall was not a primary driver of elevation trends in mangrove and salt marsh, but rainfall and water level variability did influence variability in elevation over the study period, though cross-correlation of these factors confounds identification of a single process driving this variability. These results highlight the scale-dependence of coastal wetland vegetation distribution dynamics; the longer-term trend of surface elevation increase and mangrove encroachment of salt marsh correlated with global sea-level trends, while short-term variability in surface elevation was related to local variability in water level and rainfall. Rates of surface elevation increase were found to lag behind rates of water level change within the Tweed River, which may facilitate further expansion of mangrove into salt marsh. This study advocates integration of ecological and geomorphic techniques to understand the response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise and climatic perturbations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Benthic microalgae are a ubiquitous feature in sediments directly exposed to full sunlight or shaded by a vascular plant canopy in coastal salt marshes. Diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae are the dominant groups. Of these, diatoms are universally present and abundant, exhibit migratory rhythms driven mainly by light, and are by far the taxonomically most diverse group. Dense mats of cyanobacteria and secondarily green algae frequently develop where light levels are high. The more abundant species of all three algal groups are widely distributed within and among salt marshes of the United States and Europe. Standing crops of benthic microalgae beneath various vascular plant canopies exhibit mean annual values of 60 to 160 mg chi a m(-2). Annual benthic microalgal production (BMP) has been shown to range from 28 g C m(-2) y(-1) beneath (-2) 1 beneath Jaumea carnosa. In general, BMP Juncus roemerianus to 314 g C m(-2) y(-1) increases in a southerly direction in Atlantic coast marshes but is lowest in Gulf Coast marshes. In Atlantic and southern California marshes a significant portion of benthic microalgal production occurs when the overstory vascular plants are dormant. Experimental manipulations have shown that BMP and biomass beneath Spartina alterniflora are limited by nitrogen supplies and grazing activities. Manipulation of light appears to primarily affect the relative dominance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the benthic microalgal assemblage. The ratio of annual BMP to net aerial production of the overstory vascular plant canopy is 10 to 60% in Atlantic and Gulf Coast marshes and 75 to 140% in a southern California marsh. The benthic microalgal portion of this two component productivity system has been shown by multiple stable isotope studies to be a major component of salt marsh food webs. Diatoms, in particular, are the preferred food item of a diverse array of invertebrate and fish species.

TI  - Salt Marsh Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Microbial Communities Are Not Sensitive to the First Year of Precipitation Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing precipitation patterns are predicted to alter ecosystem structure and function with potential carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change. Influenced by both land and sea, salt marshes are unique ecosystems and their productivity and respiration responses to precipitation change differ from those observed in terrestrial ecosystems. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to climate-induced precipitation changes is largely unknown. We conducted 1-year precipitation manipulation experiments in the Spartina patens (high marsh) zone of two salt marshes and quantified ecosystem functions at both and microbial community structure at one. Precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant, although transient, impact on porewater salinity following storms at both sites, but most site conditions (nutrient concentrations, sediment moisture, and temperature) were unaffected. Extreme drought led to a subtle change in microbial community structure, but most ecosystem functions (primary productivity, litter decomposition, and greenhouse gas fluxes) were not affected by precipitation changes. The absence of ecosystem function change indicates functional redundancy (under extreme drought) and resistance (under doubled precipitation and seasonal intensification) exist in the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain function (including ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to resistance, resilience, and functional redundancy in the underlying microbial community.Plain Language Summary Precipitation change, especially the intensification of precipitation events (e.g., longer droughts and stronger storms) is an important aspect of human-caused global climate change. Salt marshes are important hotspots for carbon sequestration, so if precipitation changes alter the microbial processes that drive carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions in salt marshes, there could be an important feedback to the climate system. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to precipitation changes is largely unknown, so we conducted 1-year precipitation experiments in two salt marshes. We found that precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant impact on porewater salinity following storms, and one of the precipitation treatments (extreme drought) led to a subtle change in microbial community structure. However, ecosystem functions including greenhouse gas fluxes were not affected by any precipitation changes, regardless of changes to the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain their functions (including valuable ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to the stability of the underlying microbial community.

AB  - Ecosystems worldwide are experiencing the effects of climate change, and estuaries and salt marshes are no exception. The plant community will be one of the most affected elements by these climatic shifts, both in terms of structure and dynamics, with undeniable effects on its productivity. This thesis aims to study the effects of climate change on the marsh community dynamics, structure and productivity but also on its biogeochemical cycles and implications at the ecosystem level. Although special attention was given to primary productivity and plant physiology, a multidisciplinary approach was undertaken using both field assessments and mesocosmos trials. The results point out that these physically connected climatic changes are not only interconnected in a physical way but also at an ecological level. Mediterranean marshes will be more severely affected on their foundations, putting the entire ecosystem at risk and prone to climate change side effects and/or to synergistic events. The majority of the evaluated climatic changes have more negative impacts on the marsh pioneer species, affecting inevitably marsh establishment and expansion. Although to a lesser extent, the upper and middle marsh halophytes will also suffer from these climate-driven negative impacts. In addition, the appearance of resistant nonindigenous species (NIS) will add an increased threat to the marsh. The reduction of the pioneer zone in a large extension together with a middle marsh fragilization will open new ecological niches for the colonization of resistant NIS, imposing serious shifts in the marsh structure, dynamics and services provided to the estuarine ecosystem. This is even more evident when a holistic approach is undertaken focusing not only on plant physiology but also the marsh biogeochemistry and estuarine hydrological features. These evidences point out the need to adopt new management efforts, highlighting the desired marsh attributes and ecosystem services in the face of human activities that threaten salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM EFFECTS OF EXPANDING POPULATIONS OF AVICENNIA GERMINANS IN A LOUISIANA SALT MARSH
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The advancement of species poleward, due to global warming. has recently been documented worldwide. In Louisiana, Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) is moving northward into Spartina alterniflora salt marshes. Mangroves were historically restricted to southernmost islands and beaches by winter freezes; however. recently a noticeable expansion has occurred. The influence that mangroves have oil ecosystem processes within Louisiana salt marshes has not been documented. Thus. this research examined the effects of mangrove expansion oil sediment accretion, organic matter production and decomposition, and carbon assimilation, as well as edaphic parameters. Our results indicate that presently mangrove expansion has had no major effects on the ecosystem processes Measured. Sediment accretion, belowground production, decomposition. and carbon assimilation were similar between Avicennia and Spartina. Where mangroves expanded into the surrounding salt marsh, elevation. redox potential, bulk density, and soil ammonium Were slightly higher, while soil moisture and porewater salinity were somewhat lower. Because the mangroves are small ill stature and areal extent, significant effects oil ecosystem processes may presently be somewhat muted. However. if stands continue to grow. noted effects may occur ill the future. Our research provides a baseline from which future ecosystem responses may be evaluated as mangroves in Louisiana continue to develop.

TI  - Seasonal and diel patterns of biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and mosquitoes (Culicidae) on the Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island, SC, is surrounded by tidal salt marshes, which are breeding habitats for many pestiferous biting flies. Knowledge of biting fly behavior patterns is needed to develop effective pest management strategies in urban areas adjacent to salt marshes. We measured biting midge (Ceratopogonidae) and mosquito (Culicidae) seasonal abundance and diel activity patterns on Parris Island using CO2-baited suction traps from November 2001 - November 2004. Of the three biting midge species collected, Culicoides furens was most abundant (86.2% of total) and was present in high numbers from late March to November. Culicoides hollensis (12.0% of total) was present during spring and fall but absent in summer and winter; and Culicoides melleus (1.7% of total) was present in spring through fall but absent in winter. Abundance of C. furens had a positive linear correlation with air temperature and rainfall. There were nonlinear correlations between air temperature and C. hollensis and C. melleus numbers, which were most abundant at moderate temperatures. Of 18 mosquito species collected, the most abundant were Aedes taeniorhynchus (42.7% of total), Aedes sollicitans (26.3% of total), Culex salinarius (15.6% of total), Culex quinquefasciatus (7.3% of total), and Aedes vexans (5.7% of total); other species comprised <5% of collections. Aedes taeniorhynchus numbers were positively correlated with temperature and rainfall, and Cx. salinarius was correlated with soil moisture. Activity of most biting midges and mosquitoes were highest the first two hours following sunset. Species of biting flies were present in all months, suggesting that year-round control measures are necessary to reduce exposure to potential disease vectors and nuisance biting.

TI  - Trophic relationships in the Changjiang River estuarine salt marshes: preliminary investigation from delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain information on food web structure in salt marshes of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Estuary, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of primary producers and consumers were determined. The mean delta C-13 values of 31 dominant consumers ranged from -23.13 parts per thousand to -14.37 parts per thousand. Except for several species (Eriocheir sinensis, Sinonovacula constricta and Potamocorbula ustulata), consumers had intermediate delta C-13 values between those of benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. The mean delta N-15 values of 31 dominant consumers varied between 6.87 parts per thousand and 13.33 parts per thousand, which indicate three trophic levels in salt marshes of the Changjiang River Estuary. A total of 18 macroinvertebrates species and four fish species represented primary consumers with trophic levels ranging from 2.0 to 2.7. Secondary consumers included two macroinvertebrates and seven fishes with trophic levels varying between 3.0 and 3.9. The consumers were divided into three trophic guilds, i.e., detritivorous/algae feeders, omnivores and carnivores. The detrital food chain was the main energy flow pathway in the salt marsh food web of the Changjiang River Estuary, and the marsh vascular plants were at least as equally important as microphytobenthos for secondary production. The important trophic function of the salt marsh habitats in the estuary is revealed.

TI  - Elevated CO2 promotes long-term nitrogen accumulation only in combination with nitrogen addition
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeochemical models that incorporate nitrogen (N) limitation indicate that N availability will control the magnitude of ecosystem carbon uptake in response to rising CO2. Some models, however, suggest that elevated CO2 may promote ecosystem N accumulation, a feedback that in the long term could circumvent N limitation of the CO2 response while mitigating N pollution. We tested this prediction using a nine-year CO(2)xN experiment in a tidal marsh. Although the effects of CO2 are similar between uplands and wetlands in many respects, this experiment offers a greater likelihood of detecting CO2 effects on N retention on a decadal timescale because tidal marshes have a relatively open N cycle and can accrue soil organic matter rapidly. To determine how elevated CO2 affects N dynamics, we assessed the three primary fates of N in a tidal marsh: (1) retention in plants and soil, (2) denitrification to the atmosphere, and (3) tidal export. We assessed changes in N pools and tracked the fate of a N-15 tracer added to each plot in 2006 to quantify the fraction of added N retained in vegetation and soil, and to estimate lateral N movement. Elevated CO2 alone did not increase plant N mass, soil N mass, or N-15 label retention. Unexpectedly, CO2 and N interacted such that the combined N+CO2 treatment increased ecosystem N accumulation despite the stimulation in N losses indicated by reduced N-15 label retention. These findings suggest that in N-limited ecosystems, elevated CO2 is unlikely to increase long-term N accumulation and circumvent progressive N limitation without additional N inputs, which may relieve plant-microbe competition and allow for increased plant N uptake.

TI  - The contribution of crab burrow excavation to carbon availability in surficial salt-marsh sediments
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphology, vegetation and tidal fluxes are usually identified as the factors introducing variation in the flushing of particulate organic matter (POM) from tidal marshes to adjacent waters. Such variables may, however, be insufficient to explain export characteristics in marshes inhabited by ecosystem engineers that can alter the quantity and quality of POM on the marsh surface that is subject to tidal flushing. In this study we evaluated the balance between transfer of buried sedimentary organic carbon (C) to the marsh surface due to crab excavation (measured from the mounds of sediment excavated from burrows) and outputs of C from the surface due to sediment deposition within crab burrows (estimated from sediment deposited within PVC burrow mimics), in a Southwestern Atlantic salt marsh supporting dense (approximately 70 ind m(-2)) populations of the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus. C excavation by crabs was much greater than deposition of C within crab burrow mimics. Per area unit estimates of the balance between these two processes indicated that crabs excavated 5.98 g m(2) d(-1) and 4.80 mg m(-2) d(-1) of total and readily (10 d) labile C, respectively. However, sediments excavated by crabs showed a significantly lower content of both total and readily-labile C than sediment collected in burrow mimics. This indicates that ecosystem engineering by burrowing crabs causes a net decrease in the concentration of C in the superficial sediment layers and, thus, an overall decrease in the amount of C that can be washed out of the marsh by tidal action. Incorporating the in situ activities of ecosystem engineers in models of marsh export should enhance understanding of the function of marshes in estuarine ecosystems.

TI  - Marsh plants mediate the influence of nitrogen fertilization on degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are commonly exposed to hydrocarbon pollutants derived from extraction disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Naturally occurring microbes can degrade oil, but the rate of oil degradation depends heavily on the key chemical and biological factors. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of interactions between marsh plants and nitrogen (N) on the degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Oil disappearance was measured with gas chromatography (GC) focusing on the change in C-18 n-alkane-to-phytane ratio of oil, and instantaneous oil degradation rates were measured using an instantaneous carbon isotopic partitioning method. N addition often stimulates oil decomposition in soil slurries, but the effect of N in our mesocosms depended on plant species. N addition accelerated oil degradation in Spartina alterniflora mesocosms but slowed oil degradation in Spartina patens mesocosms. Across all plant and N treatments, oil degradation related to plant root growth. In many ecosystems including marshes, N addition has been shown to diminish root growth by reducing the need for nutrient foraging. Where N addition reduces root growth, N may ultimately exacerbate oxygen scarcity in marsh soils possibly negating or reversing the positive, direct effects that N has on oil degradation. Based on these findings, fertilization strategies that maximize marsh plant root growth will be the most effective at increasing the microbial degradation of oil and will have the greatest potential to mitigate the impacts of oil in marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of 3-year air warming on growth of two perennial grasses (Phragmites australis and Imperata cylindrica) in a coastal salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the potential effects of air warming on growth of two perennial grasses (a C-3 species Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and a C-4 species Imperata cylindrica (Linn.) Beauv.) in a coastal salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture. For this purpose, open-top chambers (OTCs) were used with a mean air temperature elevation of approximately 1.5 degrees C on Chongming Island located at the Yangtze Estuary. After 3 years' treatment, a series of growth-related traits of the two species under warming conditions were compared to the same plant materials under the ambient conditions. Regarding P. australis, air warming significantly decreased leaf net photosynthetic rate by 28%, together with leaf area, aboveground biomass and relative growth rate of aboveground biomass by 22%, 28% and 36% at the shoot level, respectively; but it markedly increased specific leaf area by 12% at the shoot level, together with shoot density, leaf area index and aboveground biomass by 142%, 87% and 69% at the population level, respectively. On the other hand, for I. cylindrica, air warming did not significantly change leaf net photosynthetic rate, morphological or growth traits of aboveground part at the shoot level; but it markedly decreased shoot density, leaf area index and aboveground biomass by 49%, 45% and 47% at the population level, respectively. Air warming had no significant effect on rhizome biomass of P. australis down to a depth of 20 cm; but it significantly decreased the rhizome biomass off. cylindrica by 42%. Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature, volumetric moisture or inorganic nitrogen in the upper soil layer; but it markedly increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119%. In an environment with elevated air temperature and warming-increased soil salinity, P. australis enhanced population-level aboveground biomass by increasing shoot density and specific leaf area despite of the decreased leaf photosynthetic rate and shoot-level growth, while the clonal propagation off. cylindrica was suppressed by warming-increased soil salinity and inter-specific competition from P. australis. Our results suggest that P. australis may well maintain the dominance over L cylindrica in the reclaimed salt marsh, when air temperature elevation is within 1.5 degrees C over the next few decades.

TI  - Benthic fluxes in a tidal salt marsh creek affected by fish farm activities: Rio San Pedro (Bay of Cadiz, SW Spain)
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, oxygen, nutrients, nitrous oxide and methane were measured in situ at three sites of Rio San Pedro salt marsh tidal creek (Bay of Cadiz. SW Spain) during three seasons. This system is affected by the discharges of organic carbon and nutrients from the surrounding aquaculture installations. Sediment oxygen uptake rates and inorganic carbon fluxes ranged respectively from 16 to 79 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and from 48 to 146 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Benthic alkalinity fluxes were corrected for the influence of NH4+ and NO3-+NO2- fluxes, and the upper and lower limits for carbon oxidation rates were inferred by considering two possible scenarios: maximum and minimum contribution of CaCO3 dissolution to corrected alkalinity fluxes. Average C-ox. rates were in all cases within 25% of the upper and lower limits and ranged from 40 to 122 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Whereas carbon mineralization did not show significant differences among the sites, C-ox rates varied seasonally and were correlated with temperature (r2=0.72). During winter and spring denitrification was estimated to account for an average loss of 46% and 75%, respectively, of the potentially recyclable N, whereas during the summer no net removal was observed. A possible shift from denitrification to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) during this period is argued. Dissolved CH4 and N2O fluxes ranged from 5.7 to 47 mu mol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 4.3 to 49 mu mol N-N2O m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and represented in all cases a small fraction of total inorganic C and N flux. Overall, about 60% of the total particulate organic matter that is discharged into the creek by the main fish farm facility is estimated to degrade in the sediments, resulting in a significant input of nutrients to the system.

TI  - Tidal effects on ecosystem CO2 exchange at multiple timescales in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tide plays a crucial role in maintaining the carbon sink strength in salt marsh ecosystems. Furthermore, the effects of tides on ecosystem carbon exchange could vary with different timescales. Using the eddy covariance technique combined with wavelet analysis, we analyzed the time-frequency characteristics of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to address the tidal effects on NEE at multiple timescales. The wavelet analysis showed that NEE displayed a tidal-driven pattern with distinct characteristics at the multiday scale (i.e., 8-16 days) and the seasonal scale (i.e., 64-128 days). Moreover, a more significant controlling effect of light rather than air temperature on NEE was found at the diel scale. Tides also affected the variation of the diurnal pattern of NEE. Tidal flooding inhibited nighttime CO2 emissions (NEEnighttime) as well as decreased temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NEEnighttime from 1.37 to 1.16. In contrast, the response of daytime NEE (NEEdaytime) to tidal activities was more complicated, as the NEEdaytime reacted differently with different months during the growing season. Overall, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of tidal effects on ecosystem carbon exchange in salt marshes.

TI  - Land use change assessment in coastal mangrove forests of Iran utilizing satellite imagery and CA-Markov algorithms to monitor and predict future change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest stores large organic carbon stocks in a setting that is highly vulnerable to climate change and direct anthropogenic influences. As such there is a need to elucidate the causes and consequences of land use change on these ecosystems that have high value in terms of ecosystem services. We examine the areal pattern of land types in a coastal region located in southern Iran over a period of 14 years to predict future loss and gain in land types to the year 2025. We applied a CA-Markov model to simulate and predict mangrove forest change. Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze the land cover changes between soil, open water and mangroves. Major changes during this period were observed in soil and water which could be attributed to rising sea level. Furthermore, the mangrove area in the more seaward position was converted to open water due to sea-level rise. A cellular automata model was then used to predict the land cover changes that would occur by the year 2025. Results demonstrated that approximately 21 ha of mangrove area will be converted to open water, while mangroves are projected to expand by approximately 28 ha in landward direction. These changes need to be delineated to better inform precise mitigation and adaptation measures.

TI  - Sea level rise, drought and the decline of Spartina patens in New England marshes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Already heavily impacted by coastal development, estuarine vegetated habitats (seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves) are increasingly affected by climate change via accelerated sea level rise, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation and storms, and warmer ocean temperatures. Conservation of these sensitive and vulnerable habitats requires the recognition of climate change effects so environmental managers can develop and apply appropriate intervention and adaptation strategies where possible. Here we focus on Spartina patens (saltmeadow cordgrass), a foundation species of New England (USA) coastal marshes. A growing, body of evidence suggests this species is disappearing rapidly from wetlands in the region, leading to reductions in habitat quality, plant diversity, carbon sequestration, erosion resistance and coastal protection. We grew S. patens under five inundation and three precipitation regimes, monitored changes in its extent within two Southern New England coastal marshes (2000-2014), and used water level and precipitation data to detect changes in environmental conditions affecting these marshes. Our results suggest that current inundation patterns have reduced the persistence of S. patens, while short-term drought did not appear responsible for vegetation changes or habitat conversion. We conclude that accelerated sea level rise is incompatible with the long-term survival of S. patens within the current landscape footprint of Southern New England's coastal wetlands. We suggest that conservation actions focused on high marsh preservation concentrate on facilitating the process of marsh migration onto uplands by prioritizing buffer conservation, conducting barrier removal and allowing for retreat where feasible.

TI  - Reconciling models and measurements to assess trends in atmospheric mercury deposition
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in atmospheric mercury deposition are used to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations controlling emissions. This analysis can be complicated by seemingly incongruent data from different model runs. model types, and field measurements. Here we present a case study example that describes how to identify trends in regional scale mercury deposition using hest-available information from Multiple data sources. To do this, we use data from three atmospheric chemistry models (CMAQ. GEOS-Chem. HYSPLIT) and Multiple sediment archives (ombrotrophic bog, headwater lake, coastal salt marsh) from the Bay of Fundy region in Canada. Combined sediment and modeling data indicate that deposition attributable to US and Canadian emissions has declined in recent years. thereby increasing the relative significance of global sources. We estimate that anthropogenic emissions in the US and Canada account for 28-33% of contemporary atmospheric deposition in this region. with the rest from natural (14-32%) and global sources (41-53%).

TI  - SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOFTSTEM BULRUSH, SCIRPUS-VALIDUS, ACROSS A SALINITY GRADIENT
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution patterns of Scirpus validus were studied in tidal marshes of the lower Savannah River.  The hypothesis that changes in spatial pattern for S. validus would accompany differences in environmental parameters was tested by sampling densities and biomass along environmental gradients of salinity and elevation.  Coefficients of dispersion were calculated for S. validus and used to compare spatial patterns among freshwater, mildly oligohaline, strongly oligohaline, and mesohaline tidal marshes.  Results indicated significantly greater clumping of S. validus in mesohaline marsh than in freshwater marsh.  Only the mildly oligohaline site supported a random population of S. validus, while the strongly oligohaline marsh supported a uniform spatial distribution.  Spatial pattern and relative importance of S. validus, as well as composition of co-occurring species, changed significantly with changing salinity.  The relations between changes in relative importance of S. validus and differences in soil organic matter and elevation were also significant.

TI  - Factors controlling soil organic carbon stocks in hardwood floodplain forests of the lower middle Elbe River
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed key relationships of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to hydromorphic features, soil texture, C/N ratio, pH, and forest age in hardwood floodplain forests. Floodplain ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, particularly due to their SOC storage potential. Interactions between heterogeneous microrelief and anthropogenically affected vegetation and the hydrologic situation of floodplains make predicting SOC stocks difficult without field validation. Especially within hardwood floodplain forests, the controlling factors for SOC storage remain understudied, whereas these floodplain types can be the largest reservoir for carbon and have a substantial SOC sequestration potential. To determine the controlling factors for SOC storage, we selected 38 hardwood floodplain forest and 11 floodplain grasslands of the lower middle Elbe River and categorized them according to vegetation type (grassland, young forest, or old forest) and hydrologic situation (low-lying or high elevated and active or former floodplain). Profile SOC stocks were determined to a depth of 1 m, and topsoil SOC stocks were related to vegetation and soil characteristics, particularly pedological traits (e.g., hydromorphic features).Forest SOC stocks ranged between 99 and 149 t ha(-1). SOC stocks decreased with depth throughout all categories and were unaffected by vegetation type within the same hydrologic situation. Vegetation parameters such as age, basal area, or leaf litter carbon stock had no direct effect on SOC stocks. An active connection to the river had the strongest effect on SOC stocks, with former floodplain sites storing 33% less SOC than the active sites. Within the active floodplains, low sites stored 50% more SOC than high sites. This effect was mainly controlled by relief-affected features such as flooding duration and fine texture, which also were the strongest univariate predictors for SOC stocks (R-2 = 0.39 and 0.63). A multiple linear regression showed that fine texture, pH, C/N ratio and forest age can be used to explain 86% of variance in SOC stocks.We conclude that proxies for relief and sedimentation (i.e., hydromorphic features, flooding duration, soil texture, C/N ratio, and pH) are the strongest factors controlling SOC stocks in hardwood floodplain forests. Both can be related to allochthonous carbon inputs, increasing SOC stabilization through the accumulation of fine soil particles, and decreasing aerobic carbon mineralization potential through oxygen scarcity, while vegetation plays only a subordinate role.

TI  - Mud-associated organic matter and its direct and indirect role in marsh organic matter accumulation and vertical accretion
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ plant production is often assumed to be the major contributor to organic matter (OM) accumulation and vertical accretion in tidal marshes. Here, we evaluate the contribution of mud-associated OM in salt and brackish marshes in Louisiana. Based on 14 soil cores, the OM content of the mud fraction-i.e., any material smaller than 64 mu m-was 17% +/- 7% for the salt marshes and 28% +/- 14% for the brackish marshes. This remains nearly uniform over the top 35 cm depth, suggesting that this material is deposited contemporaneously with the mud. The dry bulk density of the mud (300-450 kg m(-3)) is also much lower than what was estimated using a previously proposed two-constituent mixing model (1990 kg m(-3)). To reconcile this discrepancy, we developed a modified mixing model that includes mud OM and differentiates sand as a separate constituent with its high dry bulk density. The model estimates that mud contributes to similar to 60% of the total marsh vertical accretion in Louisiana, considerably higher than the similar to 14% estimated with the two-constituent mixing model. The result, which is a direct consequence of the relatively high porosity of mud, highlights that mud deposition is crucial for the accretion of microtidal marshes. Further, the model estimates that the mud OM constitutes similar to 60% of the total soil OM, emphasizing that in situ plant production is not the only-and, in minerogenic marshes, not the major-contributor to OM accumulation.

TI  - Evolution and phosphorus fractionation in saline Spolic Technosols flooded with eutrophic water
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of P in saline Spolic Technosols flooded with eutrophic water, with and without plant rhizosphere, in order to assess the role of these soils as sinks or sources of this nutrient.Samples were taken from basic (pH 7.8), carbonated and acidic (pH 6.2), de-carbonated soils of salt marshes polluted by mine wastes. Three treatments were assayed: pots with Sarcocornia fruticosa, pots with Phragmites australis and pots without plants (bare soil). The pots were flooded for 15 weeks with eutrophic water (PO (4) (3-) 6.92 mg L-1) and pH, Eh and water-soluble organic carbon and PO (4) (3-) concentrations were monitored in the soil solution. A soil P fractionation was applied before and after the flooding period.The PO (4) (3-) concentration in the soil solution decreased rapidly in both soils, with and without plant, being diminished by 80-90 % after 3 h of flooding. The Fe/Mn/Al oxides and the Ca/Mg compounds played an important role in soil P retention. In pots with S. fruticosa, the reductive conditions due to flooding induced P release from metal oxides and P retention to Ca/Mg compounds. In turn, P. australis may have favoured the release of P from carbonates, which was transferred to Fe/Mn/Al compounds.The retention of P by the soil was the main mechanism involved in the removal of PO (4) (3-) from the eutrophic flooding water but to evaluate the capacity of these systems as long-term P sinks, the combined effect of metals, Ca/Mg compounds and specific plant species should be considered.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seven sediment cores (60-80 cm) were collected at Chiricahueto marsh, a salt marsh influenced by agrochemical, domestic and industrial effluents. The concentrations of Ag, Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Pb, V and Zn were studied in the solid phase at each 1-cm section. The profiles of Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn showed a slight recent pollution in the site with enrichment and anthropogenic factors higher than unity; and correlation analysis indicated a direct association with organic carbon. Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Li, and V concentration profiles displayed a negative correlation with organic C and positive with mud content and no consistent enrichment at surface. Based on the principal component analysis and correlation analysis, two principal groups of metals were identified. The first group includes Al, Co, Cr, Fe and Li, that are derived predominantly from the weathering of parent materials in the local bedrock; and the second group include most of the metals, which were relatively enriched at surficial sediments, that are produced mainly by anthropogenic activities such as agriculture (Cd, Cu and Zn), sewage effluents (Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and in lesser extent atmospheric deposition (Cd and Pb).

TI  - Digging into the roots: understanding direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem service trade-offs in coastal grasslands via plant functional traits
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent empirical and theoretical approaches have called for an understanding of the processes underpinning ecosystem service provision. Environmental gradients have shown effects on key plant functional traits that subsequently explain ecosystem properties of several systems. However, little is known concerning how associations between plant functional traits, including both below- and aboveground plant components, predict ecosystem properties and independently measured final ecosystem services. Here, we modeled (1) the responses of the leaf and plant economics spectrum, Plant size axis, and root growth to environmental gradients and (2) how associations between plant functional traits explain trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem properties and final services. Forty-four plots were studied in a coastal marsh landscape of the German North Sea Coast. We used a partial least square structural equation model approach to test the hypothesized model. We found (1) a negative covariation between plant traits pertaining to a size axis and traits explaining both plant growth (roots and stems) and the leaf economics spectrum; (2) this trade-off responded significantly to the land use gradient and nutrient availability, which were both strongly driven by the groundwater gradient; (3) this trade-off explained an initial major trade-off between carbon stocks, at one extreme of the axis, and both the habitat value to conserve endangered plants and forage production for meat and dairy products at the other extreme. However, a secondary trade-off between nature conservation value and forage production, explained by a trade-off between leaf economics spectrum and plant growth in response to the land use intensity gradient, was also found.

TI  - Carbon metabolic rates and GHG emissions in different wetland types of the Ebro Delta
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deltaic wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which characteristically can act as C-sinks. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220-250 g C m(-2) y(-1)), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m(-2) y(-1)). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the 16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions.

TI  - The flux of methyl chloride along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh, Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes have been suggested to be a large potential source for methyl chloride (CH3Cl) that is the major natural carrier of chlorine to the stratosphere. However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

TI  - Modern geochemical evolution of lagoon-marshy landscapes in the western Caspian Sea region
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape-geochemical consequences of the full cycle of Caspian Sea fluctuations (regression-transgression-stabilization) that has taken place in the recent decades are analyzed. The regressive and lagoon-transgressive sets of landscape-geochemical processes (LGPs) are characterized. The impact of the regressive stage on the environment is seen in the development of the regressive LGPs in the soils and sediments of the coastal landscapes with a predominance of salinization and weak humus accumulation. The transgression of the sea was accompanied by the formation of specific lagoon-marsh landscapes, in which the accumulation of sulfides, gleyzation, iron oxidation, and humus formation were clearly pronounced. The general scheme of the evolution of the LGPs within the past 30 years is discussed. The rates of the humus accumulation and salinization during the stabilization stage are estimated. The organic matter reserves in the coastal soils increased by 1.5-2 times in a decade. The transformation of the particular forms of chemical elements in the lagoon-marsh landscapes upon fluctuations in the sea level is shown. The rise in the Caspian sea level was accompanied by the enhanced migration of elements with varying valences, such as Fe and Mn (as well as Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Co) due to their mobilization in the slightly alkaline and neutral reducing conditions and their precipitation at the geochemical barriers.

TI  - Using in situ ultraviolet-visual spectroscopy to measure nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and suspended solids concentrations at a high frequency in a brackish tidal marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of high frequency water quality data are key to making the next leap in hydrological and biogeochemical sciences. Commercially available in situ ultraviolet-visual (UV-Vis) spectrometers make possible the long-term collection of absorption spectra multiple times per hour. This technology has proven useful for measuring nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids in many environments, but has not been tested in tidal marsh conditions where upstream freshwater mixes with estuarine waters, resulting in rapid changes in concentrations and salinity. These three parameters encompass only a portion of the nutrients that are of interest in these systems. To test the potential of spectroscopy to measure these and other nutrient concentrations, spectrometers were installed in a constructed brackish tidal marsh and absorbance spectra were compared to lab analyses for coinciding discrete samples. Variable selection techniques, including partial least squares regression, lasso regression, and stepwise regression, were used to develop models with which nitrate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, phosphate, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, and salinity in brackish marsh waters can be predicted from UV-Vis spectrometer measurements. Significant relationships between the absorption spectra and the laboratory measured concentrations were observed for all of the parameters. Phosphate and total phosphorus were the only nutrients which had R-2 values less than 0.86 for their best calibrations. This study shows the potential to collect multiple water quality parameters at a high frequency in brackish waters using in situ spectrometers and gives the tools to replicate this analysis in all environments.

TI  - The influence of Sarcocornia fruticosa on retention of PAHs in salt marsh sediments (Sado estuary, Portugal)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Depth concentration profiles of PAHs, organic carbon and dissolved oxygen in non-colonised sediments and sediments colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa from Mitrena salt marsh (Sado, Portugal) were determined in November 2004 and April 2005. Belowground biomass and PAH levels in below and aboveground material were also determined. In both periods, colonised sediments were oxygenated until 15-cm, rich in organic carbon (max 4.4%) and presented much higher PAH concentrations (max. 7.1 mu g g(-1)) than non-colonised sediments (max. 0.55 mu g g(-1)). Rooting sediments contained the highest PAH concentrations. The five- and six-ring compounds accounted to 50-75% of the total PAHs in colonised sediments, while only to 30% in non-colonised sediments. The elevated concentrations of PAHs in colonised sediments may be attributed to the transfer of dissolved PAH compounds towards the roots as plant uptake water and subsequent sequestration onto organically rich particles. A phase-partitioning mechanism probably explains the higher retention of the heavier PAHs. In addition oxygenated conditions of the rooting sediments favour the degradation of the lighter PAHs and explain the elevated proportion of the heavier compounds. Below and aboveground materials presented lower PAH concentrations (0.18-0.38 mu g g(-1)) than colonised sediments. Only 3- and 4-PAHs were quantified in aboveground material, reflecting either preferential translocation of lighter compounds from roots or atmospheric deposition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Carbon fluxes, evapotranspiration, and water use efficiency of terrestrial ecosystems in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude, spatial patterns, and controlling factors of the carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems in China are not well understood due to the lack of ecosystem-level flux observations. We synthesized flux and micrometeorological observations from 22 eddy covariance flux sites across China, and examined the carbon fluxes, evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) of terrestrial ecosystems at the annual scale. Our results show that annual carbon and water fluxes exhibited clear latitudinal patterns across sites. Both annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) declined with increasing latitude, leading to a declining pattern in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) with increasing latitude. Annual ET also generally declined with increasing latitude. The spatial patterns of annual carbon and water fluxes were mainly driven by annual temperature, precipitation, and growing season length. Carbon fluxes, ET, and water use efficiency (WUE) varied with vegetation type. Overall, forest and cropland sites had higher annual fluxes than grassland sites, and the annual fluxes of coastal wetland sites were similar to or slightly higher than those of forest sites. Annual WUE was associated with annual precipitation, GPP, and growing season length. Higher-productivity ecosystems (forests and coastal wetlands) also had higher WUE than lower-productivity ecosystems (grasslands and croplands). The strong relationships between annual GPP and ET demonstrated the coupling of the carbon and water cycles. Our results show that forest plantations had high annual NEP and WUE, and could provide larger carbon sequestration capacity than natural forests. The coastal salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems also had high carbon sequestration capacity. Efforts to strengthen China's terrestrial carbon sink should focus on ecosystems such as forest plantations in southern China where heat and water are ideal for maintaining high productivity. This strategy is especially important because efforts to increase carbon sequestration in areas of limited water may inadvertently contribute to the ongoing water crisis in northern China.

TI  - Spatial distribution and morphological responses to predation in the salt marsh periwinkle
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) is a common and often abundant mollusk in marshes of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States. Several studies have focused on the effects of periwinkles on Spartina alterniflora production and the effects of oil on periwinkle survivability, yet the general ecology of the snail has been underreported. In this study, we measured spatial distributions, biomass, shell repair frequency, and a suite of morphological characteristics of L. irrorata at three sites in each of five regions spanning the southeastern Louisiana Coast between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi rivers. Sampling was conducted along 50 m edge-to-interior transects in S. alterniflora-dominated marshes. We found that L. irrorata density, individual biomass, and total areal biomass significantly varied by region. Each also significantly varied with distance from the marsh edge, with the exception of total periwinkle areal biomass. We saw a general trend across most regions where periwinkle density tended to be greatest 10 m from the marsh edge and biomass tended to be greatest 20-30 m from the marsh edge; however, neither periwinkle density nor biomass was related to S. alterniflora density or stem height. The allometric relationship between shell length and biomass varied significantly between all regions, indicating that this species has differing regional growth patterns. A possible driver of these regional patterns in allometry is differences in predation pressures, with increased predation scaring at Port Fourchon sites corresponding to snails with larger shells yet less internal biomass per length compared to other regions. This study provides the first large-scale description of the spatial ecology and regional morphometry of the salt marsh periwinkle, an important organism in structuring salt marsh ecosystems, and suggests that the pressures exerted by L. irrorata on plant production found in other studies likely varies by geography and spatial location within a marsh.

TI  - Long-term nutrient addition increases respiration and nitrous oxide emissions in a New England salt marsh
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes may act either as greenhouse gas (GHG) sources or sinks depending on hydrological conditions, vegetation communities, and nutrient availability. In recent decades, eutrophication has emerged as a major driver of change in salt marsh ecosystems. An ongoing fertilization experiment at the Great Sippewissett Marsh (Cape Cod, USA) allows for observation of the results of over four decades of nutrient addition. Here, nutrient enrichment stimulated changes to vegetation communities that, over time, have resulted in increased elevation of the marsh platform. In this study, we measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in dominant vegetation zones along elevation gradients of chronically fertilized (1,572kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and unfertilized (12kgNha(-1)year(-1)) experimental plots at Great Sippewissett Marsh. Flux measurements were performed using darkened chambers to focus on community respiration and excluded photosynthetic CO2 uptake. We hypothesized that N-replete conditions in fertilized plots would result in larger N2O emissions relative to control plots and that higher elevations caused by nutrient enrichment would support increased CO2 and N2O and decreased CH4 emissions due to the potential for more oxygen diffusion into sediment. Patterns of GHG emission supported our hypotheses. Fertilized plots were substantially larger sources of N2O and had higher community respiration rates relative to control plots, due to large emissions of these GHGs at higher elevations. While CH4 emissions displayed a negative relationship with elevation, they were generally small across elevation gradients and nutrient enrichment treatments. Our results demonstrate that at decadal scales, vegetation community shifts and associated elevation changes driven by chronic eutrophication affect GHG emission from salt marshes. Results demonstrate the necessity of long-term fertilization experiments to understand impacts of eutrophication on ecosystem function and have implications for how chronic eutrophication may impact the role that salt marshes play in sequestering C and N.

TI  - Do fish communities function as biotic vectors of organic matter between salt marshes and marine coastal waters?
T2  - Aquatic Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of fish communities to organic matter (OM) fluxes, especially between salt marshes and adjacent marine coastal waters are reviewed. For this a data set from the bay of Mont Saint-Michel and literature is examined and discussed. In a range of macro-tidal coasts of Europe, salt marshes are only flooded at spring tides for a short time. Many animals, including fish, then invade the salt marshes through tidal creeks. They forage there for up to a few hours and swim back to sea at ebb. Meanwhile, organic matter is exported as gut content. In the 4000 ha of salt marshes of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel mullets were responsible for the export of about 8 kg of dry weight OM ha-1 in 1996 and of roughly 12 kg in 1997. Although spatio-temporally variable, the fish communities appear to play a more or less significant role, as 'biotic vectors' in the nutrient fluxes between salt marshes and coastal waters.

TI  - Changes in soil organic carbon dynamics in an Eastern Chinese coastal wetland following invasion by a C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic C-4 grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to tidal coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province of China in 1982. Since then it has rapidly replaced the native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa, becoming one of the dominant vegetation types in the coastal wetlands of China. Although plant invasion can change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, little is known about how plant invasion influences C storage within soil fractions. We investigated how S. altemiflora invasion across an 8, 12 and 14-year chronosequence affected SOC and soil nitrogen (N), using soil fractionation and stable delta C-13 isotope analyses. SOC and N concentrations at 0-10 cm depth in S. altemiflora soil increased during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence, ranging from 3.67 to 4.90 g C kg(-1) soil, and from 0.307 to 0.391 g N kg(-1) soil. These were significantly higher than the values in the Suaeda salsa community, by 27.0-69.6% for SOC. and 21.8-55.2% for total N. The S. alterniflora-derived SOC varied from 0.40 to 0.92 g C kg(-1) according to mixing calculations, assuming the two possible SOC sources of S. alterniflora and S. salsa, and accounted for 10.8-18.7% of total SOC in the colonized soils. The estimated accumulative rate of SOC from C-4 (S. alterniflora) was 64.1 C kg(-1) soil year(-1) and from C-3 sources was 78.1 mg C kg(-1). The concentration of S. alterniflora-derived SOC significantly decreased from coarse fraction to fine fraction, and linearly increased as the period of S. alterniflora invasion increased. The highest accumulative rate of SOC from a C-4 source occurred in macroaggregates, while the highest rate from C-3 was in microaggregates. The storage of SOC derived from S. alterniflora in the macroaggregates was 0.27-0.44 g C kg(-1) soil, accounting for 43.1-49.1% of the total C(4)derived SOC in the soil. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion in coastal wetlands could facilitate SOC storage, because of the high potential for accumulation of the C which has been newly derived from S. alterniflora litter and roots.

T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Continuous monitoring data reported are a portion of data from a larger study investigating changes in soil properties, carbon accumulation, and greenhouse gas fluxes in four recently restored salt marsh sites and nearby natural salt marshes. For several decades, local towns, conservation groups, and government organizations have worked to identify, replace, repair, and enlarge culverts to restore tidal flow upstream from historical tidal restrictions in an effort to restore salt marsh ecosystems on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Undersized or failed culverts restrict tidal exchange between the marsh and the bays and estuaries, which leads to alterations in plant community composition and in fundamental processes controlling soil carbon accumulation, soil carbon transformations, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, sites were selected to compare salt marshes restored over a range of years and to compare marshes upstream and downstream from a restored tidal restriction. Salt marshes downstream from tidal restrictions represent "natural" conditions because hydrology was not substantially altered, whereas marshes upstream from repaired culverts represent "restored" conditions. At each of the four salt marsh sites, study plots were established on the natural and restored sides of the former tidal restriction. Well water-level loggers, soil and air temperature loggers, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensors were deployed over the growing season to coincide with discrete measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes made by study collaborators. Water-level loggers were also deployed in creeks near the restored tidal restriction.

TI  - High Colonization Possibility of Some Species of Weeds in Suaeda salsa Community: From an Ecological Stoichiometry Perspective
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa community is a vegetation type in saline-alkali areas. Weed invasion and colonization in S. salsa communities lead to fragmentationsof S. salsa communities. The colonization of invaded weeds in S. salsa communities is related to community succession of saline-alkali zones. The fragmented S. salsa community may be restored if the mechanism of invaded weed colonization in S. salsa communities is clearly elucidated. Thus, we studied the ecological stoichiometric characteristics of soils and plants in a salt marsh to explain the high colonization possibility of invaded weeds in S. salsa communities. In October 2014, soils and plants were collected from Dongfeng Salt Marsh, Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China. The ratio of Ex-N/Ex-P in soil was less than 13, which suggests a relative nitrogen limitation for the primary production in the zone. The minimum phosphorus content in plants was higher than 1 mg g(-1), whereas the maximum nitrogen content in plants was less than 13 mg g(-1). These results imply that phosphorus was abundant, whereas nitrogen was deficient in the area. The plants in the salt marsh may be limited by nitrogen. Given the relatively lower nitrogen contents in Cyperus glomeratus, Echinochloa crusgalli, and Aster subulatus than that in S. salsa, these three species exhibited higher competitiveness than S. salsa did when nitrogen was limited in primary production. These weed species may colonize highly in S. salsa communities. Moreover, nitrogen fertilization might be effective to maintain S. salsa community in Dongfeng Salt Marsh, whereas its effects on controlling weeds colonization in S. salsa communities need more studies to verify.

TI  - Plant manipulations and diel cycle measurements test drivers of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a Phragmites australis-invaded coastal marsh
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion of coastal marshes by Phragmites australis may alter carbon cycling, including fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Understanding patterns and drivers of these GHG fluxes in P. australis-invaded coastal marshes is critical to predicting how this widespread biological invasion may impact carbon (C) sequestration in coastal marshes. The objectives of this study were (1) to test effects of P. australis aboveground vegetation removal on GHG fluxes over short timescales (up to 4 months) and (2) to contrast diel patterns of GHG fluxes in P. australis-vegetated and cleared plots. First, effects of mechanical aboveground P. australis biomass removal on GHG fluxes and soil variables were tested over a series of short-term durations (from min to months). Next, on 3 dates, GHG fluxes were measured every 3 h over complete diel cycles. Net daytime CO2 uptake (-60 to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was observed where P. australis was left intact. All durations of vegetation removal produced similar CO2 emissions to those measured from intact P. australis plots during evening hours. CH4 fluxes did not differ where P. australis was removed or left intact. Greater daytime CH4 emissions (75-100 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were found than at night (20-40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) from both cleared and vegetated plots. Results of this study suggest that CO2 fluxes in this system vary primarily due to substantial photosynthetic uptake by P. australis, and that CH4 emissions are likely driven by abiotic factors, such as temperature, that vary on diel cycles. Calculation of net GHG fluxes in this P. australis-invaded coastal marsh indicates that it is a GHG sink during the growing season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation Zonation Predicts Soil Carbon Mineralization and Microbial Communities in Southern New England Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes are important blue carbon reservoirs, but it is unclear how vegetation shifts associated with tidal restoration and sea level rise alter soil microbial respiration rates and bacterial community composition. Within 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 without tidal restrictions, 10 tidally restored), we sampled three vegetation zones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phragmites australis to estimate microbial respiration rates (SIR, substrate-induced respiration; carbon mineralization), root zone bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and a suite of plant and soil characteristics. Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.

TI  - Passive experimental warming decouples air and sediment temperatures in a salt marsh
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open top chambers (OTCs) are a commonly used passive warming technique in experimental warming studies. OTCs have been shown to be effective in multiple types of terrestrial systems, but their utility in wetland environments remains uncertain. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of using OTCs to warm a temperate salt marsh across diurnal and seasonal cycles. We found that OTCs are effective at warming air temperatures on the marsh, with average air temperatures 1.6 +/- 0.007 degrees C and 1.1 +/- 0.006 degrees C warmer within the high and low marsh, respectively over a 16-month period. In contrast, OTCs were ineffective at warming sediments, especially during the day. In fact, sediment temperatures within the OTC were cooler during the day relative to ambient conditions. Such daytime warming of air, but cooling of sediments relative to ambient conditions resulted in a significant decoupling of above and belowground temperatures in the marsh (r = -0.99 and -0.82 on low and high marsh, respectively). Our data indicate that shading by OTCs was responsible for the daytime sediment cooling relative to ambient conditions during most of the year, as incoming solar radiation was reduced by 30% within OTCs. Wet sediments require more energy to heat than the air due to their higher specific heat capacity. Thus, reductions in radiation by OTCs prevented effective warming of sediments, but still allowed for the warming of air. In turn, we conclude that OTCs are not an effective method to experimentally warm tidal marsh sediments.

TI  - How vegetation influence the macrobenthos distribution in different saltmarsh zones along coastal topographic gradients
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrobenthos are a key constituent of coastal salt marsh ecosystems and have often been used as sensitive indicators of the environment quality. In this study, field investigations in vegetated regions and adjacent bare patches of low, middle and high marshes were conducted to explore whether and how vegetation influence the macrobenthos distribution in different saltmarsh zones along coastal topographic gradients. Results showed that vegetation positively or negatively influenced macrobenthos mainly by changing their environment in different saltmarsh zones, as there were different degrees of physical stresses and food supply for the macrobenthos from the low to the high marsh. In the low marsh, no major differences in macrobenthos indices between the bare and vegetated sediments were found, yet density and biomass of the molluscs were higher in the bare patches. In the middle marsh, vegetation promoted the biomass and diversity indices but not the density and species richness of the macrobenthos, and vegetation was beneficial for some types of crustaceans but was detrimental for some types of polychaetes. In the high marsh, vegetation promoted the biomass, density, and species richness of the macrobenthos compared to those of adjacent bare patches. Coastal topographic gradients also had effects on macrobenthos distribution consistently with different habitat preferences and ecological niches, and the low marsh had the highest species richness, Shannon diversity, Pielou evenness and Margalef richness. This study also provided scientific implications for the management and restoration of the ecosystems in different intertidal saltmarsh zones.
