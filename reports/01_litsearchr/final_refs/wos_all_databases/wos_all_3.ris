TI  - Limited effects of nutrient enrichment on bacterial carbon sources in salt marsh tidal creek sediments
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacteria influence carbon cycling in coastal sediments by decomposing the organic matter produced in situ as well as that delivered from the landscape and neighboring ecosystems. Disturbances, such as eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus (August) and traced into lipids representing benthic microalgae (BMA) and bacteria. Bacteria assimilated C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora at similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly transferred to BMA, likely via bacterial respiration. Overall, nutrient enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments. Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen enrichment effects were limited as well as provide a mechanism for retaining newly fixed and detrital carbon in coastal sediments.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Blue Carbon Ecosystems: Mangroves, Seagrasses and Salt Marshes during 2010-2018
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.

TI  - Saltwater encroachment and prediction of future ecosystem response to the Anthropocene Marine Transgression, Southeast Saline Everglades, Florida
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Separating the effects of anthropogenic changes in freshwater delivery from that of sea level rise on the rate of salt water encroachment in the low relief Southeast Saline Everglades is important for understanding how the Anthropocene Marine Transgression might be best managed. We use stratigraphic and paleoecologic methods to calculate rates of salt water encroachment and biogenic sediment accumulation in the Southeast Saline Everglades. Our results suggest that sea level rise during the last century was accompanied by salt water encroachment, which is ultimately controlled by the elevation of high tide and varied by a factor of 14.8 in the five watersheds studied. These differences are attributed primarily to differences in freshwater delivery. The delivery of freshwater mitigated salt water encroachment in only one of the five watersheds. This difference is attributed to sufficient freshwater delivery to maintain a plant community with more rapid rate of sediment accumulation than other sites. Under conditions of diminishing freshwater availability and increasing rate of sea level rise, our data suggest that little can be done at a scale large enough to prevent loss of the Southeast Saline Everglades within the next 50-200 years.

TI  - Fluorescence characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in shallow water along the Zhejiang coasts, southeast China
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-eight surface water samples from rivers, muddy intertidal flats, sand shores, and bedrock coasts were collected along the Zhejiang coastline in southeast China. In addition, three samples from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) were collected for comparison. CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter) absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, as well as nutrients and DOC were measured in these samples. According to salinity, nutrient, and DOC constituents, the 28 Zhejiang samples were categorized into four groups, i.e. highly-polluted, river derived, muddy-flat derived, and saltwater dominated ones. Among the six parameters (two humic-like and two protein-like peak intensities in fluorescence EEM contours, absorption at 300 nm, and DOC concentration) for the Zhejiang samples, any two of them were positively correlated. The submarine groundwater discharge, rather than local rivers, might have provided most of the freshwater that interacted with the saltwater during the mixing process. The high protein-like EEM peaks in samples from muddy salt marshes and rivers were probably caused by terrestrial inputs, land-based pollution, and local biological activities in combination.

TI  - Expert-Based Evaluation of Ecosystem Service Provision in Coastal Reed Wetlands Under Different Management Regimes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A characteristic feature of lagoons and estuaries along the Baltic Sea is the dominance of reed (Phragmites australis) along their coasts. Reed wetlands are ecologically valuable ecosystems and play an important role for nutrient and matter cycling as well as for biodiversity. They provide a broad spectrum of ecosystem services and have been utilized by humans already for centuries. We assess the ecosystem service provision of reed wetlands and analyze how this is affected by different management scenarios and how the results of an expert-based ecosystem service assessment can be used in practice. Because of strong internal gradients and interactions with the surrounding, coastal reed belts show a higher ecosystem service provision compared to homogeneous inland reed. The three different coastal management scenarios are (1) winter harvest of reed, (2) summer harvest of reed, and (3) grazing by livestock. According to the views of 18 involved experts from Lithuania, Poland, and Germany, winter harvest is regarded as the scenario with the lowest conflict potential between nature protection and reed utilization. Experts expect no changes or even slight increases for regulating and cultural services. However, experts see the need to establish a sustainable and regionally anchored winter harvest concept. Summer harvest and grazing entail the risk to change the ecosystem structure and could lead to a shift in vegetation pattern toward short salt marsh grassland. Experts expect a slight decrease in regulating services. In particular, erosion control, biodiversity, and nutrient sequestration are rated controversially. To our experience, these expert-based ecosystem service assessments can support policy implementation (e.g., NATURA 2000, European Water Framework Directive or Marine Strategy Framework Directive). It can serve as a tool that allows stakeholders to visualize trade-offs, analyze patterns and processes at regional scales, and hence facilitate decision-making.

TI  - Soil microbial community development across a 32-year coastal wetland restoration time series and the relative importance of environmental factors.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystem functioning through processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling, and regulating vegetation structure and productivity. Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.

TI  - Dissolved Organic Matter Characteristics Across a Subtropical Wetland's Landscape: Application of Optical Properties in the Assessment of Environmental Dynamics
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are known to be important sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to rivers and coastal environments. However, the environmental dynamics of DOM within wetlands have not been well documented on large spatial scales. To better assess DOM dynamics within large wetlands, we determined high resolution spatial distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) in a subtropical freshwater wetland, the Everglades, Florida, USA. DOC concentrations decreased from north to south along the general water flow path and were linearly correlated with chloride concentration, a tracer of water derived from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), suggesting that agricultural activities are directly or indirectly a major source of DOM in the Everglades. The optical properties of DOM, however, also changed successively along the water flow path from high molecular weight, peat-soil and highly oxidized agricultural soil-derived DOM to the north, to lower molecular weight, biologically produced DOM to the south. These results suggest that even though DOC concentration seems to be distributed conservatively, DOM sources and diagenetic processing can be dynamic throughout wetland landscapes. As such, EEM-PARAFAC clearly revealed that humic-enriched DOM from the EAA is gradually replaced by microbial- and plant-derived DOM along the general water flow path, while additional humic-like contributions are added from marsh soils. Results presented here indicate that both hydrology and primary productivity are important drivers controlling DOM dynamics in large wetlands. The biogeochemical processes controlling the DOM composition are complex and merit further investigation.

TI  - Significant alterations in soil fungal communities along a chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora invasion in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasion typically alters the microbial communities of soils, which affects ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. The responses of the soil fungal communities to plant invasion along its chronosequence remain poorly understood. For this study, we investigated variations in soil fungal communities through Illumina MiSeq sequencing analyses of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), along a chronosequence (i.e., 9-, 13-, 20- and 23-year-old) of invasive Spartina alterniflora. We compared these variations with those of bare flat in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland. Our results highlighted that the abundance of soil fungi, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), species richness, and Shannon diversity indices for soil fungal communities were highest in 9-year-old S. alterniflora soil, which gradually declined along the invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of copiotrophic Basidiomycota revealed significant decreasing trend, while the relative abundance of oligotrophic Ascomycota gradually increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of soil saprotrophic fungi (e.g., undefined saprotrophs) was gradually reduced while symbiotic fungi (e.g., ectomycorrhizal fungi) and pathotrophic fungi (e.g., plant and animal pathogens) progressively increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. Our results suggested that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil fungal abundance and diversity, community composition, trophic modes, and functional groups along a chronosequence, via substantially reduced soil litter inputs, and gradually decreased soil pH, moisture, and soil nutrient substrates along the invasion chronosequence, from 9 to 23 years. These changes in soil fungal communities, particularly their trophic modes and functional groups along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence could well impact the decomposition and accumulation of soil C and N. while potentially altering ecosystem C and N sinks in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland.

AB  - High salinity levels have long been recognized as an important environmental factor influencing plant growth and performance. Salt stress and concomitant water stress are likely to affect photosynthesis by reductions in stomatal conductance necessary to prevent loss of water vapor. Despite inundation with saline water, salt marsh communities exhibit high primary productivity. This study tested the effects of 0 to 40 parts per thousand salinity on leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)), and leaf conductance to CO2 (g(CO2)) in the emergent estuarine C-4 grasses Spartina alterniflora, S. anglica, and S. patens. A increased with increasing salinity in greenhouse and growth chamber experiments. g, and gCO(2) peaked at moderate salinity levels (10 to 20 parts per thousand) but significantly decreased at higher salinities in all species.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured in the surf zone at 13 bathing beaches in Southern California, USA. Summer dry season concentrations averaged 122 +/- 38 nM with beaches with tide pools having lower levels (50-90 nM). No significant differences were observed for ebb waters at a salt marsh outlet vs. a beach (179 +/- 20 vs. 163 +/- 26 nM), and between ebb and flood tides at one site (171 +/- 24 vs. 146 +/- 42 nM). H2O2 levels showed little annual variation. Diel cycling was followed over short (30 min; 24 h study) and long (d) time scales, with maximum afternoon concentration = 370 nM and estimated photochemical production rate of 44 nM h(-1). There was no correlation between the absorbance coefficient at 300 nm (used as a measure of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) levels) and H2O2. H2O2 concentrations measured in this study are likely sufficient to inhibit fecal indicator bacteria in marine recreational waters through indirect photoinactivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dataset: Carbon sequestration and sediment accretion in San Francisco Bay tidal wetlands
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Tidal wetlands play an important role with respect to climate change because of both their sensitivity to sea-level rise and their ability to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Policy-based interest in carbon sequestration has increased recently, and wetland restoration projects have potential for carbon credits through soil carbon sequestration. We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using 137Cs and 210Pb downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0.2 - 0.5 cm year -1 , indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on 210Pb dating was 79 g C m -2  year -1 , with slightly higher rates based on 137Cs dating. There was little difference in the sequestration rates among sites or across stations within sites, indicating that a single carbon sequestration rate could be used for crediting tidal wetland restoration projects within the Estuary.

TI  - Impact of sampling methods on sulfate reduction rates and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in vegetated salt marsh sediments.
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of sediment coring on measured rates of sulfate reduction (SRR) by the whole core 35S-injection technique was assessed in marsh sediment vegetated by Spartina anglica. Simultaneously, the role of extraction method (centrifugation vs. sippers) for determination of porewater DOC in vegetated sediment was evaluated. SRR was measured in situ with radiotracer injected directly into the sediment and in a time series from 1 to 24 h after coring. SRR incubations carried out within 6 h (June) or 12 h (August) of coring yielded up to an order of magnitude higher rates than measured in situ. The enhancement of SRR was instantaneous but temporary and correlated with measured porewater DOC concentrations. Cores sampled from rooted sediments should therefore not be used for sulfate reduction incubations within the first 12 h due to the effect of DOC leaching from roots cut during the coring procedure. The labile fraction of leached DOC appears to be exhausted after a pre-incubation period of at least 12 h. Measurement of porewater DOC is also problematic in vegetated sediment. Porewater extraction by centrifugation of sediment may result in up to one order of magnitude higher DOC concentrations than in porewater obtained by a nondestructive sipper technique. DOC is probably forced out of roots during centrifugation resulting in erroneously high porewater DOC concentrations.

TI  - Biogeomorphological disturbance regimes: progress in linking ecological and geornorphological systems
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the complex, non-linear ways in which linked ecological and geomorphological systems respond to disturbance is important to improving both theoretical understanding and practical environmental management. Some simple conceptual models have been proposed to describe biogeomorphological responses to disturbance within fluvial and aeolian environments, and are reviewed here. Recent research on the interactions between ecological and geomorphological processes in rock breakdown, aeolian, hillslope, fluvial and coastal wetland process regimes indicates a number of additional factors which need to be considered by such models in order to provide a more realistic representation. In particular, many empirical studies point to complex interactions between vegetation, microphytic crusts and animal action (bioturbation and grazing) in a wide range of sediment systems, which act as intrinsic feedback factors complicating the response of these systems to disturbances such as climate change and human action. Improved understanding of these interactions will help effective environmental management, as exemplified by salt marsh restoration schemes. Furthermore, better specification of biogeomorphological interactions can provide insights into large-scale, long-term Earth systems dynamics problems such as the long-term carbon cycle.

TI  - Influence of macrophytes on sediment phosphorus accumulation in a eutrophic estuary (Palmones River, Southern Spain)
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estuary of the Palmones River is a small, shallow and eutrophic system, located in the South of Spain. Presently, it is dominated by the fast-growing macroalgae Ulva rotundata Bliding and Enteromorpha prolifera J.G. Agardh, which respond efficiently to extreme nutrient input. The influence of macrophytes on phosphorus accumulation in sediment, over a long time-scale, was studied in this work. Different fractions of bound phosphorus were measured in four types of sediment: bare sediment (acting as control), sediment with Ulva, sediment with Enteromorpha, and sediment with Sarcocornia perennis perennis (L.) A.J. Scott, a chenopodiacean living on the border of the salt marsh. The results show that ulvaceans favour phosphorus storage in the sediment, throughout the settling of easily degradable organic matter and the subsequent retention of the phosphate being released from the sediment.

TI  - Polychaete community in mangrove and salt marsh in Zhangjiang River Estuary, Fujian Province of East China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the community structure of polychaete in different botanic habitats in Zhangjiang River Estuary, an investigation was conducted in the habitats of Kandelia Candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Spartina alterniflora, and Avicennia marina in four seasons, 2010. A total of 15 polychaete species were recorded, and 6 species including Eteone delta, Namalycastis abiuma, Paraleonnates uschakovi, Polydora ciliata, Capitella capitata, and Mediomastus californiensis were found in the four habitats and four seasons. The density, biomass, richness index, evenness index, and diversity index of the polychaete had no significant differences among seasons but significant differences among habitats, and the dominant species of polychaete in S. alterniflora habitat differed from that in the other three mangrove habitats. Pearson correlation analysis showed that in the mangrove and slat marsh, there were no significant correlations between the polychaete parameters (density, biomass, richness index, evenness index, and diversity index) and the environmental factors (sediment temperature, salinity, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen), except that the species number of polychaete had significant correlation with sediment temperature due to the common species of polychaete such as Capitella capitata, Mediomastus californiensis, and Namalycastis abiuma in the mangrove and salt marsh in Zhangjiang River Estuary being of eurytherm and eurysalinity, and resistant to high organic matter content.

TI  - A 5000 year record of carbon sequestration from a coastal lagoon and wetland complex, Southern California, USA
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands have the potential to accumulate C at high rates over long time periods because they continuously accrete and bury organic-rich sediments, giving soils in coastal wetlands a distinct advantage over many other environments in the sequestration of organic C. Given that coastal wetlands are being lost worldwide, it is important to understand their C sequestration potential. Sediments in a southern California, USA coastal lagoon-wetland complex were cored, and depositional environments were interpreted. Suitable materials were radiocarbon dated. Bulk density and organic C were grouped by depositional environments, and average mass of C per unit volume and C accumulation rates in each depositional environment were calculated. The total organic C sequestered and rates of sequestration in each depositional environment were in the following order from most (fastest) to least (slowest): lagoon, intertidal, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, aeolian. This study demonstrated that high levels of organic C are sequestered per unit volume of sediment (35.9 +/- 3.2 kg m(-3)), and the mean rate of C accumulation was high (0.033 +/- 0.0029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)) over a long time period (5000 years). Results of this study strongly demonstrate the importance and necessary high priority for preserving and restoring coastal wetlands both in the USA and internationally. However, despite their excellent potential to sequester C, significant losses of coastal wetlands are occurring in the United States and elsewhere in the world. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MANGROVE SPECIES, AEGICERAS CORNICULATUM (L.) BLANCO OF PAKISTAN WITH REFERENCE TO PROPAGULE, SAPLING AND SAPLING LEAF
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - Some observations on propagular-size, sapling growth in tidal marsh and macro- and micromorphology of sapling leaves of a true mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco grown in a coastal nursery by planting propagules in tidal marsh of Shah Bunder, Indus delta, are described. Growth included such parameters as net growth (between top of propagule to the end of shoot), number of leaves per sapling, number of internodes in new growth, and photosynthetic area of the sapling. There were crystals containing cells in cortical cells. Spherocrystals and cystoliths also occurred in the cortical cells. In addition to the internal structure of leaves, the morphometric and architectural parameters such as leaf length (LL) and breadth (LB), leaf area measured graphically (LAM), apex and basal angles and aspect ratio (LB / LL) were determined. Lamina area was determined arithmetically using multiplying coefficient K (determined for this species to be 0.6573) for equation, Leaf area = K (LL x LB) and also statistically by developing regression equations for simple (linear and power models) and multiple correlation and regression. Surface micromorphological studies were undertaken with respect to the stomatal types, their density and occurrence of cork warts. On the basis of Dilcher's (1974) stomatal classificatory scheme, paracytic, brachyparacytic, anisocytic and cyclocytic arrangement of subsidiaries was recorded. Subsidiaries distinct and raised in form of ring around the guard cells. Anticlinal walls of epidermal cells were straight to somewhat curvy. Stomatal density averaged to 96.37 +/- 1.275 stomata per mm(2) and stomatal size averaged to 38.36 +/- 0.873 X 11.94 +/- 0.267 mu m. The results are discussed with respect to the available literature.

TI  - Molecular Composition of Humic Acids from Coastal Wetland Soils along a Salinity Gradient
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Humic acids (HAs) play an important role in regulating the biogeochemistry of soils and sediments. The chemical structural composition of humic substances in wetland soils especially at coastal zone, which is subjected to the influence of seawater intrusion, is not yet fully understood. In this study, HAs from soils of three wetland ecosystems along a salinity gradient namely, a forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM), from the Barataria basin of the Louisiana coast were isolated and characterized using elemental analysis, 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with or without tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) treatment. Humic acids from the FS soil, the most inland of the three, showed the most aliphatic nature whereas HAs of the FM soil had the highest percentage of aromatics. There was a general increase in the crystalline domain of alkyl C in these wetland soil HAs along the salinity gradient. The Py-GC/MS TMAH thermochemolysis clearly showed a shift of lignin residues from the dominance of guaiacyl (G-type) and syringyl (S-type) structural units in FS HAs to p-hydroxyphenyl (H-type) structural unit in HAs of both marsh soils. In addition, there was a smaller Syringyl/Guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in the HAs of SM soil than FM soil, and an increasing contribution of sulfur compounds into their HA structural component as moving toward the coast, suggesting the formation of increasingly more recalcitrant nature of HAs along the salinity gradient in these wetlands. The C-13 NMR observation was, in general, consistent with the Py-GC/MS characterization. Overall, the result reveals a clear effect of salinity and vegetation on the molecular composition of HAs.

TI  - Production sources and food web structure of a temperate tidal estuary: integration of dietary and stable isotope data
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Food web structure and major sources of primary production consumed by metafauna of Mad Island Marsh, a coastal saltmarsh on the NW coast of the Gulf of Mexico, were compared using stable isotopes and dietary analysis. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data were entered into a mixing model containing 5 potential production sources. Results were inconclusive due to overlapping isotopic signatures of certain sources, but nonetheless indicated that most fishes and macroinvertebrates assimilated material derived mostly from variable mixtures of macrophytes and filamentous algae. Highest estimates of percentage of material assimilated directly or indirectly from C-4 marsh grasses (ranging from 30 to 82 %) were for spot Leiostomus xanthurus and Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis. Isotopic analysis could not reveal the detailed structure of predator-prey interactions at the species level; greater detail of trophic pathways was revealed by the dietary analysis. Estimates of vertical web structure (species trophic levels) by the 2 methods were largely concordant. The exceptions were 2 zooplanktivorous and detritivorous fish species and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio that had higher trophic levels according to nitrogen isotope ratios. For these taxa, the isotopic method more accurately indexed the number of trophic transfers than the dietary method, which depends on accurate dietary estimation for all food chain components leading to a consumer, and which assumes equal assimilation efficiencies for items found in stomach contents. The isotopic method underestimated trophic levels of several invertebrates, possibly due to inaccurate estimation of mean delta N-15 for production sources supporting these taxa and/or differential trophic fractionation. Together, stable isotope and dietary analyses provide a more accurate assessment of food web structure and dynamics of coastal marsh ecosystems than either method alone.

TI  - Seasonal variation of extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) and its influence on metal speciation in a polluted salt marsh
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of salt marsh sediment extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) on metal fractions and organic matter cycling was evaluated on a seasonal basis. in order to study the relation between organic matter cycles and the associated metal species. Metals in the rhizosediment of Halimione portulacoides were fractioned according to the Tessier's scheme and showed a similar pattern regarding the organic-bound fraction, being always high in Autumn, matching the season when organic matter presented higher values. Both organic-bound and residual fractions were always dominant, being the seasonal variations due to interchanges between these two fractions. Phenol oxidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase had higher activities during the Spring and Summer, contrarily to peroxidase which had higher activity during Winter. Protease showed high activities in both Spring and Winter. These different periods of high organic matter hydrolysis caused two periods of organic metal bound decrease. Sulphatase peaks (Spring and Winter) matched the depletion of exchangeable metal forms, probably due to sulphides formation and consequent mobilization. This showed an interaction between several microbial activities affecting metal speciation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Primary producers sustaining macro-invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to the large number of studies on the trophic significance of mangrove primary production to the aquatic foodweb, there have been few attempts to provide an overview of the relative importance of different primary carbon sources to invertebrates in the intertidal mangrove habitats. We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) in sediments, primary producers, and invertebrate species from an intertidal mangrove forest located along the southeast coast of India in order to determine the contribution of mangrove leaf litter and other carbon sources to the invertebrate community. Organic matter in sediments under the mangrove vegetation was characterized by relatively high delta(13)C values and low C:N ratios, indicating that mangrove-derived organic matter was not the principal source and that imported phytodetritus from the mangrove creeks and adjacent bay significantly contributed to the sediment organic matter pool. Invertebrates were found to display a wide range of delta(13)C values, most being 3-11parts per thousand enriched relative to the average mangrove leaf signal. The pulmonate gastropod Onchidium sp. showed unusually low delta(15)N values (-5.6+/-0.9parts per thousand), but further work is needed to adequately explain these data. A compilation of stable isotope data from various sources indicates that significant assimilation of mangrove-derived carbon is only detectable in a limited number of species, and suggests that local and imported algal sources are a major source of carbon for benthic invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests. These results provide new insights into carbon utilization patterns in vegetated tropical intertidal habitats and show a striking similarity with results from temperate salt marsh ecosystems where local plant production has often been found to contribute little to intertidal foodwebs.

AB  - Wetlands and tidal marshes in the Rhode River estuary of the Chesapeake Bay act as important sources of dissolved organic carbon and strongly absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) for adjacent estuarine waters. The effects of solar exposure on the photochemical degradation of colored DOM (CDOM) were examined for material derived from different sources (estuarine and freshwater parts of the Rhode River, sub-watershed stream, marshes) in this estuarine ecosystem. Consistent with changes in fluorescence emission, absorption loss upon exposure to different portions of the solar spectrum (i.e. different long-pass cut-off filters) occurred across the entire spectrum but the wavelength of maximum photobleaching decreased as the cut-off wavelength of the filter decreased. Our results illustrate that solar exposure can cause either an increase or a decrease in the CDOM absorption spectral slope, S-CDOM, depending on the spectral quality of irradiation and, thus, on the parameters (e.g. atmospheric composition, concentration of UV-absorbing water constituents) that affect the spectral characteristics of the light to which CDOM is exposed. We derived a simple spectral model for describing the effects of solar exposure on CDOM optical quality. The model accurately, and consistently, predicted the observed dependence of CDOM photobleaching on the spectral quality of solar exposure.

TI  - Multiyear patterns of fungal biomass dynamics and productivity within naturally decaying smooth cordgrass shoots
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ascomycetous fungi are predominant secondary microbial producers of the smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) shoot decay system. A 3-yr examination of concentrations of living fungal mass (as ergosterol content) in naturally decaying cordgrass, and of instantaneous rates of cordgrass-fungal production las rates of incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into ergosterol at a standard temperature of 20 degreesC), was conducted in three salt-marsh watersheds of Sapelo Island. Though the years of study were climatologically different (e.g., rainfall ranging over a factor similar to2), ergosterol content of decaying leaves was not different from year to year, with a grand mean of 371 mug ergosterol g(-1) organic mass of decaying system, and there was little difference among yearly average fungal productivities (range = 155-217 mug fungal organic mass g(-1) system organic mass h(-1) for autumn-spring data). Significant differences in ergosterol content of decaying leaves were found among marsh watersheds, probably due to differences in nitrogen (but not phosphorus) availability, but these were not large (maximum 1.3-fold for multiseasonal data, and differences were not found among marsh subsites (short to tall shoot) nor, for the most part, among types or parts of decaying leaves. Season of sampling, however, had a large effect upon fungal biomass and g-1 organic mass of decaying blades) than in summer or autumn (<310 <mu>g g(-1)). Among the potential reasons for this unexpected pattern of seasonality might be (1) greater access of mycophagous invertebrates and/or bacterial competitors due to higher tides and lower elevation of leaves in late summer and fall, and (2) leaching of leaf digestate during periods of high rainfall and high spring tides. Significant correlations were found between ergosterol content of decaying leaves and mean tidal height for the 3 months before sampling (r = -0.77) and for fungal productivities and 3-month rainfall (r- = -0.62). Grazing of decaying leaves by salt-marsh periwinkles over the range of snail densities of the study sites (0-85 m(-2)) gave no clear evidence of depression of fungal biomass or repression of fungal activity, contrary to previous findings for higher snail densities. The calculated seasonal change in living fungal percentage of decaying leaves was from similar to6 (summer-autumn) to 9% (winter-spring), and in 6-month fungal production, the change was from 101 to 434 g organic fungal mass m(-2) marsh surface.

TI  - Changes of Biogenic Elements in Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa from Salt Marshes in Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little information is available on biogenic elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and the ecological stoichiometric characteristics of plants in coastal wetlands. To investigate the contents of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur of plants, and their ecological stoichiometric characteristics in the Yellow (Huanghe) River Delta, plant samples were collected from two typical salt marshes (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis wetlands) during the period of from August to October in 2007, and the ratios of C/N, C/P, N/P, C/N/P and C/N/P/S were calculated. Results showed that during the studying period, plant C, N and P were lower than the global average values, and plant N and P were lower than the China's average values. Leaf C and S in Suaeda salsa were significantly lower than those in Phragmites australis (P < 0.05), and leaf N and P in Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). Average C/N ratios were 23.75 in leaf, 73.36 in stem, 65.67 in root of Suaeda salsa, and 33.77 in leaf, 121.68 in stem, 97.13 in root of Phragmites australis. Average C/N ratios of Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis were all great than 25, indicating the salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta is an N limitation system. Average C/P ratios were 276.78 in leaf, 709.28 in stem and 1031.32 in root of Suaeda salsa, and 536.94 in leaf, 768.13 in stem and 875.22 in root of Phragmites australis. The average N/P ratios of Suaeda salsa were 12.92 in leaf, 10.77 in stem and 10.91 in root, and the average N/P ratios of Phragmites australis were 16.40 in leaf, 7.40 in stem and 6.92 in root, indicating the Suaeda salsa wetlands were N limited and Phragmites australis wetlands were N limited in August and P limited in October in 2007. The average C/N, C/P and C/N/P ratios in Suaeda salsa and Pragmites australis were higher than the global average values, indicating the lower quality of organic matter provided by wetland plants in the Yellow River delta.

TI  - Invasive alien plants increase CH4 emissions from a subtropical tidal estuarine wetland
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas whose emission from the largest source, wetlands is controlled by a number of environmental variables amongst which temperature, water-table, the availability of substrates and the CH4 transport properties of plants are most prominent and well characterised. Coastal wetland ecosystems are vulnerable to invasion by alien plant species which can make a significant local contribution to altering their species composition. However the effect of these changes in species composition on CH4 flux is rarely examined and so is poorly understood. Spartina alterniflora, a perennial grass native to North America, has spread rapidly along the south-east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. From 2002, this rapid invasion has extended to the tidal marshes of the Min River estuary, an area that, prior to invasion was dominated by the native plant Cyperus malaccensis. Here, we compare CH4 flux from the exotic invasive plant S. alterniflora with measurements from the aggressive native species Phragmites australis and the native species C. malaccensis following 3-years of monitoring. CH4 emissions were measured over entire tidal cycles. Soil CH4 production potentials were estimated for stands of each of above plants both in situ and in laboratory incubations. Mean annual CH4 fluxes from S. alterniflora, P. australis and C. malaccensis dominated stands over the 3 years were 95.7 (+/- 18.7), 38.9 (+/- 3.26) and 10.9 (+/- 5.26) g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Our results demonstrate that recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora and the increasing presence of the native plant P. australis has significantly increased CH4 emission from marshes that were previously dominated by the native species C. malaccensis. We also conclude that higher above ground biomass, higher CH4 production and more effective plant CH4 transport of S. alterniflora collectively contribute to its higher CH4 emission in the Min River estuary.

TI  - Keys to successful blue carbon projects: Lessons learned from global case studies
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as "coastal blue carbon". Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - DECOMPOSITION OF ALIPHATIC-AMINES AND AMINO-ACIDS IN ANOXIC SALT-MARSH SEDIMENT
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates and pathways of decomposition of three aliphatic amines (monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl amine) and three amino acids (alanine, glutamic acid, and lysine) were investigated in anoxic salt marsh sediments dominated by input from the saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora. Radiolabeled amines and amino acids added to sediments were either adsorbed or metabolized within 10-20 hours of addition. The proportion of added label that remained unmetabolized in the sediment solid phase was higher for amino acids than for amines. This is due to either the more reversible nature of amine than amino acid adsorption, or to a higher microbial incorporation to respiration ratio for the amines. Remineralization rate constants determined from model calculations are in the order MMA greater than or equal to DMA > TMA and ALA > GLU > LYS, consistent with the adsorption behavior of these compounds. Remineralization rate constants for the amino acids were 6-10 times higher than for the amines. Experiments using specific inhibitors and labeled substrates demonstrated that the decomposition of amines was mediated by methanogens, sulfate reducers, and other microbial groups, while amino acid remineralization occurred mainly through sulfate reduction. Methanogenesis was the primary pathway for consumption of TMA produced from Spartina-amended sediments.

TI  - Measuring the role of seagrasses in regulating sediment surface elevation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide numerous ecosystem services and their rapid global loss may reduce human welfare as well as ecological integrity. In common with the other 'blue carbon' habitats (mangroves and tidal marshes) seagrasses are thought to provide coastal defence and encourage sediment stabilisation and surface elevation. A sophisticated understanding of sediment elevation dynamics in mangroves and tidal marshes has been gained by monitoring a wide range of different sites, located in varying hydrogeomorphological conditions over long periods. In contrast, similar evidence for seagrasses is sparse; the present study is a contribution towards filling this gap. Surface elevation change pins were deployed in four locations, Scotland, Kenya, Tanzania and Saudi Arabia, in both seagrass and unvegetated control plots in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal zone. The presence of seagrass had a highly significant, positive impact on surface elevation at all sites. Combined data from the current work and the literature show an average difference of 31 mm per year in elevation rates between vegetated and unvegetated areas, which emphasizes the important contribution of seagrass in facilitating sediment surface elevation and reducing erosion. This paper presents the first multi-site study for sediment surface elevation in seagrasses in different settings and species.

TI  - EFFECT OF ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ON GROWTH, PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND WATER RELATIONS OF SALT-MARSH GRASS SPECIES
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The C3 grass species Scirpus maritimus L. and Puccinellia maritima (Huds.) Parl., and the C4 grass species Spartina anglica C.E. Hubbard and Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. were grown at ambient (340 p.p.m. CO2) and elevated (580 p.p.m. CO2) atmospheric CO2 concentration, at low (10 mM NaCl) and high salinity (250 mM NaCl) under aerated and anaerobic conditions in the culture solution.  The relative growth rate of both the C3 grass species was enhanced with atmospheric CO2 enrichment, no such increase was found in the C4 grass species.  High salinity reduced growth of the C3 species tested, but this relative growth reduction was not prevented by elevated CO2 concentration.  The growth increase at elevated CO2 of Scirpus maritimus and Puccinellia maritima is greater under aerated than under anaerobic solution conditions.  Water-use efficiency of all species was increased by elevated CO2.  In the case of Scirpus (C3), this increase was caused by increased net photosynthesis, for Spartina patens (C4) photosynthesis was not increased, but transpiration was reduced.  The water potential of the shoot was less negative under conditions of CO2 enrichment, in particular at increased salinity (250 mM NaCl).

AB  - Meiofaunal investigations of Bhitarkanika mangrove sediments revealed the presence of 11 major faunal taxa, of which nematodes were the dominant. Higher densities (no.1 m(-2)) of meiofauna were observed in low water mark (143.68 cm(-2)) and mid water mark (119.2 cm(-2)) at 0-5 cm depth. A positive correlation between meiofaunal densisties and median sorted sediments with high organic matter was observed. Harpacticoid copepod density (28.74 cm(-2)) was found to be 2 times higher than that reported for salt marsh. However, nematodes (108.78 cm(-2)) showed lower densities than those reported for other estuarine habitats.

TI  - Distribution of phosphatase activity in marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acid phosphatase activity (APA) was measured in intertidal marsh sediments located along the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, at North Inlet, SC, and in a marsh on the Rowley River, MA. We found that APA increased from 4.3 +/- 2.3 to 29.3 +/- 18.8 pmol p-nitrophenol released g(-1) h(-1) with decreasing sediment salinity from 22 g l(-1) to 0.1 g l(-1). A study of APA kinetics revealed that the maximum specific activity (V-max) followed the same trend as in situ phosphatase activity. Sediment salinity (p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.43) and pH (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.56) were negatively correlated with APA, while soil organic matter (SOM) content (p < 0.01; R-2 0.57), clay content (p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.37) and sediment organic P (SOP) (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.50) were positively correlated. Collectively, these variables accounted for 78% of the variation in APA (p < 0.05). APA was not significantly correlated with sulfide, NH4+, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), sediment total P, the N:P ratio, aboveground biomass, or macro-organic matter content. In salt marsh plots at North Inlet that were experimentally fertilized with N and P, we found that fertilization with only P had no effect on APA, while N-only or N + P fertilization significantly increased APA to 6.4 mu mol p-nitrophenol released g(-1) h(-1) from 1.5 mu mol p-nitrophenol released g-1 h-1 in control plots. However, even in the fertilized salt marsh plots, APA was still significantly lower than in freshwater, oligohaline and mesohaline marshes.

TI  - Positive trends between salinity and chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a seasonally inverse estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries present high content of chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM, FDOM) affecting the attenuation of ultraviolet and blue radiation. In temperate and tropical estuaries, the main CDOM source is riverine input that generally mixes conservatively with the oceanic waters leading to negative relationships between CDOM and salinity. In Mediterranean estuaries, riverine inputs are more limited or absent during the dry season producing a negative hydrological budget and, consequently, hypersalinity and an inverse circulation pattern. Much remains to be understood about CDOM and FDOM dynamics during rainy and dry periods in these last estuaries. In this study, we determined DOM absorbance and fluorescence in the Bay of Cadiz, Spain during a rainy (high riverine inputs) and dry (hypersaline conditions) period. We determined the absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) and acquired excitation emission matrices (EEMs). The EEMs showed two fluorescence peaks associated with terrestrial humic-like components (peaks A and C), one peak considered to be a marine humic-like component (peak M), and two peaks considered to be amino acid-like components (peaks T and B). The a(355) values ranged from 030 to 1.99 m(-1) with the highest values during the dry season. From the rainy season to the dry season, the overall fluorescence intensity increased and fluorescent peaks M, B, and T increased by greater than two orders of magnitude, whereas the fluorescence intensities of peaks A and C changed less than one order of magnitude. Unlike temperate and tropical estuaries, the a(355) values and fluorescence of the five peaks were positive and significantly related to salinity, but with different slopes. The inverse nature of the Bay of Cadiz during the dry season could be responsible for these positive trends between CDOM/FDOM and salinity. The slopes of the humic-like peaks A and C were lower than the a(355) slope suggesting their preferential losses, likely due to photobleaching. By contrast, the slopes of the amino acid-like peaks B and T were higher than the a(355) slope suggesting an in situ production of these fluorophores, likely due to diffusion from salt marsh and coastal sediments.

TI  - Chemical Fouling Reduction of a Submersible Steel Spectrophotometer in Estuarine Environments Using a Sacrificial Zinc Anode
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of in situ spectrophotometers, such as the S::CAN spectro:: lyser, has expanded the possibilities for high-frequency water quality data collection. However, biological and chemical fouling can degrade the performance of in situ spectrophotometers, especially in saline environments with rapid flow rates. A complex freshwater washing system has been previously designed to reduce chemical fouling for the S::CAN spectro::lyser spectrophotometer. In the current study, we present a simpler, cheaper alternative: the attachment of a sacrificial zinc anode. Results are presented detailing the S::CAN spectro::lyser performance with and without the addition of the sacrificial anode. Attachment of the zinc anode provided efficient corrosion protection during 2-wk deployments in a highly dynamic (average tidal range, 2.5 m) saline tidal saltmarsh creek at Groves Creek, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, Savannah, GA.

TI  - Kinetics of Chemical and Microbial Iron Reduction Along an Inundation Gradient in a Tidal Marsh of the Min River Estuary, Southeastern China
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical (via buffered ascorbate-citrate) and microbial (via Shewanella decolorationis S12) iron reduction kinetics in the surficial tidal marsh sediments of the Min River Estuary were compared at six locations along the inundation gradient. A reactive continuum model was successfully applied to describe the kinetic results. Along the inundation gradient, an enhanced tidal inundation frequency towards the sea resulted in changes in the pH, Eh, salinity, as well as the abundances and fractions of reactive Fe(II) and Fe(III). Significant differences were observed between the chemical and microbial iron reductions among the six locations. Larger reducible Fe(III) pools, higher initial rates, and lower mineral heterogeneity were observed in chemical assays when compared to microbial assays. The microbial and chemical reducible Fe(III) as well as their initial reduction rates generally decreased along the inundation gradient. The chemical mineral heterogeneity gradually increased along the inundation gradient, while the microbial mineral heterogeneities were not significantly different at the six locations. Consequently, a higher iron reduction potential was observed in the uplands when compared to that in the lowlands. The result highlights the role of tidal hydrology and topography in iron reduction and suggest that both the pool and mineral heterogeneities of highly reactive Fe(III) should be considered in iron biogeochemical investigations.

TI  - Changes in nutrient concentration and carbon accumulation in a mediterranean restored marsh (Ebro Delta, Spain)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is now a serious environmental problem worldwide because it disrupts the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems. In the Ebro Delta, intensive rice farming during the 20th century has increased coastal eutrophication and caused ecological and economic impacts. Marsh restoration is as an effective economic and ecological tool to remove nutrients from agricultural runoff, thereby limiting coastal eutrophication impacts and also providing other ecosystem services. The objective of this experimental study was to assess overall N and P concentration reduction, C accumulation and Si buffering in an oligohaline restored marsh receiving nutrient and sediment inputs from river irrigation and rice field drainage waters under different water levels. We established the experimental restored marsh in abandoned deltaic rice fields from August 2009 to June 2012. The study of changes in nutrient concentration was performed in 2010 from June to November. The study of nutrient and carbon accumulation was performed from August 2009 to May 2011. We used two freshwater input type treatments (riverine irrigation and rice field drainage water) and three water level treatments (10, 20 and 30 cm). Our results showed that higher water nutrient concentrations from rice fields caused significantly higher N-NH4+ and P-PO43- concentration reduction (80.76 +/- 1.8% and 17.99 +/- 3.92% respectively). There was also an export in TP and P-PO43- (-45.08 +/- 13.12 and -23.85 +/- 8.15%, respectively) in experimental marsh units receiving river irrigation waters. Significantly lower soil redox conditions and higher total maximum aboveground biomass in the IW treatment were associated with lower N-NO3- concentration reduction and higher Si-SiO2 concentration reduction (94.14 perpendicular to 0.72% and 58.54 perpendicular to 1.08% respectively) than the DW treatment. Higher sediment concentrations from rice fields were associated with higher C accumulation rates (126.10 +/- 6.25 g m(-2)y(-1)) compared with experimental marsh units receiving river irrigation waters (99.44 +/- 8.23 g m(-2)y(-1)). Higher water levels also increased significantly P-PO43- and Si-SiO2 concentration reduction and C accumulation rates within both water type treatments. Our experimental study showed how multiple mechanisms control Nand P concentration reduction, Si buffering and C accumulation. Plant growth may decrease the ability to reduce the input concentration of N-NO3- possibly due to denitrification inhibition via plant oxygenation of marsh soils. Plant uptake may favor Si buffering in the restored marsh, although high water levels may also control Si buffering through higher residence time for diatom uptake. This study indicates that Mediterranean oligohaline restored marshes removed N and P using both river irrigation and rice field drainage waters and also provide C accumulation and Si buffering services. The use of agriculture runoff as a primary source of nutrient and sediment is beneficial for marsh restoration projects focused on C accumulation. In general, higher water levels (20-30 cm) were better for nutrient concentration reduction and C accumulation, but higher water levels were also associated with lower plant biomass.

TI  - Soil respiration dynamics in typical tidal flat wetlands of Hangzhou Bay, China
T2  - GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important carbon pools around the world, and soil respiration is a key process that releases carbon into the atmosphere. In this study, the soil respiration rates of different wetland vegetation zones (Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, Scirpus mariqueter, and a bare mudflat) were investigated in Hangzhou Bay over 12 consecutive months. The wetland soil respiration rate was high in the daytime and low in the nighttime in summer, similar to the diurnal dynamics of soil temperature, and formed an obvious unimodal curve. The seasonal dynamics of soil respiration also formed a unimodal curve: summer > autumn > spring > winter; the soil respiration rates of the vegetation zones were in the rank of P. australis > S. alterniflora > S. mariqueter > bare mudflat, under all diurnal and seasonal conditions. The soil respiration rate had no significant correlation with soil water content but did have a significant exponential correlation with air and soil temperatures. The correlation between the soil temperature and respiration rate in P. australis, S. alterniflora, and bare mudflat was greater than that between the air temperature and respiration rate, while thatin S. mariqueter was quite different. Calculations showed that the Q(10) value, a temperature-sensitive coefficient of soil respiration, was 2.59 +/- 0.58 in the study area, and was greater in bare mudflat than in soil with vegetation. Soil CO2 emissions in P. australis, S. alterniflora, S. mariqueter, and bare mudflat were 6483.40, 5228.96, 2295.48, and 975.48 gm(-2) yr(-1) respectively.

TI  - Tidal Wetland Community Response to Varying Levels of Flooding by Saline Water
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term data base (2000-2009) was used to evaluate tidal floodwater salinity and the resulting soil biogeochemical setting (methanogenic or sulfate reducing) at 54 substations, which included a variety of marsh and swamp community types along the freshwater/saltwater boundary of the Cape Fear River/Estuary, North Carolina. During this decade, a variety of extreme climatic events, i.e. floods and droughts, occurred, but overall data reflected long-term, natural conditions. At sites flooded by > 1 ppt saline water more than 25 % of the time, wetlands consisted of varying types of tidal marsh. Temperate, tidal swamps were present at sites flooded by this level of saline water less than 12 % of high tides. Flooding > 25 % of tides by > 1 ppt seawater converted soils in those wetlands from methanogenic into sulfate reducing conditions > 50 % of the time. The point along an estuarine gradient where adjacent wetlands are flooded by > 1 ppt saline water less than 25 %, but more than 12 % is the zone of transition. The conversion of a tidal swamp to tidal marsh is not only caused by salt water itself, but by the sulfate constituent in seawater. Once a sufficient concentration of sulfate enters soils, sulfate reducing bacteria become active reducing the sulfate into hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to any wetland plant species not adapted to this toxic substance. The incidence of flooding by high tides containing > 1 ppt salinity is an accurate predictor of functional change in adjacent wetlands. Wetlands receiving intermediate levels of saline water, i.e. 12-25 % flooding with 1 ppt floodwater, were in some state of transition from swamp to marsh. Once trees in tidal swamps are killed, the wetland moves inevitably towards a tidal marsh dominated by species of herbaceous vascular plants with varying tolerance to saline water.

TI  - Compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in plant-root microbiomes along a salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling the relative influences of soil properties and plant-host on root-associated microbiomes in natural systems is challenging, given that spatially segregated soil types display distinct historical legacies. In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.

TI  - Species-rich plantings increase biomass and nitrogen accumulation in a wetland restoration experiment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our test of the hypothesis that biomass and nitrogen would increase with more species-rich plantings simultaneously vegetated a salt marsh restoration site and demonstrated that on average, randomly chosen, 6-species plantings accumulated more biomass and nitrogen than the mean for 0- and 1-species assemblages, with the mean for 3-species assemblages being intermediate. In addition, we found that individual species (from the pool of eight native halophytes) differed in their functional capacity, with Salicornia virginica (Sv) and Jaumea carnosa contributing the greatest biomass when planted alone, while Triglochin concinna had the highest tissue N concentrations. When planted alone, Sv accumulated comparable amounts of biomass and nitrogen as in the multispecies plots, indicating that individual species can have a large effect on particular functions. Soil TKN in the surface 0-5 cm was greater in 6-species plots than unplanted plots in 1999, while both 3- and 6-species plots were greater than unplanted plots in 2000; however, there were no differences at 5-20 cm depth and no species-specific effects. Root and shoot biomass both increased with species richness, with total biomass of 6-species, plots averaging 995.6 +/- 120.5 g/m(2) in 2000, compared to the mean for 1-species plots (572.1 +/- 90.3 g/m(2)) and unplanted plots (164.5 +/- 24.7 g/m(2)). Still, at the age of three years, root biomass was only about one-third that of the species-rich reference site, and shoot biomass was one-half to one-fifth the maxima reported for reference salt marshes. Species-specific effects were found for Sv, which had high biomass of both roots and shoots in the multispecies plots (55% of aboveground biomass in 3-species plots and 41% in 6-species plots) and the highest pool of N (52% of the N pool in 3-species plots and 42% in 6-species plots), even though only one-eighth of the initial plantings were Sv. However, when plots with this species were excluded from the analysis, the species-richness effect persisted. Thus, ecosystem function, as measured by biomass. and N accumulation, increased with species richness regardless of dominance by the highly productive,Sv. We conclude that manipulating the richness and composition of plantings offers ecosystem restorationists an effective tool-for accelerating the rate of functional development.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora dieback recovery correlates with increased acetylene reduction activity in saltmarsh sediments
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes occasionally exhibit areas where the plants have all died off for no apparent reason. These dieback areas remain devoid of plant growth for months to years. An analysis of microbial acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and porewater chemistry of four such diebacks has been carried out on marshes in the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, U.S.A. Four different diebacks were studied and sediments in all of them showed low rates of ARA, relative to sediments from the control areas which were populated by healthy S. alterniflora plants. The pore water of all the dieback sediments had higher salinities than the controls when this study began, but this trend was not consistent over the 18-month study period. Furthermore, dissolved ammonium and sulfide in the pore water, microbial biomass, organic matter and macro-organic matter content did not show a consistent trend differentiating the control and dieback sediments over this study period. During the course of this study, one of the diebacks recovered and the recolonisation of the barren area with healthy plants correlated with a full recovery of sediment ARA. The return of ARA to the sediments of this recovered marsh could not be correlated, however, with any of the porewater parameters measured (including NH4+), nor with any of the sediment characteristics. It is concluded that the lower levels of bacterial ARA in the diebacks may be due to the lack of essential factors associated with healthy spartina plants. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Microbial communities associated with electrodes harvesting electricity from a variety of aquatic sediments
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The microbial communities associated with electrodes from underwater fuel cells harvesting electricity from five different aquatic sediments were investigated. Three fuel cells' were constructed with marine, salt-marsh, or freshwater sediments incubated in the laboratory. Fuel cells were also deployed in the field in salt marsh sediments in New Jersey and estuarine sediments in Oregon, USA. All of the sediments produced comparable amounts of power. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences after 37 months of incubation demonstrated that all of the energy-harvesting anodes were highly enriched in microorganisms in the delta-Proteobacteria when compared with control electrodes not connected to a cathode. Geobacteraceae accounted for the majority of delta-Proteobacterial sequences or all of the energy-harvesting anodes, except the one deployed at the Oregon estuarine site. Quantitative PCR analysis of 16S rRNA genes and culturing studies indicated that Geobacteraceae were 100-fold more abundant on the marine-deployed anodes versus controls. Sequences most similar to microorganisms in the family Desulfobulbaceae predominated on the anode deployed in the estuarine sediments, and a significant proportion of the sequences recovered from the freshwater anodes were closely related to the Fe(III)-reducing isolate, Geothrix fermentans. There was also a specific enrichment of microorganisms on energy harvesting cathodes, but the enriched populations varied with the sediment/water source. Thus, future studies designed to help optimize the harvesting of electricity from aquatic sediments or waste organic matter should focus on the electrode interactions of these microorganisms which are most competitive in colonizing anodes and cathodes.

TI  - Long-term response of fishes and other fauna to restoration of former salt hay farms: multiple measures of restoration success
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
M3  - Review
AB  - This synthesis brings together published and unpublished data in an evaluation of restoration of former salt hay farms to functioning salt marshes. We compared nine years of field measurements between three restored marshes (Dennis, Commercial, and Maurice River Townships) and a reference marsh (Moores Beach) in the mesohaline portion of Delaware Bay. In the process, we compared channel morphology, geomorphology, vegetation, sediment organic matter, fish assemblages, blue crabs, horseshoe crabs, benthic infauna, and diamondback terrapins. For fishes we compared structural (distribution, abundance) and functional (feeding, growth, survival, reproduction, production) aspects to evaluate the restored marshes in an Essential Fish Habitat context. Marsh vegetation and drainage density responded gradually and positively with restored marshes approximating the state of the reference marsh within the nine-year study period. The fauna responded more quickly and dramatically with most measures equal or greater in the restored marshes within the first one or two years after restoration. Differences in response time between the vegetation and the fauna imply that the faunal response was more dependent on access to the shallow intertidal marsh surface and intertidal and subtidal creeks than on characteristics of the vegetated marsh. The fishes in created subtidal creeks in restored marshes responded immediately and maintained fish assemblages similar to the reference marsh over the study period. The intertidal creek fish assemblages tended to become more like the reference marsh in the last years of the comparison. Overall, these results document the success of the restoration and how marshes function for both resident and transient fauna, especially fishes.

AB  - Thirty-four vegetation clusters identified in the present study, after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA multivariate techniques, were assigned into 8 vegetation types, each of definite vegetation and habitat characters.  The suggested vegetation types are well segregated along the DCA axis one which reflects soil moisture, salinity (as indicated by EC values), fertility (as indicated by the organic matter and nitrogen contents) and species diversity gradients.  In general, soil moisture and soil fertility increase and species diversity decreases with the following sequence of vegetation types:  Echinops spinosissimus-Ononis serrata on inland sand dunes, Pancratium maritimum on coastal sand dunes, Halocnemum strobilaceum-Salsola kali in saline sand deposits, Atriplex halimus-Chenopodium murale along the terraces and slopes of drains, Arthrocnemum glaucum-Tamarix nilotica in salt marshes, Chenopodium murale along the slopes of drains, Phragmites australis along the littoral zones of drains, and Lemna gibba-Potamogeton crispus in the water zone.  This sequence reflects also a gradient of human interference, starting with the vegetation of the less disturbed habitats (sand dunes and saline sand deposits) and ending with the fully man-made habitats (drain zones).

TI  - Spatial variability of soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and storage in an alpine wetland in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study considers the spatial variability of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in a drained alpine wetland and the possible relationships with soil properties. Top 0-0.30 m soil samples were collected in a typical alpine wetland in the south-eastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau using grid sampling. There was high spatial variability for soil organic carbon density (SOCD), soil total nitrogen density (STND), and soil total phosphorous density (STPD) in the drained alpine wetland. Spherical models best described the structure of the semivariograms for SOCD and STPD, and an exponential model for STND, with the range parameter of <4 m. Similar spatial distribution with lower or higher patches of C, N, and P storage were observed. SOCD, STND, and STPD were significantly negatively correlated with soil moisture (P<0.01), and significantly positively correlated with bulk density (P<0.01). However, no significant correlations were observed between SOCD, STND, and STPD and soil pH values. Wetland drainage might lead to higher C, N, and P densities in top 0.30 m soils due to peat compaction; thus, it is necessary to incorporate water table fluctuations or the whole depth of peat layers to estimating precisely C, N and P storage.

TI  - Denitrification capacity in a subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal waters are severely threatened by nitrogen (N) loading from direct groundwater discharge. The subterranean estuary, the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and sea water in a coastal aquifer, has a high potential to remove substantial N. A network of piezometers was used to characterize the denitrification capacity and groundwater flow paths in the subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh. "N-enriched nitrate was injected into the subterranean estuary (in situ push-pull method) to evaluate the denitrification capacity of the saturated zone at multiple depths (125300 cm) below different zones (upland-marsh transition zone, high marsh, and low marsh). From the upland to low marsh, the water table became shallower, groundwater dissolved oxygen decreased, and groundwater pH, soil organic carbon, and total root biomass increased. As groundwater approached the high and low marsh, the hydraulic gradient increased and deep groundwater upwelled. In the warm season (groundwater temperature > 12 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity within each zone was observed. The warm season low marsh groundwater denitrification capacity was significantly higher than all other zones and depths. In the cool season (groundwater temperature < 10.5 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity was only found in the low marsh. Additions of dissolved organic carbon did not alter groundwater denitrification capacity suggesting that an alternative electron donor, possibly transported by tidal inundation from the root zone, may be limiting. Combining flow paths with denitrification capacity and saturated porewater residence time, we estimated that as much as 29-60 mg N could be removed from 11 of water flowing through the subterranean estuary below the low marsh, arguing for the significance of subterranean estuaries in annual watershed scale N budgets.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Hidden forests, the role of vegetated coastal habitats in the ocean carbon budget
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats, including seagrass and macroalgal beds, mangrove forests and salt marshes, form highly productive ecosystems, but their contribution to the global carbon budget remains overlooked, and these forests remain "hidden" in representations of the global carbon budget. Despite being confined to a narrow belt around the shoreline of the world's oceans, where they cover less than 7 million km(2), vegetated coastal habitats support about 1 to 10% of the global marine net primary production and generate a large organic carbon surplus of about 40% of their net primary production (NPP), which is either buried in sediments within these habitats or exported away. Large, 10-fold uncertainties in the area covered by vegetated coastal habitats, along with variability about carbon flux estimates, result in a 10-fold bracket around the estimates of their contribution to organic carbon sequestration in sediments and the deep sea from 73 to 866 Tg C yr(-1), representing between 3% and 1/3 of oceanic CO2 uptake. Up to 1/2 of this carbon sequestration occurs in sink reservoirs (sediments or the deep sea) beyond these habitats. The organic carbon exported that does not reach depositional sites subsidizes the metabolism of heterotrophic organisms. In addition to a significant contribution to organic carbon production and sequestration, vegetated coastal habitats contribute as much to carbonate accumulation as coral reefs do. While globally relevant, the magnitude of global carbon fluxes supported by salt-marsh, mangrove, seagrass and macroalgal habitats is declining due to rapid habitat loss, contributing to loss of CO2 sequestration, storage capacity and carbon subsidies. Incorporating the carbon fluxes' vegetated coastal habitats' support into depictions of the carbon budget of the global ocean and its perturbations will improve current representations of the carbon budget of the global ocean.

TI  - PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN AN OLIGOHALINE TIDAL MARSH
T2  - Vegetatio
M3  - Article
AB  - An oligohaline tidal marsh on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, LA [USA] was characterized with respect to the distributions and abundances of plant species over spatial and temporal gradients using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). The distribution of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter. They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity). Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake. Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens. The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland. Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions. We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake. Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community. The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials. Most of the annuals frequently co-occurred with Sagittaria lancifolia, which was the shortest in stature and had the least persistent canopy of the three mid-seasonal dominant perennials.

AB  - Many researchers assume a proportional relationship among the atmospheric CO, concentration, temperature, and sea level. Thus, the rate of sea-level rise should increase in concert with the documented exponential increase in CO, Although sea surface temperature has increased in places over the past century and short-term sea level rose abruptly during the 1990s, it is difficult to demonstrate a proportional relationship using existing geologic or historic records. Tide gauge records in the United States cover too short a time interval to verify acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise, although multicentury tide gauge and staff records from the Netherlands and Sweden suggest a mid-19th-century acceleration in sea-level rise. Reconstructions of sea-level changes for the past 1000 years derived using benthic foraminifer data from salt marshes along the East Coast of the United States suggest an increased rate of relative sea-level rise beginning in the 1600s. Geologic records of relative sea-level rise for the past 6000 years are available for several sites along the US East Coast from C-14-dated basal peat below salt marshes and estuarine sediments. When these three scales of sea-level variation are integrated, adjusted for postglacial isostatic movement, and replotted, the range of variation in sea level suggested by basal peat ages is within +/- 1 meter of the long-term trend. The reconstruction from Long Island Sound data shows a linear rise in sea level beginning in the mid-1600s at a rate consistent with the historic record of mean high water. Long-term tide gauge records from Europe and North America show similar trends since the mid-19th century. There is no clear proportional exponential increase in the rate of sea-level rise. If proportionality exists among sea level, atmospheric CO, and temperature, there may be a significant time lag before an anthropogenic increase in the rate of sea-level rise occurs.

TI  - Accumulation and distribution of Zn in the shoots and reproductive structures of the halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya virginica as a function of salinity
T2  - PLANTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Kosteletzkya virginica is a wetland halophyte that is a good candidate for rehabilitation of degraded salt marshes and production of oil as biodiesel. Salt marshes are frequently contaminated by heavy metals. The distribution of Zn in vegetative and reproductive organs of adult plants, and the NaCl influence on this distribution remain unknown and were thus explored in the present study. Plants were cultivated in a nutrient film technique system, from seedling stage until seed maturation in a control, Zn (100 mu M), NaCl (50 mM) or Zn + NaCl medium. Photosynthesis, ion nutrition, malondialdehyde and non-protein thiol concentrations were quantified. Zinc distribution in reproductive organs was estimated by a laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry procedure (LA-ICP-MS). Adult plants accumulated up to 2 mg g(-1) DW Zn in the shoots. Zinc reduced plant growth, inhibited photosynthesis and reduced seed yield. Zinc accumulation in the seeds was only two times higher in Zn-treated plants than in controls. Exogenous NaCl neutralized the damaging action of Zn and modified the Zn distribution through a preferential accumulation of toxic ions in older leaves. Zinc was present in seed testa, endosperm and, to a lower extent, in embryo. Additional NaCl induced a chalazal retention of Zn during seed maturation and reduced final Zn seed content. It is concluded that NaCl 50 mM had a positive impact on the response of K. virginica to Zn toxicity and acts through a modification in Zn distribution rather than a decrease in Zn absorption.

TI  - Tolerance and accumulation of copper in the salt-marsh shrub Halimione portulacoides
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluated the tolerance and accumulation potential in the salt-marsh shrub Halimione portulacoides under moderate and high external Cu levels. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effects of a range of external Cu concentrations (0 to 60 mmol l(-1)) on growth and photosynthetic performance by measuring gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and photosynthetic pigments. We also determined total copper, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur concentrations in the plant tissues. H. portulacoides survived with external Cu concentrations of up to 35 mmol Cu l(-1), although the excess of metal resulted in a biomass reduction of 48%. The effects of Cu on growth were linked to a drastic reduction in net photosynthesis. However, H. portulacoides tolerated Cu levels of up to 15 mmol Cu l(-1) without suffering adverse physiological effects. Our results indicate that this species could play an important role in the restoration of Cu-contaminated soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - FACIES AND SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENT OF THE CARBONATE-DOMINATED CARPATHIAN KEUPER FROM THE TATRICUM DOMAIN: RESULTS FROM THE DOLINA SMYTNIA VALLEY (TATRA MTS, SOUTHERN POLAND)
T2  - ANNALES SOCIETATIS GEOLOGORUM POLONIAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on an interpretation of sedimentary and early diagenetic environment in the carbonate-dominated uppermost Ladinian-Norian succession from the Tatricum domain of the Tatra Mountains as well as its controlling factors. Limestones with cherts are the product of pedogcnic processes, formed during long-term exposures of carbonate substrate. Chalcedony cherts were formed during relatively early diagenesis of pedogenic limestones. Dolostones and dolomitic mudstones were deposited in a kind of salt marshes. Pseudomorphs after sulfates and absence of benthic fauna indicate increased salinity and intensive evaporation. Additionally, low TOC concentration suggests a low productivity in the basin. On the contrary, stable isotope signals indicate that the sedimentary environment was strongly affected by meteoric water. Moreover, delta(18)O and concentration of Sr suggest that dolostones were formed under the influence of both marine and meteoric waters. Dolomitic mudstones could be deposited in a salt-marsh environment fed by distal sheet floods. Components of palynological material and organic compounds in black dolomitic mudstones indicate the terrestrial origin of organic matter. Dolomitic regoliths were formed as the result of subaerial exposure and karstification of dolostones. Coarse-grained siliciclastics and variegated mudstone are interpreted, respectively, as a fluvial channel and flood plain facies of ephemeric fluvial environment. Sedimentary environment of the Keuper sediments was controlled by two main factors: synsedimentary tectonic movements and climate changes. In the latest Ladinian, the Middle Triassic carbonate platform was emerged, what resulted in the development of palaeosols. Block tectonic movements affected the Tatricum Basin in Keuper time. Horsts were emerged, whereas troughs were filled with fluvial or salt marsh sediments. Intensive tectonic movements are suggested by seismic-generated slumps and abrupt facies changes. More intensive chemical weathering and intensive contribution of pure siliciclastics suggest climate pluvialization in late Ladinian early Carnian time. On the contrary, domination of physical weathering indicates the aridization of climate in late Carnian?-Norian time. The upper Carnian?-Norian succession was formed in hot and semi-arid climate conditions. Long-term climate changes was masked by short-term climate fluctuations. Geochemical indicators suggest that dolostones represent more humid periods, whereas dolomitic mudstones relatively dry periods.

AB  - Despite the scarcity of water, desert ranges of Qatar can support a characteristic diversity of species and an all-year-round supply of feed. A correlation between carbon dioxide fixation mechanism, distribution of species, and physiognomy of the landscape was observed. Winter and summer annual forbs of the Asteraceae and Fabaceae have variable average contents of water, dry matter, and nutrients. Succulent shrubs of the Chenopodiaceae inhabit littoral salt marshes and have high average water and ash contents. Grasses of the Poaceae are widely distributed in salt meadows, depressions, and cultivated land. They have high contents of crude-fibre, and are an important source of energy for the diet of range animals.

TI  - Hurricane signals in salt marsh sediments: Inorganic sources and soil volume
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inorganic content of 51 dated sediment cores from Mississippi River deltaic plain salt marsh wetlands peaks with the landfall of hurricanes. Variations in the inorganic sediment content demonstrate no temporal coherence with changes in either the Mississippi River suspended matter concentration or discharge, or with wetland losses on this coast. The inorganic matter brought to wetlands during hurricanes is sufficient to account for the accumulated inorganic sediment, and the volume averages 9% of the soil volume. A "sediment deficit'' hypothesis, which makes a causal connection between a changing inorganic supply and the dramatically high wetland losses on this coast, is therefore rejected. Our results support the hypothesis that wetlands of an undeveloped coast receive the majority of their inorganic sediments from offshore and not from overbank flooding or through crevasses. Restoration and wetland maintenance (prevention) goals should be implemented with this in mind: the coastal wetland losses of the last century along this coast appear to be a consequence of the diminished accumulation of organic matter and not from variations in inorganic sediment loading.

TI  - SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION RATES, HISTORICAL INPUT, POSTDEPOSITIONAL MOBILITY AND RETENTION OF MAJOR ELEMENTS AND TRACE-METALS IN SALT-MARSH SEDIMENTS OF THE SCHELDT ESTUARY, SW NETHERLANDS
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of major elements and trace metals has been studied in two radiodated salt marsh sediment cores (core K and core E) of the Scheldt estuary, in order to determine the recent pollution history and to assess the impact of diagenetic processes. The sedimentation rates, based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 inventories, were 0.84-0.90 cm/yr in core E and 1.3-1.7 cm/yr in core K. The sediments show a vertical redox zonation with an oxic upper layer, where trace metals are mobilized, overlying a reduced layer where the metals are precipitated. Though these diagenetic processes have greatly modified the original trace metal distribution, anthropogenic maxima could be identified for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn during the mid-sixties. A second pollution maximum was found at the end of the seventies for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The down-core distributions of Mn, Fe, total S, CaCO3, Sr, Co, and Ni are controlled by diagenetic processes, whereas the P profiles reflect both anthropogenic and diagenetic impacts.Rapid remobilization of trace metals occurs after their deposition on the marshes due to the occurrence of oxic conditions in the upper sediment layer, preventing precipitation of metal sulfides from the pore waters. Though the metals are partly reprecipitated in the reduced sediment layer (e.g. as sulfides), the inventory of the cores suggests that Cr is the only metal which is completely retained by the sediments. Slight losses are observed for Fe, Co, and Pb (11-14%), moderate losses for Zn, Cu, and Ni (19-25%), and high losses for P, Mn, and Cd (40-50%). Similar mobilization of trace metals is to be expected in other salt marshes if a distinct oxic sediment layer is present.

TI  - Heavy metal contamination in soils from freshwater wetlands to salt marshes in the Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration and distribution of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and Fe were determined to estimate soil contamination in freshwater wetlands (S1 and S2), brackish wetlands (S3) and salt marshes (S4 and S5). Soil cores with depths up to 50 cm were seasonally collected with three repeats. Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3. Horizontally, eight heavy metals generally showed a decreasing and then increasing trend in the 0-40 cm soils, with the lowest and highest values in S4 and S5, respectively. Three hotspots of metal accmulation in the top 20 cm soils were observed in the study area.The sediment quality guidelines indicated that occasionally adverse effects of As and Cu can be anticipated. Besides, according to the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index, Cd exhibited no pollution to moderate pollution level in these wetlands. The potential ecological risk index indicated the moderate pollution degree in soils of five wetlands. Principle component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that eight heavy metals mainly derived from natural source, and SOM and soil texture were main factors influencing the accumulation and distribution of eight heavy metals in the studied wetlands.

AB  - Critical military training and testing on lands along the nations coastal and estuarine shorelines are increasingly placed at risk because of encroachment pressures in surrounding areas, impairments due to other anthropogenic disturbances, and changes in climate and sea level. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) intends to enhance and sustain its training and testing assets and also optimize its stewardship of natural resources through the development and application of an ecosystem-based management approach on DoD installations. To accomplish this goal, particularly for installations in estuarine/coastal environments, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) launched the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) as a 10-year effort at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) in North Carolina. The results of the second 5 years of the program (DCERP2) are presented in the DCERP2 Final Report.There were four overarching objectives of DCERP2. The first objective was to understand the effects of climate change impacts, including warming temperatures, variability in the hydrological cycle, storm events, and sea level rise on the coastal ecosystems at MCBCL from observations and measurements made over the 10-year program. The second objective was to understand the carbon cycle of the coastal and terrestrial ecosystems at MCBCL through a highly integrated sampling program. The third objective was to develop models, tools, and indicators to evaluate current and projected future ecosystem state changes and translate scientific findings into actionable information for installation managers. The last objective was to recommend adaptive management strategies to sustain ecosystem natural resources within the context of an active military installation.A goal of CW-5 was to measure the influence of salt marshes on N, P, and C in tidal creek channels. Salt marsh sediment microbial communities and vegetation may affect N, P, and C in creek water overlying the marsh during high tide; these concentration changes would subsequently alter the flux of N, P, and C in the tidal creek channel during low tide. The objective of this research was to measure the rate of concentration change in N, P, and C in a volume of water isolated on the marsh during high tide. This rate of concentration change can be extrapolated across a salt marsh surface to estimate the mass export of N, P, and C back to the tidal creek channel at low tide. Analysis of these data is provided in the CW-5 chapter of the DCERP2 Final Research Report.

TI  - Impacts of Climate and Nutrients on Carbon Sequestration Rate by Wetlands: A Meta-analysis
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global numerous wetlands are the most productive ecosystem and have high carbon sequestration potential to mitigate increasing CO(2)in the atmosphere. However, few are available on estimating average carbon sequestration rates by global wetlands (Carbon(sq)) at century timescale. In this article, Carbon(sq)data of 473 wetland soil/sediment cores from the literatures were collected in detail by the meta-analysis method. These cores were no more than 300 years old and spanned a latitudinal range from 33.6 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N. Globally, the average Carbon(sq)was 185.2 g/(m(2)center dot yr) regardless of wetland types. Carbon(sq)varied remarkably between wetland types and ranked as an order of salt marsh (247.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > mangrove (229.8 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > freshwater marsh (196.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > peatland (76.9 g/(m(2)center dot yr)). Carbon(sq)was positively related to mean annual temperature (AMT) and annual precipitation (Pre). Nitrogen was the most common and primary factor controlling Carbon(sq)regardless of wetland types.

M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of mathematical simulation models helps to organize current information and extend inferences from available data. During the past two decades, microbial ecology has undergone rapid developments in both quantity and quality of available data. In particular, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of microbial food web dynamics in the Duplin River watershed at Sapelo Island, Georgia. Here we provide examples of how modeling and microbial ecology have interfaced. In the early 1970s, construction of a 14-compartment model of carbon flow through a salt marsh ecosystem aided in directing method development and field experiments on the sediment microbial community. In turn, the results of field experiments corroborated the model's postulated controls on the community. Also, during the past 12 years we have developed a series of simulation models reflecting the growing information on the aquatic microbial food web. Early models provided evidence for the microbial loop but illustrated the paucity of knowledge concerning controls for bacterial growth on detritus. Results from newer methods in microbial ecology and studies from the Duplin River have allowed us to construct a model which provides realistic simulations but is also highly sensitive to certain parameter value changes (e.g., in organic matter availability and grazing by protozoans). Thus improvements in model structure and corroboration of the models with extant data have been closely tied to methodological and conceptual advances in microbial ecology. The relationship is viewed as synergistic, as needs for model parameter values and equation forms have directed further development of methods, experimentation, and field observations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment transport in the salt marsh and the lagoon of Penouille is driven by tidal currents, waves, wind, and ice rafting, which interact with topography and vegetation to control the spatial distribution of surface sediments. Multiple linear regressions of 203 samples of marsh surface sediments show that grain size gets finer and organic matter content increases with distance from the lagoon inlet, the sandy peninsula, the closest creek, and the lagoon. The vegetation parameters and surface microtopography have only a minor influence. Locally, grain size can get finer with elevation, while organic matter content increases. However, across the entire marsh, grain size exhibits the opposite trend with elevation, a consequence of aeolian transport and ice rafting. The 94 samples covering the lagoon show a trend of finer grain size with distance from the lagoon inlet and with sea grass cover. Penouille marsh has been relatively stable from 1975 to 2008: analysis of five georeferenced aerial photographs shows that only 3% of the marsh area was lost due to outer marsh edge retreat. Ten sediment cores collected in the marsh show a thickness of 0.14-0.72 m of marsh sediments overlying a sandy substrate. Radiocarbon dates suggest that marsh establishment occurred in the north side of the lagoon around 1000-1200 cal BP. Accretion rates based on radiocarbon dates are 0.4-1 mm/y for several centuries, whereas Cs-137 dating indicates rates of 1-3 mm/y since 1963, and accretion plates indicate 2.9 0.9 mm/y between 2010 and 2012. Accretion rates since 1963 are similar to the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) of 1.5 mm/y at Penouille for the 1969-2014 period. However, the accelerated RSLR of 3.7 mm/y observed over the last 20 years and additional RSLR due to climate change may progressively drown the marsh if accretion rate does not substantially increase.

TI  - The contribution of macrophyte-derived organic matter to microbial biomass in salt-marsh sediments: Stable carbon isotope analysis of microbial biomarkers
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable carbon isotope ratios of bacterial biomarkers were determined to infer sources of organic carbon used by bacteria in the sediments of three salt marshes. Biomarkers studied were polar lipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA), mainly bacteria-specific, methyl-branched i15:0 and a15:0. Experiments showed that isotopic fractionation between substrate and biomarkers was relatively constant (-4 to -6 parts per thousand, on average) compared to the wide range in C-13/C-12 ratios of carbon sources found in the studied marshes. At the Spartina site of the Waarde Marsh (The Netherlands), biomarker C-13/C-12 ratios were depleted by approximately 6 parts per thousand more than expected for bacteria growing on Spartina litter and were similar to an unvegetated control sediment. This pattern suggested that local macrophyte production was of little importance and that other material (probably of algal origin) was the dominant carbon source for bacterial growth. Spartina contributed about half of the carbon in bacterial PLEA at the Kattendijke Marsh (The Netherlands) and dominated at the Great Marshes (U.S.). The variation in bacterial carbon sources in these marshes was probably related to estimated inputs of nonmacrophyte organic matter to the sediment. At the Waarde Marsh, a clear plant species effect was found as coupling between plant and bacteria was more important in Scirpus maritimus than in Spartina anglica. The contribution of local plant production to bacterial biomass in salt-marsh sediments is highly variable between marshes and depends on the input of nonmacrophyte material by sedimentation in comparison to local plant input, which in turn may differ among plant species.

AB  - The biogeochemistry at the rhizosphere of salt marsh plants only recently has started being thoroughly investigated. Knowledge on the subject is relevant to realize the potentialities of those plants for rhizoremediation (biological remediation that takes advantage of the synergy between vegetation and rhizosphere microorganisms). Roots and microorganisms living in the root zone and growing on the root exudates, can act as an independent subsystem in the sediment, which is called the rhizosphere. The concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, organic matter and speciation and concentration of trace chemical species are different at the rhizosphere and surrounding sediment and condition the pH and redox potential.In the ambit of a project on this topic, targeting different salt marsh plants (Halimione portulacoides, Juncus maritimus and Scirpus maritimus) which colonize estuarine sediments in Cavado, Douro and Sado Portuguese Rivers, the role vegetation plays on distribution and remediation of trace metals, organochlorine pesticides and butyltin compounds has been surveyed. Studies in situ, ex situ and in vitro have been carried out. Attention has been also paid to the influence on the biological response of plants, of metal complexing exudates and possible synergistic or antagonistic effects of different pollutants concomitantly present at the rhizosphere. A summary of the results obtained so far by our research team is presented in this chapter.

TI  - The Effects of Plant Invasion and Ecosystem Restoration on Energy Flow through Salt Marsh Food Webs
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured the effects of a plant invasion (Phragmites australis) on resident fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in New England salt marshes by assessing diet quality at the food web base and by quantifying the importance of primary producers to secondary production using a recently developed Bayesian mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, "SIAR"). Spartina alterniflora, the dominant native plant, exhibited significantly greater leaf toughness and higher C/N ratios relative to P. australis. Benthic microalgae and phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) exhibited the lowest C/N indicating higher diet quality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in SIAR by modeling F. heteroclitus at three separate trophic levels (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) using species-specific discrimination factors to determine basal resource contributions. Overall, the best-fitting models include those that assume F. heteroclitus resides approximately 2.0 trophic levels above primary producers. Using discrimination factors from a range of data sources reported in the literature, our analyses revealed that consumers rely less on benthic microalgae and phytoplankton in restricted marshes (7-23 % and 11-44 %, respectively) relative to reference marshes (5-34 % and 23-48 %, respectively), resulting in a shift in diet toward invasive plant consumption (0-27 %). This is likely due to increased P. australis cover and marsh surface shading leading to decreased microalgal biomass, combined with reduced flooding of the marsh surface that favors terrestrial invertebrate assemblages. Restoration decreased the quantity of P. australis in the food web (0-15 %) and increased the importance of microalgae (1-30 %), phytoplankton (19-48 %), and native plants (23-63 %), indicating a shift in ecological recovery toward reference conditions.

TI  - Ecophysiological response of native and exotic salt marsh vegetation to waterlogging and salinity: Implications for the effects of sea-level rise
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecophysiological characteristics of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora grown under waterlogging and salinity were investigated to explore their adaptation potential to sea level rise. The seasonal course of phenotypic traits, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of P. australis did not change remarkably under shallow flooding, whereas these variables were sensitive to increasing salinity. Waterlogging exacerbated the negative effects of salinity on shoot growth and photosynthetic activity of P. australis, and the combined stresses led to an absence of tassel and reproductive organs. By contrast, S. alterniflora performed well under both stresses and showed an obvious adaptation of salt secretion with increasing salinity. Light salinity was the optimal condition for S. alterniflora, and the tassel growth, chlorophyll content and fluorescence characters under moderate stresses did not differ notably. The Na+ and Cl- concentrations in leaves of both species increased, and the K+ content decreased in response to salinity. Under moderate and high saline levels, the ion concentrations in S. alterniflora were maintained at relatively consistent levels with increased salt secretion. We expect the degradation of P. australis and further colonization of S. alterniflora under prolonged flooding and saltwater intrusion from sea level rise on the coastline of China.

TI  - Tepexpan revisited: A multiple proxy of local environmental changes in relation to human occupation from a paleolake shore section in Central Mexico
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Building up a scenario of Late Pleistocene-Holocene environmental change and human-landscape interactions in Central Mexico - one of the key areas for the natural and cultural history of America - requires development of local paleoenvironmental reconstructions. We studied the Tepexpan section at the edge of Texcoco a paleolake, near the mouth of Teotihuacan Valley as a multiproxy record of the environmental dynamics at the shore in the Basin of Mexico throughout the period of human occupation. The section is located in an ecotone affected by intensive and variable geomorphic processes and includes lacustrine, fluvial and volcanic sediments as well as paleosols. Our chronological scale is based on 6 AMS C-14 dates from pollen concentrates and paleosol organic matter. The lower segment of the section dominated by the lacustrine sediments yielded pollen spectra; in the upper segment the record is based on the pedogenetic characteristics of paleosols. Different proxies agree in demonstrating the general trend (although some reversals are apparent) of decreasing effective moisture since MIS3: it is reflected first in the increase of herbaceous pollen after 27 ka BP, the decrease of lake level, the cessation of lacustrine sedimentation and beginning of marsh soil development at 10 ka BP and finally, the shift from hydromorphic to dryland semiarid pedogenesis in the late Holocene. We assume that this trend was climatically controlled, whereas the deposition of sedimentary layers enriched with tephra are related to the pulses of volcanic activity; the pedosedimentary features associated with the upper soil are human-induced. Comparing the proposed scheme of environmental change with the archaeological record we propose that the initial settlers, Late Paleolithic hunters, could have utilized the wet swampy meadows which expanded on the Basin bottom as the lake level lowered and provided the niche for large herbivores during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Development of agriculture and the network of permanent settlements are believed to be linked to the formation of well drained soils. In the methodological perspective the study shows the potential of ecotones as highly dynamic and sensitive systems that may archive valuable paleoecological records. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural wetland is one of the key sources for atmospheric methane. Spartina alterniflora invasion generally increases the soil organic carbon content in coastal marshes of China. In this study, three intact soil cores were collected from the coastal brackish marshes having been invaded by S. alterniflora for 8, 11 and 15 years, respectively, and a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of soil organic carbon content on the methane emission from coastal brackish marsh. The soil organic carbon content increased with the increasing year of S. alterniflora invasion, and the methane emission had an apparent seasonal pattern, with the peak in September. During growth season, the mean methane flux of the marsh having been invaded by S. alterniflora for 15 years and with the soil organic carbon content of 12. 97 g . kg(-1) amounted to 2. 94 mg . m(-2) . h(-1), which was significantly higher than that (1. 95 and 2.34 mg . m(-2) . h(-1)) of the marshes after 8 and 11 years S. alterniflora invasion and with the soil organic carbon content of 8. 11 and 9. 16 g . kg(-1), respectively. It was considered that the increased soil organic carbon content not only increased the supply of dissolved organic carbon for methanogens, but also stimulated the growth of methanogens, which together elevated the methane emission from the coastal marshes invaded by S. alterniflora.

TI  - Early growth interactions between a mangrove and an herbaceous salt marsh species are not affected by elevated CO2 or drought
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are likely to influence future distributions of plants and plant community structure in many regions of the world through effects on photosynthetic rates. In recent decades the encroachment of woody mangrove species into herbaceous marshes has been documented along the U.S. northern Gulf of Mexico coast. These species shifts have been attributed primarily to rising sea levels and warming winter temperatures, but the role of elevated CO2 and water availability may become more prominent drivers of species interactions under future climate conditions. Drought has been implicated as a major factor contributing to salt marsh vegetation dieback in this region. In this greenhouse study we examined the effects of CO2 concentration (similar to 380 ppm, similar to 700 ppm) and water regime (drought, saturated, flooded) on early growth of Avicennia germinans, a C-3 mangrove species, and Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 grass. Plants were grown in monocultures and in a mixed-species assemblage. We found that neither species responded to elevated CO2 over the 10-month duration of the experiment, and there were few interactions between experimental factors. Two effects of water regime were documented: lower A. germinans pneumatophore biomass under drought conditions, and lower belowground biomass under flooded conditions regardless of planting assemblage. Evidence of inter-specific interactions was noted. Competition for aboveground resources (e.g., light) was indicated by lower S. alterniflora stem biomass in mixed-species assemblage compared to biomass in S. alterniflora monocultures. Pneumatophore biomass of A. germinans was reduced when grown in monoculture compared to the mixed-species assemblage, indicating competition for belowground resources. These interactions provide insight into how these species may respond following major disturbance events that lead to vegetation dieback. Site variation in propagule availability and physico-chemical conditions will determine plant community composition and structure following such disturbances when these two species co-occur.

TI  - Carbon mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh soils at the intersection of low-level saltwater intrusion and ferric iron loading
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-level saltwater intrusion and ferric iron (Fe(III)) loading are predicted for many mineral tidal freshwater ecosystems under sea-level rise. To assess their effects on the carbon mineralization processes, in-situ experiments were conducted with four treatments: Fe(III) amendment, saltwater addition, saltwater addition plus Fe (III) amendment, and a control. Soil and porewater samples (0-30 cm) were collected to assess geochemical properties and soil incubation on Days 460 and 580 after the start of the experiment. Saltwater addition increased the salinity from freshwater (0.1 mg.g(-1)) to oligohaline (< 2 mg.g(-1)) and elevated the concentrations of porewater Cl-, SO42-, and NH4+. Fe(III) amendment increased the concentrations of soil Fe(III), Fe(II), and total reduced sulfur (TRS). Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition enhanced the belowground biomass of marsh plants, while neither affected the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools or their ratios. Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition improved the overall mineralization rates (i.e., CO2 plus CH4 production) of the soil at 0-10 cm depths. Methanogenesis decreased under both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition. Strong negative relationships were observed between methanogenesis rates and the concentrations of porewater Cl- and SO42-, and soil Fe(III). Relative to the individual Fe(III) and saltwater treatments, the combined treatment did not further promote overall mineralization rates or further impede methanogenesis potential. Methanogenesis and Fe(III) reduction co-dominated the overall mineralization in the control treatment. Individual loading of Fe(III) and saltwater into the soils induced the predominance of Fe(III) and sulfate reduction, respectively. Under the combined treatment, microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction codominated the overall mineralization, but restrained each other. The shifts in the partitioning of mineralization pathways among treatments were primarily influenced by porewater Cl- and SO42-, followed by Fe(III), and then DOC. Together, the results suggest that the projected modest levels of saltwater intrusion and Fe(III) loading may simultaneously accelerate the belowground C input and mineralization rates, shifting anaerobic pathways away from CH4 production towards Fe(III) and sulfate reduction.

TI  - Polychlorinated biphenyl- and mercury-associated alterations on benthic invertebrate community structure in a contaminated salt marsh in southeast Georgia
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The community structure of a benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage in a contaminated salt marsh was evaluated as part of an ecological characterization of a former chloralkali production facility in Georgia. Sample locations were chosen based on a gradient of the primary contaminants of concern, total mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), primarily Aroclor 1268. Sediment concentrations of Aroclor 1268 ranged from 2.3 to 150 mg/kg dry weight, while mercury concentrations ranged from 15 to 170 mg/kg dry weight in the study area. Mercury and PCBs were determined to be co-located in the sediments. Total organic carbon composition of the sediments was negatively associated with PCB and mercury concentrations. A total of 29 benthic taxa was identified in 49 samples; replicate samples were taken at each of five sampling locations. Mean infaunal density across all sampling locations was estimated at approximately 61,000 to 234,000 organisms m(-2) Overall, polychaetes comprised 57% of the infaunal community with Manayunkia aestuarina as the dominant species. Oligochaetes, nematodes, crustacea, insects, and gastropods comprised 23.0, 18.0, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.2% of the overall benthic community, respectively Density estimates of individual species between sampling locations showed no consistent patterns in response to pollutants. However, an analysis of higher taxonomic levels revealed some general trends. In uncontaminated areas, the benthic community was dominated by nematodes and oligochaetes, whereas moderate to highly contaminated areas were dominated by polychaetes and a smaller percentage of oligochaetes and nematodes. A trophic analysis of the same data set revealed that the community shifted from an evenly distributed percentage of surface and subsurface feeders in the uncontaminated areas to a community dominated by surface feeders in the more contaminated locations. Carnivores comprised from 0.13 to 0.90% of the trophic structure, with the percentage of carnivores generally decreasing with increasing contamination. Mercury and PCBs were bioaccumulating in representative marsh benthic invertebrates, presenting a potential source of contaminants to marsh consumers. Tissue PCB and tissue mercury concentrations were positively related to sediment PCB and mercury concentrations, respectively. A standard 14-day toxicity test using the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus showed no acute toxicity across the sampling locations.

TI  - Effects of Tidewater and Crab Burrowing on H2S Emission and Sulfur Storage in Spartina alterniflora Marsh
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to uncover the effects of tidewater and crab burrowing on sulfur cycling of Spartina alterniflora marsh, a field experiment was carried out at Jiangsu Yancheng Wetland National Nature Reserve. H2S flux, plant sulfur storage and total sulfur of sediments in S. alterniflora marsh were measured under different tidewater and crab burrows treatments. Results showed that crab burrows significantly increased H2S emission from S. alterniflora marsh, while no significant effect on H2S emission by tidewater was detected. Both tidewater and crab burrows had no significant effects on plant sulfur storage except that the crab burrows significantly decreased it in the seeding season. Tidewater only significantly impacted total sulfur in sediments of 0-30 cm depth, while those in soil of 0-20 and 40-50 cm depths were significantly affected by crab burrows. Total sulfur in sediments affected by tidewater and crab burrows exhibited a seasonal variation. The findings of this study indicated that both tidewater and crab burrowing were key disturbing factors affecting sulfur cycling in S. alterniflora marsh but in different aspects.

TI  - ARE SPARTINA MARSHES A REPLACEABLE RESOURCE - A FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH TO EVALUATION OF MARSH CREATION EFFORTS
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh creation has come into increasing use as a measure to mitigate loss of valuable wetlands.  However, few programs have addressed the functional ecological equivalence of man-made marshes and their natural counterparts.  This study addresses structural and functional interactions in a man-made and two natural marshes.  This was done by integrating substrate characteristics and marsh utilization by organisms of two trophic levels.  Sediment properties, infaunal community composition, and Fundulus heteroclitus marsh utilization were compared for a man-made Spartina salt marsh (between ages 1 to 3 yr) in Dills Creek, North Carolina, and adjacent natural marshes to the east and west.  East natural marsh and planted marsh sediment grain-size distributions were more similar to each other than to the west natural marsh due to shared drainage systems, but sediment organic content of the planted marsh was much lower than in either natural marsh.  This difference was reflected in macrofaunal composition.  Natural marsh sediments were inhabited primarily by subsurface, deposit-feeding oligochaetes whereas planted marsh sediments were dominated by the tube-building, surface-deposit feeding polychaetes Streblospio benedicti and Manayunkia aestuarina.  Infaunal differences were mirrored in Fundulus diets.  Natural marsh diets contained more detritus and insects because oligochaetes, though abundant, were relatively inaccessible.  Polychaetes and algae were major constituents of the planted marsh Fundulus diet.  Though natural-marsh fish may acquire a potentially less nutritive, detritus-based diet relative to the higher animal protein diet of the planted marsh fish, Fundulus abundances were markedly lower in the planted marsh than in the natural marshes, indicating fewer fish were being supported.  Lower Spartina stem densities in the planted marsh may have provided inadequate protection from predation or insufficient spawning sites for the fundulids.  After three years, the planted marsh remained functionally distinct from the adjacent natural marshes.  Mitigation success at Dills Creek could have been improved by increasing tidal flushing, thereby enhancing access to marine organisms and by mulching with Spartina wrack to increase sediment organic-matter content and porosity.  Results from this study indicate that salt marshes should not be treated as a replaceable resource in the short term.  The extreme spatial and temporal variability inherent to salt marshes make it virtually impossible to exactly replace a marsh by planting one on another site.

AB  - Analyses employing a petri-dish technique, which isolated sediments delivered by tidal waters, yielded a mean of 3.7% C for low-marsh habitats and 1.4% C for high-marsh habitats. The difference (P < 0.05) was attributed mainly to relative rates of deposition and in situ microbial production of C, as influenced by frequency of tidal inundation of respective substrates. The results compare closely with previous analyses of sediment cores from the same sites. These and other observations indicate that Georgia and similar Atlantic coast marshes are reservoirs for carbonaceous sediments and therefore are potential sources of hydrocarbons.

TI  - Forest Resource Islands in a Sub-tropical Marsh: Soil-Site Relationships in Everglades Hardwood Hammocks
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in soils is often characterized by the presence of resource-enriched patches ranging in size from a single shrub to wooded thickets. If the patches persist long enough, the primary constraint on production may transition from one limiting environmental factor to another. Tree islands that are scattered throughout the Florida Everglades basin comprise nutrient-enriched patches, or resource islands, in P-limited oligotrophic marshes. We used principal component analysis and multiple regressions to characterize the belowground environment (soil, hydrology) of one type of tree island, hardwood hammocks, and examined its relationship with the three structural variables (basal area, biomass, and canopy height) indicative of site productivity. Hardwood hammocks in the southern Everglades grow on two distinct soil types. The first, consisting of shallow, organic, relatively low-P soils, is common in the seasonally flooded Marl Prairie landscape. In contrast, hammocks on islands embedded in long hydroperiod marsh have deeper, alkaline, mineral soils with extremely high P concentrations. However, this edaphic variation does not translate simply into differences in forest structure and production. Relative water depth was unrelated to all measures of forest structure and so was soil P, but the non-carbonate component of the mineral soil fraction exhibited a strong positive relationship with canopy height. The development of P-enriched forest resource islands in the Everglades marsh is accompanied by the buildup of a mineral soil; however, limitations on growth in mature islands appear to differ substantively from those that dominate incipient stages in the transformation from marsh to forest.

TI  - Spatial distribution characteristics of organic matter and total nitrogen of marsh soils in river marginal wetlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Contents of soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface soils and subsurface soils were measured in five types of floodplains classified with different flood frequencies in river marginal wetlands of Erbaifangzi, China, in 1999. Contour maps and profile maps were constructed to describe the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in order to identify the influences of flood frequency on them. Results showed that spatial distributions of both SOM and TN were very similar in soil profiles (0-120 cm) of the five areas, decreasing gradually with depth except an accumulation peak in the flooded floodplain (B area). Also, the accumulation peak in the soil profile of B area was relevant to water table, nitrogen leaching, denitrification and mineralization. However, their horizontal distributions in surface soils (0-10 cm) were different in the five areas. Although the flood could bring the deposit of nutrients and sands, the highest content of SOM or TN did not appear in B area but in the floodplain with certain flood frequency. For example, SOM content (6.76%) in 5-year floodplain wetland was highest, and the highest content of TN (3666.4 mg/kg) appeared in 1-year floodplain wetland. However, SOM and TN contents in soils of B area were 4.08% and 2605.4 mg/kg, respectively. Soil clay content, wetland plant (Phragmites australis) litter inputs, soil moisture and water table greatly affected the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in floodplain wetlands. The ratios of carbon to nitrogen of wetland soils in this region were relatively lower than those in paddy soils. SOM and TN contents were significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) contents in floodplain wetlands except the 100-year floodplain wetland, but they were significantly influenced by soil pH values only in B area. Denitrification and ammonia volatilization were the main mechanisms resulting in nitrogen loss of surface soils in B area. Flood frequency significantly influenced the ecological functions such as nutrient retention and water quality maintenance of floodplains. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability in soil sulfur storage is changed by exotic Spartina alterniflora in the Jiuduansha Wetland, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an aim to determine whether Spartina alterniflora actively changes the habitat environment, thus facilitating its successful competition over native species, a field experiment was carried out at the Jiuduansha Wetland National Nature Reserve. Sulfur concentrations in the soil sediments were compared among wetlands dominated by the exotic Spartina alterniflora, the co-occurring native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. The results show that the soil sulfur concentrations in the Spartina alterniflora community showed significant spatiotemporal variability with the years since invasion. The S. alterniflora community contained the highest concentrations of sulfur in the soil sediment. Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths. In addition, the soil sulfur concentrations associated with S. alterniflora also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with depth, the soil sulfur concentrations in S. alterniflora soils were obviously higher than those in the S. mariqueter community and unvegetated mudflat, the maximum concentrations in S. alterniflora soils occurred at the depth of 40-60 cm. The findings of this study indicate that S. alterniflora increases wetland sulfur storage, which may explain the mechanism of expansion of S. alterniflora in the Jiuduansha Wetland.

AB  - Census data on benthic foraminiferal and thecamoebian tests in 52 surface sediment samples from Purakanui Inlet, Otago, New Zealand, are analyzed by cluster and correspondence analyses, Faunas are grouped into 10 sample associations with the following characterizing species: A) Trochammina inflata-at or above mean high water level in high salt meadow, salt marsh or grass; B) Jadammina macrescens/Trochammina inflata-at or above mean high-water level on the edge of high salt meadow; C) Trochamminita salsa-in sandy soil at around mean high-water spring, possibly influenced by fresh groundwater seepage; D) Pontigulasia compressa/Trochamminita salsa/Difflugia capreolata-at high tide level in the bed of the main freshwater stream flowing into the inlet; E) Haplophragmoides wilberti-in salt marsh and grass at mean high-water level on the edge of the inlet; F) Miliammina fusca-in Sarcocornia muddy, low salt meadow and sandy mud flats between mid and high tide levels; G) Elphidium excavatum-ver a wide area of tidal sand flats in the upper and middle parts of the inlet; H) Ammonia beccarii/Elphidium excavatum-in three areas of tidal sand hat in association with G, but with slightly lower salinity and nutrients; I) Elphidium excavatum/haynesina depressula-intertidally and subtidally around the inner end of the entrance channel in the vicinity of the flood tide sand delta; J) Zeaflorilus parri-intertidally and subtidally in the shallow, current swept entrance to the inlet, These correlate closely with the 8 species associations produced by cluster analysis.Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the following factors in decreasing order of importance are most influential in determining the faunal distribution: tidal exposure, salinity, percentage of mud, proximity of the open sea, organic carbon, phosphate and intertidal vegetation type.

TI  - Advective pore water input of nutrients to the Satilla River Estuary, Georgia, USA
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ benthic flux measurements, pore water nutrient profiles, water column nutrient distributions, sediment grain size distributions and side-scan sonar observations suggest that advective transport of pore waters may be a major input pathway of nutrients into the Satilla River Estuary (coastal Georgia, USA). In situ benthic chamber incubations demonstrate the occurrence of highly variable, but occasionally very large sea floor fluxes of silicate, phosphate, and ammonium. Locally occurring benthic microbial mineralization of organic matter, as estimated by S-35-sulphate reduction rate measurements, is insufficient to support these large fluxes. We hypothesize that the observed interlayering of permeable, sandy sediments with fine-grained, organic-rich sediments in the estuary provides conduits for advective transport of pore water constituents out of the sediments. Because permeable layers may extend significant distances beneath the salt marsh, the large fluxes observed may be supported by remineralization occurring over large areas adjacent to the estuary. Advective transport may be induced by pressure gradients generated by a variety of processes, including landward recharge by meteoric or rain waters if sand layers extend far enough into the maritime coastal lands. Alternatively, tidal variations across the salt marsh sediment surface may hydraulically pump water through the sediment system. Because these fluxes appear to be concentrated into small layers, this source may be a significant input of nutrients to the estuary even if permeable, sandy layers comprise a very small proportion of the seabed.

TI  - Formation of particulate organic carbon (POC) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in salt marsh estuaries of the southeastern United States
T2  - Ergebnisse der Limnologie
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Georgia rivers are significantly higher than the concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC). This dissolved organic matter (DOM) is shown to be composed mainly of DOC large than 10,000 dal, nominal molecular weight (NMW). The concentrations of this large molecular size fraction of the DOC appear to vary relative to river flow. Up to 25 % of the large molecular size carbon brought to the marshes by rivers form particulates when contacting the salinity gradients at the head of the estuaries. This newly formed POC has an enriched N/C ratio relative to riverine DOC. Concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are equal to or greater than inorganic nitrogen in these river systems indicating that DON may represent a significant source of nitrogen to heterotrophs in the estuaries. Annual flux of carbon as DOC and nitrogen as DON from the Georgia upland watersheds to the salt marsh estuaries is 23.6 +- 3.5 thousands of tonnes C and 11.3 +- 2.6 hundreds of tonnes N, respectively.

TI  - Relationships between spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment and halophytes zonation in salt marshes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the soil-plant relationships along the intertidal gradient from unvegetated mudflats to the ecotone between high marshes and coastal dunes. The main objective was to establish the integrated role of spatial and seasonal changes in the sedimentary abiotic environment in relation to the establishment of the halophytes zonation pattern. The sedimentary environment and the halophytes coverage were sampled bimonthly during a year in nine intertidal habitats characterized by different plant communities. The highest values of sediment water content (40-60%) and electrical conductivity (20-30 mS cm(-1)) were registered in low middle marshes, the highest organic matter content (ca. 23%) was found in middle marshes, and the highest pH (8.5-9.0) was recorded in high marshes. The conductivity and the pH of the marsh sediments changed seasonally. The sediment conductivity reached its highest values during spring and summer. The spatial variations in the sedimentary environment were closely associated with the distribution of most of the recorded halophytes, especially in low and high marshes where the abiotic environment was more stressful. At the same time, cyclical seasonal changes in conductivity seemed to determine the distribution of the halophytes in high marshes, where the seasonality was very marked under Mediterranean climate. The combination and integration over time of these spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment defined habitats with contrasted abiotic conditions parallel to the tidal line and complex abiotic mosaics inside some of these habitats, allowing the cohabitation of > 30 plant species along the intertidal gradient.

TI  - Superficial sedimentary stocks and sources of carbon and nitrogen in coastal vegetated assemblages along a flow gradient
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - STABLE CARBON-ISOTOPE SIGNATURES OF SEDIMENTARY CARBON IN COASTAL WETLANDS AS INDICATORS OF SALINITY REGIME
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable carbon isotope values of organic carbon have proven useful in identification of the salinity regime of marsh deposits in the Mississippi Delta plain. Using a mixing model and empirical measurements of the delta(13)C of marsh sediments, we show that carbon isotope analysis could be a useful technique on other coastlines. Estimates of the stable carbon isotope values from estuarine deposits along the west and east coast of the United States suggest that fresh and saline sediments each have a characteristic ''signature.'' Thus, stable carbon isotope values can provide valuable evidence of sea level fluctuations in these regions. Values of delta(13)C which depart from the predictive model could be caused by diagenetic processes (decomposition) and/or contribution from carbon sources not accounted for in the model. In assessing the relative importance of these factors, we find that complications are minimized when autochthonous carbon from algal production is not an important component of the sedimentary Organic matter.

TI  - Iron limitation of phytoplankton in an urbanized vs. forested southeastern US salt marsh estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, escalating rates of coastal development have altered macro- and micronutrient loading patterns to many southeastern U.S. estuaries. This study addresses a potential consequence of urbanization-associated coastal deforestation that may have important implications for estuarine ecosystem productivity: a reduction in bioavailable Fe. We compared the potential for Fe limitation at representative sites in two neighboring South Carolina salt marsh estuaries, one ("Parsonage Creek" site in Murrells Inlet estuary) impacted by urbanization-associated clear-cutting, and the other ("Oyster Landing" site in North Inlet estuary) undeveloped and surrounded by forests. The urbanized estuarine site was marked by lower dissolved Fe concentrations compared to the forested estuarine site. In bioassay experiments conducted from 1996 to 1999, the addition of chelated Fe to natural phytoplankton populations stimulated chlorophyll a concentrations in water from Parsonage Creek on 6 of 11 sampling dates. Chlorophyll responses in Oyster Landing water also were observed on two of those sampling times, dates that followed periods of relatively low rainfall. In one experiment, the addition of Fe+NO3- to Parsonage Creek water led to significantly higher chlorophyll concentrations than when NO3- was added alone, but Fe+NH4+ addition did not result in higher chlorophyll than NH4+ addition alone. It was hypothesized that the difference in NO3- and NH4+ responses was related to a greater tendency towards Si depletion in Fe-stressed NO3--grown samples, or alternatively, to the higher Fe requirement for NO3- assimilation relative to that needed for NH4+ assimilation. In bioassay experiments using Fe-deplete semi-continuous cultures of Synechococcus WH8101, Fe addition did not affect the net growth rate of cultures transferred to water from either estuary, but increased the chlorophyll a content of cells transferred to Parsonage Creek water. Finally, photosynthesis vs. irradiance parameters (alpha, P-max) obtained from Oyster Landing samples (< 2 mum size fraction) were similar to those measured in Fe-replete Synechococcus continuous cultures, while the same parameters derived from Parsonage Creek samples were much lower and comparable to those from Fe-deplete cultures. The results indicate that phytoplankton population growth from high salinity salt marsh estuaries can be Fe-limited. Also, the potential for Fe limitation was more prevalent in a urbanized deforested estuary than in an undeveloped forested estuary, consistent with the hypothesis that organically bound Fe from coastal forests plays an important role in supplying Fe for the growth of estuarine phytoplankton.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SEX AND MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ON GAS EXCHANGE IN THE DIOECIOUS SALT MARSH GRASS DISTICHLIS SPICATA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Premise of research. In dioecious plant species, males and females often differ in physiology, and mycorrhizal fungal relationships are likely to influence these differences. However, few data are available on the potential role of mycorrhizal fungi in altering sex-specific physiology and population sex ratios of dioecious plant species.Methodology. In this study, we measured leaf gas exchange in a multifactorial greenhouse experiment with and without mycorrhizal fungal additions and under field conditions in Distichlis spicata, a dioecious salt marsh grass, displaying extreme spatial sex ratio variation.Pivotal results. We found a significant interaction between gas exchange, plant sex, and mycorrhizal fungal infection. Specifically, females but not males had significantly lower transpiration rates and higher water use efficiency (WUE) in treatments with increased mycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, field data showed similar WU between plants at female-majority sites and male-majority sites, despite significantly lower rates of net assimilation and stomatal conductance in plants at female-majority sites.Conclusions. Our results suggest that the higher WUE associated with increased mycorrhizal fungi female D. spicata plants may be an important physiological attribute enabling female success in the higher-stress salt-water environment contributing to the spatial segregation of the sexes observed in this dioecious species.

T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY: CURRENT ADVANCES FROM GENOMICS, METAGENOMICS AND OTHER OMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The soil environment teems with microbes that play fundamental roles in controlling biogeochemical cycles, thus providing support for organisms above and below ground to thrive. With the contemporary development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, a growing body of literature has shown that organismal composition and abundance within microbial communities can orderly and sequentially change through time. Interestingly, these patterns of ecological succession share commonalities across distinct systems, e.g. receding glacier forelands, salt marsh chronosequence, volcanic deposited gradients, post-mining areas and abandoned agricultural fields. Of critical importance, most of the available literature is based on community taxa distribution, with relatively little known about the successional changes in community functional traits. Here, we provide an overview of advances in molecular methods based on DNA sequencing and describe how these methods can enhance our understanding of the dynamics of microbial communities, with particular implications for studying patterns of microbial succession in soils. Collectively, the use of molecular methods can promote a comprehensive understanding of how microbial communities systematically change over both spatial and temporal scales, thus providing the basis for predicting microbial community responses after short- and long-term disturbances and in future environmental change scenarios.

T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS

AB  - Soil aeration status in relation to water table was analyzed by contour mapping in a forested wetland, an emergent marsh, and an irrigated rice field. Two soil aeration status indicators, oxygen (O-2 ) and redox potential (Eh), showed a significant correlation (P < 0.01). Soil O-2 and Eh levels generally decreased with the water table rise in the forested wetland and marsh, but with a noncontinuous pattern. The results indicate that soil aeration status could be temporally improved at an optimum water table level, probably due to O2 transport by wetland plants. The soil Eh in the rice fields clearly showed a seasonal pattern regardless of the water tables.

TI  - Carbon flux between an estuary and the ocean: A case for outwelling
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The classical outwelling hypothesis states that small coastal embayments (e.g. estuaries, wetlands) export their excess production to inshore marine waters. In line with this notion, the present study tested whether the Swartkops estuary acts as source or sink for carbon. To this end, concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined hourly during the first monthly spring and neap tides over one year in the tidal waters entering and leaving the estuary. Each sampling session spanned a full tidal cycle, yielding a total of 936 concentration estimates. Carbon fluxes were calculated by integrating concentrations with water flow rates derived from a hydrodynamic model calibrated for each sampling datum. Over the year, exports to marine waters markedly exceeded imports to the estuary for all carbon species: on the basis of total spring tidal drainage area, 1083 g m(-2) of DIC, 103 g m(-2) of DOC, and 123 g m(-2) of POC left the estuary annually. Total carbon export from the estuary to the ocean amounted to 4755 tonnes, of which 83% was in the inorganic form (DIG). Thus, the bulk of carbon moving in the water column is inorganic - yet, DIC seems to be measured only rarely in most flux studies of this nature. Salt marshes cover extensive areas in this estuary and produce some carbon, particularly DOG, but productivity of the local Spartina species is low (P:B = 1.1). Consequently, the bulk of carbon exported from the estuary appears to originate from the highly productive macroinvertebrate and the phytoplankton component and not from the salt marsh plants.

TI  - Fluorescence characterization of daily and intertidal changes in estuarine water DOM related to the presence of Sarcocornia perennis (L.) AJ Scott
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Sarcocornia perennis on the DOM quantity and its nature in the water column was evaluated by way of UV-visible and molecular fluorescence spectroscopy. Different light conditions occur along the night and the day periods, while, in parallel, flooding conditions vary along consecutive tidal cycles. Thus, a 24 hour field assessment was carried out in order to encompass the daily (day/night) and intertidal (high/low tide) variations. The E(2):E(3) ratio and spectral slope (S) from UV-visible spectra pointed to an export of compounds of high molecular weight (MW) to surface waters during the tidal ebbing at the colonized site. Furthermore, three main types of fluorescent compounds were found in the water synchronous fluorescence spectra: one corresponding to protein-like compounds and two to humic-like compounds. Fluorescence intensity increased during tidal ebbing, both during the day and during the night and especially for water from the colonized site. However, major increases occurred for the protein-like fluorescence band at the S. perennis colonized site during the nocturnal tide ebbing, which may be related to the activity of plants at the rhizosphere.

TI  - THE DISTRIBUTION AND STABLE CARBON ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON IN ESTUARIES
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the natural carbon isotope ratio of DOC (DOC)-C-13 in estuaries reflect the predominant sources and sinks of organic matter from both allochthonous and autochthonous origins. The traditional view is that DOC in land-margin ecosystems reflects mainly the mixing of land-derived and oceanic DOC. However, this view is not consistent with the bulk of our data from a survey of DOC and (DOC)-C-13 distributions in estuaries on the East and Gulf coasts of the USA. While it is accurate that the DOC in estuaries includes material derived from land and from the ocean, the distributions of DOC and (DOC)-C-13 in several estuaries reflect additional DOC inputs from estuarine phytoplankton and tidal marshes. Even when DOC concentrations were distributed conservatively, the isotopic composition of the DOC revealed the existence of a dynamic cycle of DOC input and removal in some systems.

TI  - Impact of land-use change and hard structures on the evolution of fringing marsh shorelines
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine fringe marshes provide essential ecosystem services to coastal regions, including carbon sequestration and provision of shelter and nursery grounds for aquatic and terrestrial animals. The ability of a marsh to sustain itself by vertical accretion in response to sea-level rise is, in part, limited by inorganic sediment supply. Models attempting to forecast salt-marsh response to future sea-level rise commonly ignore land-use changes, despite the recent coastal population boom and the potential of land-use changes to alter sediment sources and modify established sediment-transport pathways. This study investigates the impacts of landscape modifications, which are typical of coastal areas, on the nearshore sedimentation and edge evolution of two fringing marshes. The sites examined include a marsh fringing the upper bay and a marsh fringing a beach ridge on the estuarine shoreline of a barrier island. Both sites are located in the same estuarine system, have similar hydrologic settings and comparable vegetation densities. Previous work, marsh cores, and a historical record from aerial photos indicate that although the fringe marshes are in different geomorphic locations, prior to anthropogenic modifications they were similar in terms of nearshore-sediment composition, scarp-shoreline morphology, and shoreline trajectory. The upper-bay marsh was impacted by the introduction of tree farming in the watershed of a tributary creek to the upper bay, which increased upland erosion and caused higher sedimentation rates in the estuary. The back-barrier marsh, which received no contribution from the tree farm because it is distal with respect to river input, was modified by the installation of a pier and rock sill. Terrestrial LIDAR, surface elevation tables, and accretion rates obtained from radioisotope analyses show that the deforestation induced high rates of nearshore and marsh accretion at the upper-bay site, which is promoting marsh colonization and expansion. These same types of data, in addition to aerial photos, were obtained at the back-barrier site and show increased rates of marsh-shoreline erosion adjacent to the structures. The fringing marshes were once similar, but started to evolve differently over a short time period as a result of human-induced changes to the landscape. Coastal development can significantly influence marsh-shoreline behavior, which must be taken into account when developing models of coastal response to sea-level rise. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sediment quality in the Douro river estuary based on trace metal contents, macrobenthic community and elutriate sediment toxicity test (ESTT)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the sediment quality in the mesotidal Douro River estuarine environment, in order to identify areas where sediment contamination could cause ecosystem degradation. Samples were obtained in five locations and sediment characterised for grain size, total organic matter, total-recoverable metals (Al, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn and Mn), as well as acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM). In situ effects were evaluated by examining the macrobenthic community structure. An elutriate sediment toxicity test (ESTT) was used to estimate the amount of metals and nutrients that could be exchanged with the water column through resuspension, and its positive or negative effects on the growth of the micro-alga Emiliania huxleyi in a 10 day test. Anthropogenic metal contamination was identified at the north bank of the Douro estuary, with deleterious effects on the macrobenthic community, namely decrease in number of species and diversity. This contamination could possibly also be toxic for water column organisms, in case of resuspension, as shown by the ESTT. Sediments from the salt marsh at the south bank showed an impoverished macrobenthic community and elutriate toxicity, which appeared to be due to anaerobic conditions. This study clearly shows the usefulness of the ESST approach to assess the biological effect of resuspension of estuarine sediments.

TI  - Hydrochemical Characteristics Jointly Determine the Transport and Cycling of Soil Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus in an Arid Chinese Wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt accumulation gradually changes the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and may even transform sinks into sources in arid wetlands. However, it's not clear how hydrochemical characteristics affect the wetland's source or sink function or how they affect C, N, and P cycling in arid regions. To clarify these relationships, we conducted field measurement in arid northern China. We simulated the variations of hydrochemical characteristics and the storage and stoichiometry of C, N, and P using the process-based DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Hydrus-1D models. The meteorological and hydrological processes had obvious characteristics of seasonal and interannual changes. The measured evapotranspiration averaged 660.23 and 587.94 mm year(-1)in the saltmarsh and riparian wetlands, respectively. The soil showed a clear trend with higher SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl(-)fractions in comparison with lower Mg2+, K+, and HCO(3)(-)fractions, with the major ion and nutrient concentrations gradually decreasing with increasing depth in the soil. The major ion types had characteristics of Na+-Ca2+-SO42--Cl(-)in the saltmarsh wetland and riparian wetland. The storage of total C, N, and P were 372.72 +/- 66.52 t C/hm(2), 10.92 +/- 2.59 t N/hm(2), and 17.55 +/- 1.54 t P/hm(2)in the saltmarsh wetland versus 119.72 +/- 27.88 t C/hm(2), 4.38 +/- 1.24 t N/hm(2), and 13.17 +/- 1.46 t P/hm(2)in the riparian wetland. Therefore, wetland salinization in our study led to increased soil C, N, and P contents and storage and thereby enhanced the sink function of the wetlands.

TI  - Phragmites australis meets Suaeda salsa on the "red beach": Effects of an ecosystem engineer on salt-marsh litter decomposition
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa is a pioneer species in coastal wetlands of East Asia and recently an ecosystem engineer species, Phragmites australis, has started to enter into S. salsa communities owing to either autogenic or external drivers. The consequences of this phenomenon on the ecosystem functions of coastal wetlands are still unclear, especially for decomposition processes. Here we compared the decomposition rate of S. salsa litter, and associated litter chemistry dynamics, between sites with and without P. australis encroachment. We conducted a litter transplantation experiment to tease apart the effects of litter quality and decomposing environment or decomposer community composition. Our results showed that P. australis encroachment led to higher carbon and phosphorus losses of S. salsa litter, but equal losses of total mass, lignin, hemicellulose and nitrogen. Phragmites australis encroachment might affect decomposition rate indirectly by making S. salsa produce litter with higher lignin concentrations or via increasing the fungal diversity for decomposition. Moreover, P. australis as an ecosystem engineer might also alter the allocation of total phosphorus between the plants and the soils in coastal wetlands. Our findings indicate that P. australis could impact aboveground and belowground carbon and nutrient dynamics in coastal wetlands, and highlight the important consequences that encroaching plant species, especially ecosystem engineers, can have on ecosystem functions and services of coastal wetlands, not only in East Asia but probably also elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Simulating Spatial Variation of Soil Carbon Content in the Yellow River Delta: Comparative Analysis of Two Artificial Neural Network Models
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A reasonable predicting model for spatial variation of soil carbon would be a useful tool in monitoring and restoration of salt marshes. In this study, radial basis function neural networks model (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks model (BPNN) were built to predict total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. Both models contained thirteen input parameters, i.e., nine topographic factors selected from ASTER GDEM Version2 and Geographical Information System (GIS), one vegetation index - MODIS 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and three soil physicochemical properties. For prediction of TC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 61.87%, 81.36% and 56.82%; for TOC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 37.13%, 58.06% and 35.23%; both models had no significant difference in accuracy for DOC prediction, but the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller. All ME values of RBFNN rather than BPNN were closer to zero. RBFNN integrating environmental factors had a higher accuracy than BPNN in predicting soil carbon content at a relatively small regional scale.

TI  - How Does Mangrove Expansion Affect Structure and Function of Adjacent Seagrass Meadows?
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperatures are increasing globally and causing species-specific geographic range expansions. In the Gulf of Mexico, mangroves are encroaching regions historically dominated by temperate salt marshes, changing animal communities and nutrient cycling in the intertidal zone. Marine systems are highly connected; therefore, we expect that changes in the intertidal will alter functions of adjacent subtidal seagrass meadows. We surveyed seagrass meadows adjacent to mangroves, salt marshes, and a mixture of the two and asked, do changes in intertidal plant composition influence (1) environmental conditions (subtidal water and sediment characteristics); (2) biogeochemical cycling (net oxygen and nitrogen gas fluxes); (3) seagrass meadow cover, biomass, and productivity; and (4) invertebrate community assemblage? There are clear differences in sediment organic matter and net nitrogen gas (N-2) fluxes between adjacent intertidal habitats, but the magnitude or direction of change differs seasonally. We hypothesize that this seasonal pattern is due to outwelling from the intertidal, as mangroves senesce in fall, and marshes senesce later in winter. Therefore, changes in adjacent intertidal habitat can impact the timing of organic matter delivery. This also has implications for seagrass biomass. Thalassia testudinum belowground biomass adjacent to mangroves substantially decreased over the winter, suggesting vulnerability to stressors as the intertidal plant community shifts from marsh to mangrove dominance. Epifauna density and diversity did not vary among seagrass meadows based on adjacent intertidal habitats, but subtle differences in community assemblages associated with shifts in intertidal plant community were detected. This work demonstrates that impacts of species range expansions are far-reaching due to connectivity in marine systems.

TI  - Holocene vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and hydrological processes in the Bohai region
T2  - CLIMATE OF THE PAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal vegetation both mitigates the damage inflicted by marine disasters on coastal areas and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle (i.e., blue carbon). Nevertheless, detailed records of changes in coastal vegetation composition and diversity in the Holocene, coupled with climate change and river evolution, remain unclear. To explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors on the coastal area of the Bohai Sea (BS) during the Holocene, we present high-resolution pollen and sediment grain size data obtained from a sediment core of the BS. The results reveal that two rapid and abrupt changes in salt marsh vegetation are linked with the river system changes. Within each event, a recurring pattern - starting with a decline in Cyperaceae, followed by an increase in Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae - suggests a successional process that is determined by the close relationship between Yellow River (YR) channel shifts and the wetland community dynamics. The phreatophyte Cyperaceae at the base of each sequence indicate lower saline conditions. Unchannelized river flow characterized the onset of the YR channel shift, caused a huge river-derived sediment accumulation in the floodplain and destroyed the sedges in the coastal depression. Along with the formation of a new channel, lateral migration of the lower channel stopped, and a new intertidal mudflat was formed. Pioneer species (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) were the first to colonize the bare zones of the lower and middle marsh areas. In addition, the pollen results revealed that the vegetation of the BS land area was dominated by broadleaved forests during the Early Holocene (8500-6500 BP) and by conifer and broadleaved forests in the Middle Holocene (6500-3500 BP), which was followed by an expansion of broadleaved trees (after 3500 BP). The pollen record indicated that a warmer Early and Late Holocene and colder Middle Holocene were consistent with previously reported temperature records for East Asia. The main driving factors of temperature variation in this region are insolation, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and greenhouse gases forcing.

TI  - Cumulative nitrogen input drives species loss in terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Elevated inputs of biologically reactive nitrogen (N) are considered to be one of the most substantial threats to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Several attempts have been made to scrutinize the factors driving species loss following excess N input, but generalizations across sites or vegetation types cannot yet be made. Here we focus on the relative importance of the vegetation type, the local environment (climate, soil pH, wet deposition load) and the experimentally applied (cumulative) N dose on the response of the vegetation to N addition.Location Mainly North America and Europe.Methods We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of in situ N addition experiments in different vegetation types, focusing on the response of biomass and species richness.Results Whereas the biomass of grasslands and salt marshes significantly increased with N fertilization, forest understorey vegetation, heathlands, freshwater wetlands and bogs did not show any significant response. Graminoids significantly increased in biomass following N addition, whereas bryophytes significantly lost biomass; shrubs, forbs and lichens did not significantly respond. The yearly N fertilization dose significantly influenced the biomass response of grassland and salt marshes, while for the other vegetation types none of the collected predictor variables were of significant influence. Species richness significantly decreased with N addition in grasslands and heathlands [Correction added on 23 March 2011, after first online publication: 'across all vegetation types' changed to 'in grasslands and heathlands']. The relative change in species richness following N addition was significantly driven by the cumulative N dose.Main conclusions The decline in species richness with cumulative N input follows a negative exponential pathway. Species loss occurs faster at low levels of cumulative N input or at the beginning of the addition, followed by an increasingly slower species loss at higher cumulative N inputs. These findings lead us to stress the importance of including the cumulative effect of N additions in calculations of critical load values.

TI  - When liming and revegetation contribute to the mobilisation of metals: Learning lessons for the phytomanagement of metal-polluted wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of liming in combination with vegetation for the recovery of slightly acidic, saline soils of eutrophic wetlands affected by mine wastes, under fluctuating flooding conditions. Simulated soil profiles were constructed and four treatments were assayed under greenhouse conditions: control, only plant, only liming, and liming and plant. The plant species was the halophyte Sarcocornia fruticosa. Three horizons were differentiated: A (never under water), C1 (alternating flooding-drying conditions), and C2 (always under water). The pH, Eh, salinity, and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and soluble metals were measured regularly for 18 weeks. Liming favoured the growth of S. fruticosa, an increase in pH and a fall in Eh. The amendment was effective for reducing Mn, Zn, and Cd in pore water of bare soils, but not Cu and Pb. In the treatment with liming and plant, the growth of S. fruticosa counteracted the effect of the amendment, strongly increasing the concentrations of metals in pore water and distributing them along the soil profile. Hence, the combined use of liming and plants may increase the risk of metals mobilisation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Structural Adaptation of Deverra tortuosa (Desf.) DC. to Its Natural Habitats in Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - DEVERRA tortuosa (Desf.) DC. is a common medicinal, grazing, and salt-tolerant desert plant that can grow in a variety of habitats. The current study aims to detect anatomical adaptation to stress factors in different organs of the D.tortuosa plant (salinity, and drought). The plant was collected in Egypt from 17 different locations representing seven different habitats (sand dunes, sand flats, salt marshes, wadi bed & slope, roadsides and cultivated lands). The effect of soil factors (soil texture, pH, EC, and organic matter) on the anatomical features of various plant organs (root, stem, and leaf) was investigated. Variations in plant anatomical features were observed in response to significant differences in soil parameters (EC, organic carbon, and ionic content) between desert habitats. According to CCA analysis, periderm thickness is correlated with changes in ion concentrations (Ca+2, K+, and Na+), whereas cortex width is correlated with changes in pH and organic matter content in roots. Meanwhile, the degree of salinity in the habitats is correlated with sclerification in the stem and the widest chlorenchyma cells. Thick epidermis and a large xylem area are required for salt excretion in leaf development, and water conservation is related to changes in moisture content. Reducing plant water loss in the studied desert habitats could explain D. tortuosa's successful growth and survival under such harsh conditions.

TI  - The contribution of leaching to the rapid release of nutrients and carbon in the early decay of wetland vegetation
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal was to quantify the coupled process of litter turnover and leaching as a source of nutrients and fixed carbon in oligotrophic, nutrient-limited wetlands. We conducted poisoned and non-poisoned incubations of leaf material from four different perennial wetland plants (Eleocharis spp., Cladium jamaicense, Rhizophora mangle and Spartina alterniflora) collected from different oligotrophic freshwater and estuarine wetland settings. Total phosphorus (TP) release from the P-limited Everglades plant species (Eleocharis spp., C. jamaicense and R. mangle) was much lower than TP release by the salt marsh plant S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet (SC). For most species and sampling times, total organic carbon (TOC) and TP leaching losses were much greater in poisoned than non-poisoned treatments, likely as a result of epiphytic microbial activity. Therefore, a substantial portion of the C and P leached from these wetland plant species was bio-available to microbial communities. Even the microbes associated with S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet showed indications of P-limitation early in the leaching process, as P was removed from the water column. Leaves of R. mangle released much more TOC per gram of litter than the other species, likely contributing to the greater waterborne [DOC] observed by others in the mangrove ecotone of Everglades National Park. Between the two freshwater Everglades plants, C. jamaicense leached nearly twice as much P than Eleocharis spp. In scaling this to the landscape level, our observed leaching losses combined with higher litter production of C. jamaicense compared to Eleocharis spp. resulted in a substantially greater P leaching from plant litter to the water column and epiphytic microbes. In conclusion, leaching of fresh plant litter can be an important autochthonous source of nutrients in freshwater and estuarine wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizas in Jaumea carnosa, a tidal saltmarsh halophyte
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 Jaumea carnosa (Less.) Gray was studied in three environmentally distinct regions of the Walker Creek marsh, California. This species was mycorrhizal at an upland site removed from tidal influences except when extreme tides coincided with winter precipitation, a tidal channel site, and a waterlogged marine site (pioneer zone). The percentage of root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (%AM) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the upland site (approximate to 7%), compared to either the channel (approximate to 28%) or marine sites (approximate to 17%).2 The vertical distribution of AM in the 40-cm rooting profile of Jaumea was, in most cases, positively associated (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01) with gravimetric soil moisture. Surprisingly, redox potential did not have a negative effect on AM. AM colonization levels were often > 20% in regions of the soil profile where redox potentials were less than 100 mV and soil moisture levels exceeded 120%.3 Cross-sections of host plant roots revealed the localization of arbuscules in the radial files of aerenchymatous tissue which may facilitate the survival of AM fungi in reduced soils. Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith was the dominant sporulating species from the marine site soils, while several undescribed species of Glomus dominated the channel and upland site soils. Species composition was similar in soil samples collected during dry (September) and wet (January) months.4 In the upland site, %AM may be suppressed by the osmotic stresses associated with seasonal extremes of salinity. For the upland and channel sites, %AM and arbuscule frequencies were greatest during the winter months of December and early March, when plants were relatively dormant. In these sites, vesicles and hyphae were most abundant during the summer months. In the waterlogged and reduced soils of the marine site, AM levels did not change seasonally despite high levels of available phosphorus.5 In the channel site, the tidal deposition of nitrogen-rich (and possibly spore-bearing) sediments, the presence of faunal activity in channel walls, and improved soil aeration associated with tidal inundation and retreat are among the proposed explanations for mycorrhizal abundance in this location of the Walker Creek marsh.

TI  - Characterization of dissolved organic matter from a restored urban marsh and its role in the mobilization of trace metals
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM), although highly variable and not very well characterized, plays a role in many important environmental reaction and transport processes, including trace metal mobilization. This study characterizes heterogeneous DOM from the pore-water of a restored urban tidal marsh, using chemical, optical, and electrochemical methods for dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen ratios (C:N: 1.8-6.4), spectroscopic characteristics (decreased aromaticity in amended sediments), element ratios (maximum sediment-associated trace metal concentrations measured <30 cm), and metal complexation properties (logK(c),: Cd: 10.7 +/- 0.7 > Pb: 9.5 +/- 0.1 > Cr: 7.3 +/- 0.1 > Cu: 5.07 +/- 0.53), all as a function of sediment depth.Specific DOM properties from the restored marsh were then compared to pore-water samples from a natural marsh and a simulated wetland microcosm which resulted in similar values, while the reference humic acid significantly differed in properties from field DOM. The results revealed that reference humic acids do not accurately represent the complexity of natural heterogeneous DOM, whereas a simulated wetland microcosm may provide a reasonable representation of natural DOM.Clear differences between amended and original soil (transition below 30 cm) were observed in DOM and trace metal properties including: lower DOM content, higher logK(c) values, less DOM complexity, development of a iron-sulfide redox buffering pool, and greater affinity for metals in the solid phase occurring in the amended sediments.

TI  - Response of growth and density of a population of Geukensia demissa to land-derived nitrogen loading, in Waquoit bay, Massachusetts
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient enrichment is a widespread phenomenon affecting coastal waters, including salt marshes. As land-derived nitrogen loading in estuarine waters increases, chlorophyll concentrations in the water also increase. We hypothesized that such increases might increase growth of the food-limited population of Geukensia demissa, which is a dominant component of salt marshes. To test this, we conducted a regional scale experiment in three estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts that receive different nitrogen loading rates. A stable isotope experiment on mussel tissues and on particulate organic matter (POM) showed that mussels within an estuary fed on POM characteristic of that estuary, demonstrating the direct linkage between POM and mussels within an estuary. In addition, we measured age-specific shell growth rates of mussel populations using two different methods: indirectly, shell growth of mussels indicated by internal shell-lines was measured by fitting the data to the von Bertalanffy equation, and directly, mussels were transplanted from one estuary to the other two, and their actual shell growth rates after 80 days were measured. Growth rates of mussels in the Waquoit Bay estuaries varied with age of the mussel, tidal elevation, and with mean concentration of chlorophyll in the water. Mussels grew best in the lower intertidal zone, at the marsh banks. Young mussels grew faster than older mussels. Growth rates increased in response to presumed greater food supply across the estuaries, only for younger mussels. The significant differences we found among the mussels from different estuaries indicate a response to higher concentrations of food particles available in estuaries subject to higher nitrogen loads.

TI  - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ORGANIC-MATTER DEGRADATION IN THE INTERPRETATION OF HISTORICAL POLLUTION TRENDS IN-DEPTH PROFILES OF ESTUARINE SEDIMENT
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative significance of organic matter degradation in bringing about the early diagenetic mobility of anthropogenic trace metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) is assessed specifically in relation to the use of estuarine sediments as historical records of pollution. A 1,500 mm salt-marsh sediment depth profile from Tites Point, Severn Estuary, England, was sampled at 10-mm intervals. Organic carbon determinations were carried out by a wet oxidation technique, and 'organic fraction' metals were separated by sequential leaching. Results demonstrated that organic phase metals are quantitatively significant in Severn Estuary sediments, particularly Cu and Zn (Cu > Zn), and that metals are probably released from this fraction during early diagenesis. The degree of release, and the apparent loss of the released trace metals from the sediment, would suggest that the use of estuarine sediments as historical records of pollution requires qualification.

TI  - Influence of soil properties on trace element availability and plant accumulation in a Mediterranean salt marsh polluted by mining wastes: Implications for phytomanagement
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the factors which control metal and As phytoavailability in the different microenvironments (Sand Dunes, Salt Flat, Dry River and Shrubs) present at a Mediterranean salt marsh polluted by mining wastes. We performed a field study following a plot sampling survey. The analyses of soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon contents, etc.), total metal and As concentrations and their phytoavailability assessed with EDTA were related to each microenvironment and the corresponding plant species uptake. The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. However the highest metal and As shoot concentrations occurred in species from the Sand Dunes: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As similar to 270 mg kg(-1) Pb for Dittrichia viscosa: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 390 mg kg(-1) Zn for Crucianella maritima. The occurrence of edaphic gradients including salinity and texture determined the vegetation distribution. However, it cannot be concluded that there was a disturbance due to metal(loid)s soil concentrations in terms of vegetation composition except in the Degraded Dunes and Dry River. The higher EDTA-extractable concentrations were coincidental with the most saline soils but this did not result in higher metal(loid)s plant accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - POREWATER DRAINAGE AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON AND NUTRIENT LOSSES THROUGH THE INTERTIDAL CREEKBANKS OF A NEW-ENGLAND SALT-MARSH
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage of interstitial water from creekbanks vegetated by tall Spartina alterniflora was directly measured using an in situ chamber technique over complete tidal cycles throughout the year in the Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Massachusetts, USA. Estimates of porewater seepage into chambers compared favorably with water exchange calculated from parallel measurements of water table excursion and sediment-specific yield when plants were inactive. Upon low tide exposure of the marsh surface, there was an initial large loss of porewater, then a continuously declining discharge which paralleled the pattern of water table drop in the adjacent creekbank sediments. Seepage losses were related to the vertical height of the creekbank with banks ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m showing more than a 3-fold greater discharge than those only 0.25 to 0.5 m high on a linear basis and nearly 2-fold greater on an areal basis. Strong seasonal variations in seepage volume and extent of low tide water table excursion occurred in the tall S. alterniflora zone. In summer when water removal was through both drainage and evapotranspiration, the water table fell at almost twice the rate as in winter when drainage predominated. The annually averaged volume of creekbank seepage was 15.2 l m(-2) or 8.9 l m(-1) per tide. The magnitude of the seepage pathway for organic matter and nutrient export from marsh sediments was assessed from simultaneous measurements of seepage volume and concentrations of DOC, NH4+, NO3-+NO2-, and PO43- in both seepage and tidal waters. Sediments underlying tall S. alterniflora showed a net export of DOC of 1080 mmol C m(-2) yr(-1) (544 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), NH4+ 115 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) (57 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), and NO3-+NO2- 6.5 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) (4.7 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), while PO43- was imported from tidal waters. Measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen losses in drainage waters represent only about 3% of the inorganic nitrogen export from this marsh. While porewater drainage was a major factor in the water budget of creekbank areas and represents a potential aeration subsidy to sediment oxidation, it was not found to be a significant pathway for the transfer of organic carbon or inorganic nutrients from the Spartina root zone to tidal waters.

TI  - Effect of livestock on soil structure and chemistry in the coastal marshes of the central Gulf Coast of Mexico
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on earth because of their high ecological and economic value. On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved. The results of this study should be considered in the development of strategies for the management and conservation of these tropical ecosystems, as a means to achieve sustainable livestock farming in wetlands.

TI  - Tidal restoration of a managed wetland in California favors non-native fishes
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetland restoration is commonly used to recover ecosystem functions and services that were lost when wetlands were diked for reclamation or management. Less research has been conducted on the response of invertebrate and fish assemblages to tidal restoration than on plants and physical attributes. Blacklock Marsh, a wetland in Suisun Marsh, USA, was once managed for waterfowl hunting and cattle grazing until its dike was breached, restoring full tidal action. We sampled water quality, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in Blacklock Marsh, and compared these metrics to adjacent naturalistic waterways and to a managed wetland focused on waterfowl. Our goal was to compare food production and community assemblage on a restoring marsh to other types of nearby waterways. Blacklock Marsh had less chlorophyll-a and dissolved organic carbon than nearby dead-end sloughs and the managed wetland, less zooplankton biomass than the managed wetland, and lower fish diversity-with a fish assemblage dominated by non-native species-compared to all other waterways. The most abundant fish species in the restoring site, Mississippi silverside (Menidia audens), is a non-native fish and known predator of Delta smelt larvae (Hypomesus transpacificus), for which the restoration was targeted. Our research suggests that restoring tidal action to managed wetlands alone may worsen rather than improve conditions for at-risk and native fishes.

TI  - Flow discharge influences on input and transport of particulate and sedimentary organic carbon along a small temperate river
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of hydrological conditions and upstream processes on the input and transport of organic carbon from land to sea was investigated in the Mullica River, a small system located in the southeastern New Jersey (USA), using molecular and delta C-13 compositions. Sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) samples were collected along the river, from upstream (draining predominantly pine-oak forests) in the Pinelands to the Great Bay Estuary (bordered by salt marshes) under normal and high flow conditions. During base river flow, terrestrial biomarkers (e.g., diterpenoids - conifer biomarkers) were detected predominantly upstream and sharply decreased downstream. From mid to down river sites, a mixture of higher plants (primarily from the salt marsh vegetation) and microbial biomarkers (e.g., mycose, cholesterol) predominated. delta C-13 abundances of individual fatty acids presented a consistent pattern, with depleted values (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -30.9 parts per thousand on average) upstream, becoming heavier toward the Great Bay (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -23.1 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -22.8 parts per thousand). During the high discharge event, significant amounts of upland biomarkers (e.g., pimaric acid, ferruginol, ursolic acid) and depleted delta C-13 values were observed from the Pinelands (delta C-13(sed) = -34.6 parts per thousand) to mid river (delta C-13(sed) = -32.0 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -30.8 parts per thousand), clearly demonstrating the transport of terrestrial material farther down river. However, downstream of this point, the occurrence of the terrestrial material strongly decreased, demonstrating that terrestrial plant biomarkers were not transported in significant amounts to the estuarine region, even at high river discharge. Since the mid river site is situated in the upper limit of salt water intrusions, it is likely that flocculation and sedimentation provide a depositional sink for terrestrial OC in the mid Mullica River, thereby depleting the terrigenous signature in downstream OC.

TI  - Elevated nutrient inputs to marshes differentially impact carbon and nitrogen cycling in two northern Gulf of Mexico saltmarsh plants
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh biogeochemical processes are regulated by ecosystem structure (e.g. plant community composition). However, plant-specific responses to stressors such as elevated nutrient inputs can have differing impacts on nitrogen (N) removal and carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted a field manipulation to investigate the impact of elevated nutrient loading on ecosystem C dynamics and nitrate reduction pathways (denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) in plots dominated by either Juncus roemerianus or Spartina alterniflora that were collocated in a northern Gulf of Mexico salt marsh. We increased N and phosphorus (P) inputs by two- and three-times current levels in the region. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on net ecosystem exchange. However, a three-fold increase in nutrient input resulted in nearly one-third increases in gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration in S. alterniflora plots, whereas there was no impact in J. roemerianus plots. Denitrification increased in S. alterniflora plots tenfold at both treatment levels relative to controls, but as with GPP, there was no response in J. roemerianus plots to higher nutrient inputs. In contrast, a three-fold increase in nutrients reduced DNRA by half in J. roemerianus plots. This work demonstrates that plant species-specific responses in marshes need to be considered for determining the impact of higher nutrient inputs on plant productivity and N-removal and retention.

TI  - Living shorelines enhance nitrogen removal capacity over time
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Living shorelines are nature-based solutions to coastal erosion that can be constructed as salt marshes with fringing oyster reefs. Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0-20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxe (N-2 and O-2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management.

AB  - Measurements of O-2, Fe(II), Mn(II) and HS- in salt marsh sediments in the Tagus Estuary, Portugal, made with a voltammetric microelectrode, reveal strong seasonal differences in pore water composition within the 20 cm deep root zone. In spring, oxygen was below detection limit except close to the sediment surface. Fe( II) was present below 5 cm in concentrations ranging from detection limit to 1700 muM. In summer, oxygen was present in the pore water almost to the bottom of the root zone in concentrations ranging from detection limit to more than 100 muM. The spatial variability was intense: O-2 concentrations as high as 78 muM and as low as 25 muM existed within 2 mm of each other. Fe(II) was below detection limit except towards the bottom of the root zone. In late fall, oxygen was found to 8 cm depth, but in concentrations lower than in summer, and Fe(II) was present below 9 cm. Mn(II) was found at levels declining from typical values of 200 muM in spring to less than 20 muM in late fall. With one exception, sulfide was below the detection limit in all measurements. During periods when dissolved Fe(II) is available in the pore water at the same time as O-2 is delivered by roots, iron-rich concretions can form on roots. These conditions, which lead to precipitation of iron oxide in the sediment adjacent to roots, exist in spring, when new roots infiltrate anoxic Fe(II) containing sediment. They do not exist in summer, when dissolved Fe( II) is unavailable, or in winter, when oxygen is unavailable. The seasonal redox pattern revealed by the pore water chemistry is driven by the annual cycle of growth and decay of roots.

TI  - Sediment characteristics of a restored saltmarsh and mudflat in a managed realignment scheme in Southeast England
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment characteristics and vegetation composition were measured in a restored and natural saltmarsh and mudflat at Wallasea Island managed realignment scheme (Essex, UK) from January to December 2007. The similar sediment characteristics in the restored and natural mudflat indicated that the sediment in the restored mudflat was approaching natural conditions. However, the sediment characteristics in the restored saltmarsh were not becoming similar to those in the natural saltmarsh. The sediment moisture content, organic matter content and porosity were lower while the sediment bulk density, salinity and pH were higher in the restored compared to the natural saltmarsh. The dissimilarities were mainly due to differences in the vegetation abundance and organic matter content. Although, 18 months after restoration the restored saltmarsh was only sparsely vegetated and there was no net change in the sediment characteristics, the occurrence of Salicornia europaea L. demonstrated that pioneer saltmarsh vegetation establishment preceded the development of sediment characteristics.

TI  - Photochemical and Microbial Degradation of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Exported From Tidal Marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands export chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to estuaries, where CDOM is removed and transformed through biotic and abiotic process, subsequently impacting nutrient cycling, light availability, ecosystem metabolism, and phytoplankton activity. We examined the bioavailability and photoreactivity of CDOM exported from four Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes across three seasons and along an estuarine salinity gradient using three incubation treatments: 14-day microbial (MD), 7-day combined photochemical/microbial (PB + MD), and 7-day microbial incubation after photobleaching (MD after PB). CDOM absorption at 300 nm (a(CDOM)300) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations showed strong seasonality, with minima in winter, but CDOM quality (absorption spectral slopes, fluorescence component ratios) was less variable seasonally. PB + MD over 7 days decreased a(CDOM)300 (-56.0%), humic-like fluorescence (-67.6%), and DOC (-17.8%), but increased the spectral slope ratio S-R (=S275-295/S300-350) (+94.8%), suggesting a decrease in CDOM molecular weight. Photochemistry dominated the PB + MD treatment. Photoreactivity was greater during the winter and in marsh/watershed versus down-estuary sites, likely due to less previous light exposure. Prior photobleaching increased the bioavailability of marsh-exported CDOM, resulting in a greater loss of a(CDOM)300 and DOC, and a greater increase in humic-like fluorescence (-6.0%, -5.9%, and +18.4% change, respectively, over 7-day MD after PB incubations, vs. -2.8%, -5.5%, and +2.6% change, respectively, over 14-day MD incubations). CDOM exported from a marsh downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant showed the greatest photoreactivity and bioavailability. This highlights the significance of human activity on estuarine CDOM quality and biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - An Examination of Historical Inorganic Sedimentation and Organic Matter Accumulation in Several Marsh Types within the Mobile Bay and Mobile-Tensaw River Delta Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass accumulation rates (MAR; g cm(-2) y(-1)), linear sedimentation rates (LSR; cm y(-1)), and core geochronology derived from excess lead-210 (Pb-210) profiles and inventories measured in six sediment cores collected from marsh sites from the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta and Mobile Bay region record the importance of both continuous and event-driven inorganic sedimentation over the last 120 years. MAR in freshwater marshes varied considerably between sites and through time (0.24 and 1.31 g cm(-2) y(-1)). The highest MARs occurred in the 1950s and 1960s and correspond to record discharge events along the Mobile and Tensaw Rivers. In comparison, MAR at salt marsh sites increased almost threefold over the last 120 years (0.05 to 0.18 g cm(-2) y(-1) or 0.23 to 0.48 cm y(-1)). From 1880 to 1960, organic accumulation remained fairly constant (similar to 20%), while intermittent pulses of high inorganic sedimentation were observed following 1960. The pulses in inorganic sedimentation coincide with several major hurricanes (e.g., Hurricanes Camille, Fredric, Georges, and Ivan). The nearly threefold increase in MAR in salt marshes during the last 120 years would thus appear to be partially dependent on inorganic sedimentation from storm events. This study shows that while hurricanes, floods, and other natural hazards are well-known threats to human infrastructure and coastal ecosystems, these events also transport sediment to marshes that help abate other pressures such as sea-level rise (SLR) and subsidence.

AB  - Estimates of rates of organic matter degradation by bacterial sulfate reduction in aquifers are few, and all are obtained by indirect means.  Here we present the first direct radiotracer measurements of in situ rates of sulfate reduction for an aquifer (Romo, Denmark).  Sulfate reduction occurs in distinct reaction zones within the aquifer at rates that vary greatly over short lateral distances.  In situ rates of sulfate reduction are significantly higher than previous indirect estimates.  In contrast, rates of sulfate reduction in aquifers are orders of magnitude lower than in marine and limnic environments, emphasizing the low reactivity of natural organic matter in aquifers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF IBERIAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two areas of salt marsh in the Sado estuary - Faralhao, on the industrialized north margin and Malha da Costa, on the south bank, sheltered by a uninhabited sand spit - have been cored to study the geochemical signature of anthropogenic activity in recent (19th century onwards) intertidal sediments. Short cores were taken from each site from both the high and low marsh and were studied for texture, organic matter, pH, carbonates and geochemistry, including the heavy metals Cu, Pb and Zn. The marsh sediments are free of carbonate bioclasts and quite uniform in texture, consisting of acid to neutral clayey silt in addition to organic matter, which is higher in the top 20 cm.The vertical concentration profiles of heavy metals indicates enrichment in the top 30 cm of the sediment of the high marsh, in contrast with underlying high and low marsh sediment that has concentrations of metals at both studied sites similar to the Average Shale international reference/ continental crust sediments. The geochemical signal of anthropogenic influence in the marsh sediment was determined to have commenced from 1900-1920 using the sedimentation rates derived from Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses. Spatial contrast in contamination levels was found within the estuary, with sediments of the Faralhao marsh showing higher enrichment factors of all metals. The anthropogenic increase of the supply of metal to the Sado estuary resulted from extensive exploitation of pyrite ore in the drainage basin until the 1960's; since that time, the sediments record a break in metal input, which resulted from a decline of the mining industry. However, in the marsh located closer to the industrial area ( Faralhao) this break is followed by a local increase of heavy metal fluxes, which is interpreted as the result of intensification of anthropogenic influence. The comparison of metal concentrations in marsh sediments with target values established in quality guidelines indicates the studied area to be of environmental concern.

AB  - The response of primary producers to changes in environmental and sea-level conditions is an important topic in the study of estuarine ecosystems. Currently, sea levels are rising, and North American estuaries are in declining ecological health (USEPA, 2002 National Coastal Condition Report. USEPA, Washington, DC). This investigation examines the base of the estuarine-food web by evaluating the diets of modern and fossil Mercenaria spp. These clams are infaunal,. primary consumers that feed on suspended organic matter. Proteinaceous materials secreted within the biominerals of shell-building organisms are derived from the same diet sources as soft tissue and, therefore, are also capable of recording diet information. We have developed an empirical relationship between the isotopic composition of shell organic matter and, soft tissue, which allows food web analyses in fossils to proceed in the same manner as modern food web studies. The Delta(tissue-shell) for delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S is 0.1, 0.7, and 1.8parts per thousand. Isotopic analyses of modern Mercenaria spp. shells from coastal Virginia (delta(13)C: -12.8 to -15.9parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 11.3 to 13.7parts per thousand), and the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida (delta(13)C: -19.4 to -21.0parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 7.2-9.9parts per thousand) demonstrate, that diets are derived from phytoplankton and local salt marsh plants. Shell organic-matter delta(13)C varies from -13.1 to -27.5parts per thousand and delta(15)N varies from 2.4 to 9.8parts per thousand in Quaternary Mercenaria spp. from coastal Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. These data demonstrate that past diet sources have changed in space and time. The fact that past sea-level changes have been accompanied by shifts in local primary production is evidence that significant changes might also occur in association with presently rising sea levels.

T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 270 soil samples from 30 different habitats in 10 geographic regions of California were evaluated for the presence of rhabditid entomopathogenic nematodes. Nematodes were isolated from 26.3% of the samples. The recovered isolates were identified as Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. kraussei, S. longicaudum, S. oregonense, Heterorhabditis marelatus and H.bacteriophora. Among the steinernematids, S. kraussei and S. feltiae were the most commonly encountered species, generally occurring in acidic soils high in organic matter. Among the heterorhabditids, H. bacteriophora was isolated along the southern coast, whereas H. marelatus was recovered along the northern coast of California. Steinernematids were recovered from coniferous forests, oak woodlands and grasslands whereas heterorhabditids were isolated from coastal marshes.

TI  - The bioaccumulation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons by benthic invertebrates in an intertidal marsh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF; concentration in organism lipid/concentration in sediment on an organic carbon basis) of polyaromatic hydrocarbons varied with season and along an intertidal gradient in a coastal marsh in San Francisco Bay. The BSAFs were lowest during the local rainy season. During the dry season, BSAFs were lowest in the high intertidal zone closest to shore. Significant differences among species groups were also observed; BSAFs were lowest in polychaetes and highest in the asian clam (Potamocorbula amurensis), varying over almost three orders of magnitude (0.0069-5.4 g sediment organic C/g lipid). The BSAFs decreased with increasing percent fines in the sediments and with PAH concentrations on an organic carbon basis. We suggest that a determining variable is the content of highly aromatic soot particles, which increases during periods of surface runoff and which is expected in the dry season to be highest in the high intertidal zone where these finer particles preferentially accumulate. Correlations of BSAFs with the ratio of the logarithm of the activity coefficients in porewaters to those in sediments were generally stronger than with log K-ow indicating a limitation of octanol as a surrogate for sediment organic carbon or organism lipid. These observations qualify but also strengthen the concept of equilibrium partitioning as the determining factor in bioaccumulation by benthic organisms of nonpolar organic compounds from sediments; the assumption that ''organic carbon'' can be considered in generic terms without allowance for aromaticity and probably other factors as well, must, however, be reconsidered.

TI  - Seasonal changes in Porteresia coarctata (Tateoka) beds along a subtropical coast
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoot density, standing crop (above- and below-ground biomass) and habitat of salt marsh grass Porteresia coarctata were investigated along the coast of Bakkhali estuary, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh from January to December 2006. Shoot density of P. coarctata was influenced by season and was found to be higher (> 2 500 shoots/m(2)) in post-monsoon and minimal in monsoon season; plants were particularly active in vegetative propagation during pre-monsoon. Above-ground biomass was greater along the protected coast compared with the exposed one in this estuary. Below-ground biomass was higher (7.75-269.53 g DW/m(2)) than that above ground (2.20-114.75 g DW/m(2)). Standing crops of P. coarctata showed a negative relationship (R =-0.77; P < 0.05) with sedimentation rate, while seasonal activity influenced sedimentation. The recorded sedimentation rate was lower (6.09 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in pre-monsoon and highest (14.55 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in monsoon season. The mean value of pore water salinity was higher (34.25 +/- 5.05) during post-monsoon and lowest (18.0 +/- 3.71) in monsoon season. The soil was sandy clay in this P. coarctata bed; it consisted of 86% sand, 13% clay and 1% silt. Soil organic matter dropped during the monsoon season (0.78%-0.67%) and was highest ((2.17 +/- 1.42)%-(2.3 +/- 1.47)%) during post-monsoon, probably owing to accumulation of decomposed peat on the marsh surface. The mean pore water NH4-N concentration ranged from 2.44 +/- 1.65 to 3.33 +/- 1.82 mu g/L, with a minimum air temperature of 22.09A degrees C in post-monsoon and a maximum of 31.16A degrees C in pre-monsoon. Variations of physico-chemical parameters in the soil, water, and climate governed biological parameters of P. coarctata in the Bakkhali estuary, and were comparable with estuarine environments elsewhere.

TI  - Modulation of Spartina densiflora plant growth and metal accumulation upon selective inoculation treatments: A comparison of gram negative and gram positive rhizobacteria
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal contamination of estuaries is a severe environmental problem, for which phytoremediation is gaining momentum. In particular, the associations between halophytes-autochthonous rhizobacteria have proven useful for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes. In this work, three bacterial strains (gram-negative and gram positive) were used for Spartina densiflora inoculation. All three bacteria, particularly Pantoea strains, promoted plant growth and mitigated metal stress on polluted sediments, as revealed from functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus (PSII) and maintenance of nutrient balance. Pantoea strains did not significantly affect metal accumulation in plant roots, whereas the Bacillus strain enhanced it. Metal loading to shoots depended on particular elements, although in all cases it fell below the threshold for animal consumption. Our results confirm the possibility of modulating plant growth and metal accumulation upon selective inoculation, and the suitability of halophyte-rhizobacteria interactions as biotechnological tools for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes, preventing metal transfer to the food chain.

AB  - Estuaries profoundly transform the large amounts of carbon delivered from rivers before their transfer to the adjacent coastal zone. As a consequence of the complex biogeochemical reworking of allochthonous carbon in the sediments and the water column, CO2 and CH4 are emitted into the atmosphere. We attempt to synthesize available knowledge on biogeochemical cycling of CO2 and CH4 in estuarine environments, with a particular emphasis on the exchange with the atmosphere. Unlike CH4, the global emission of CO2 to the atmosphere from estuaries is significant compared to other components of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Bacterial carbon sources in coastal sediments: a cross-system analysis based on stable isotope data of biomarkers
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are typically highly productive, and the sediments in these systems receive organic matter from a variety of local and imported sources. To assess if general patterns are present in the origin of carbon sources for sedimentary bacteria and their relation to the origin of the sediment organic carbon pool, we compiled both literature and new data on delta C-13 of bacterial biomarkers ( the phospholipid derived fatty acids i+a15:0), along with delta C-13 data on sediment organic carbon (delta C-13(TOC)) and macrophyte biomass from a variety of typical near-coastal systems. These systems included mangroves, salt marshes (both C3 and C4-dominated sites), seagrass beds, and macroalgae-based systems, as well as unvegetated sediments. First, our delta C-13(i+a15:0) data showed large variability over the entire range of delta C-13(TOC), indicating that in many settings, bacteria may depend on carbon derived from various origins. Secondly, systems where local macrophyte production is the major supplier of organic carbon for in situ decomposition are generally limited to organic carbon-rich, peaty sites (TOC > 10 wt%), which are likely to make up only a small part of the global area of vegetated coastal systems. These carbon-rich sediments also provided a field based estimate of isotopic fractionation between bacterial carbon sources and biomarkers (-3.7 +/- 2.1%), which is similar to the expected value of about -3% associated with the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Thirdly, only in systems with low TOC ( below similar to 1 wt%), we consistently found that bacteria were selectively utilizing an isotopically enriched carbon source, which may be root exudates but more likely is derived from microphytobenthos. In other systems with between similar to 1 and 10 wt% TOC, bacteria appear to show on average little selectivity and delta C-13(i+a15:0) data generally follow the delta C-13(TOC), even in systems where the TOC is a mixture of algal and macrophyte sources that generally are believed to have a very different degradability.

TI  - Environmental factors shaping microbial community structure in salt marsh sediments
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined benthic microbial communities in 3 contrasting subtidal salt marsh sediments over the course of a year to investigate the relationship between environmental conditions and benthic microbial community structure. Samples were collected monthly from a high-energy sandy beach, a tidal creek bed, and a Spartina alterniflora marsh border. The concentrations and biomasses of benthic microalgae (BMA), total and potentially active bacteria (measured by an enzyme-activated fluorogenic compound), heterotrophic protists, and metazoan meiofauna were measured at each location. Sediment grain size and porewater pH explained most of the variability in biomass distributions; variations in benthic biomass did not correlate well with temperature. There was a seasonal shift from a BMA-dominated community in the spring and summer months to bacteria-dominated communities in autumn at all locations, when inactive bacteria were most abundant. When normalized to sediment porewater volume, benthic protists concentrations were not significantly related to sediment porosity, Benthic protist porewater concentrations (mean: 3.4 x 10(3), range: 0.1 to 9.3 x 10(3) protists ml(-1)) were comparable to protist concentrations in the water column. In contrast, bacteria were several orders of magnitude more concentrated in the sediments (mean: 4.2 x 10(9); range: 0.6 to 16 x 10(9) bacteria ml-1) than the water column. Low abundances of protists relative to bacteria appear to contribute to long bacterial turnover times, especially in fine-grained sediments. We hypothesize that both grazing by meiofauna and low anaerobic growth efficiency lead to relatively low biomass of bacterivorous protists.

TI  - Quantification of macrobenthic effects on diagenesis using a multicomponent inverse model in salt marsh sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a multicomponent inverse model, we quantified the rates of organic matter (OM) remineralization and the relative importance of major terminal electron acceptors [Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides and SO42-] in salt marsh sediments with varying degrees of bioturbation and vegetation at Skidaway Island, Georgia. The model determined the rates of OM diagenesis by seeking simultaneous agreement between measured and model-calculated depth-concentration profiles of multiple major redox species while using the biological transport parameters determined from direct field observations. The OM degradation rates are found to be greater and penetrate deeper in sediments with vegetation or bioturbation than in sediments with limited macrobenthic components, in which organic matter degradation is restricted to the immediate vicinity of water-sediment interface. The results also confirmed previous observations that Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides are much more important than sulfate as terminal electron acceptors in the heavily bioturbated station and provided the numerical values to the depth-dependent relative importance. Solid-phase Fe is recycled as a terminal electron acceptor greater than or equal to30 times in the bioturbated station, because biological mixing repeatedly moves reduced Fe(II) back into the aerobic environment, where it is reoxidized to form Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides and is reused as a terminal electron acceptor. Vegetation appears to have little influence on net solute transport, but it stimulates microbial activities and significantly enhances the remineralization of OM at depths.

TI  - Patterns and Controls of Nutrient Concentrations in a Southeastern United States Tidal Creek
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial inputs largely govern nutrient delivery to the coastal ocean, and subsequent processes transform these nutrients in the land-ocean transition zone. Here, we describe spatial and temporal patterns in surface water chemistry from the Duplin, a salt marsh/tidal creek system located in coastal Georgia, USA. Key drivers of nutrient concentration patterns in the Duplin include discharge from the nearby Altamaha River, groundwater inputs, exchange with the marsh platform, and biological processes within the tidal creek. Altamaha River discharge is correlated with salinity in the Duplin, but the processes taking place within the Duplin watershed regulate the distribution of other dissolved and particulate materials. Long-term data sets advance our understanding of the relative importance of these processes in generating the observed patterns in surface water chemistry. This knowledge improves our ability to predict how coastal systems will respond to anthropogenic perturbations.

T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Nineteen sediment cores were collected from five salt marshes on the northern shore of Cape Cod where previously restricted tidal exchange was restored to part of the marshes. Cores were collected in duplicate from two locations within each marsh complex: one upstream and one downstream from the former tidal restriction (typically caused by an undersized culvert or a berm). The unaltered, natural downstream sites provide a comparison against the historically restricted upstream sites. The sampled cores represent a chronosequence of restoration occurring between 2001-10. Collected cores were up to 168 cm in length with dry bulk density ranging from 0.04 to 2.62 grams per cubic centimeter and carbon content 0.12 % to 48.91 %. Land surface elevation was measured at each site (ranging from 0.484 meters to 1.51 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the boundaries of each site within current tidal conditions. Gamma counting results for excess lead-210 were used to construct Constant Rate of Supply age models to date individual depth intervals in the core. Additionally, gamma counting results for other radionuclides, particularly cesium-137, gave further insight to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. Carbon isotopes were measured to evaluate organic matter source.

TI  - Nutrient Effects on Belowground Organic Matter in a Minerogenic Salt Marsh, North Inlet, SC
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter, roots, rhizomes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates were examined in minerogenic marshes of the North Inlet Estuary, a system dominated by sediment depositional processes and typical of the Southeast USA. Three marsh sites were sampled: a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment at Goat Island; the high marsh, low marsh, and creekbank of Crab Haul Creek, a fringing marsh that only receives drainage from a forested watershed; and three creekbank locations in Debidue Creek, which receives drainage from a residential and golf course development situated at its headwaters. Goat Island responses to 12 years of nutrient fertilization were an increase in soil organic matter (OM), an increase in number of rhizomes, enlarged rhizome diameters, and increased CO2 emission rates. At soil depths of 10-20 cm, all Debidue creekbank locations had significantly more rhizomes than the reference Crab Haul creekbank. The rhizome diameters at the mid and upper Debidue creekbank locations were significantly larger than the Debidue mouth and reference Crab Haul creekbank. The upper Debidue and the Crab Haul creekbanks had similar soil percent OM, which was significantly greater than the mid Debidue, which was greater than the Debidue mouth. CO2 emission rates at the fertilized Goat Island plots were similar in magnitude to the upper Debidue and significantly greater than the Goat Island control plots and the reference Crab Haul Creek. Inputs of sediment in marshes dominated by depositional processes may buffer the system from adverse effects of nutrient exposure, while increases in soil OM and rhizomes in response to nutrients may contribute to peat formation.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ATTRACTANTS IN TRAPS FOR GREENHEAD FLY (DIPTERA, TABANIDAE) COLLECTIONS ON A CAPE-COD, MASSACHUSETTS, SALT-MARSH
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Field studies evaluated 1-octen-3-ol (octenol), carbon dioxide (dry ice), and a combination of both attractants in comparison with unbaited traps for collecting greenhead flies on a Massachusetts salt marsh. The carbon dioxide (CO2)-baited trap collections, and the CO2 with octenol-baited trap collections were more than 300% greater than the unbaited collections. The octenol-baited traps collected 83% more greenhead flies than unbaited traps. Afternoon trap collections were 2.5 times greater than morning collections. Dissections and measurements of a sample of the flies collected indicated that the ''cryptic species'' composition of greenhead flies was 77% Tabanus nigrovittatus and 23% Tabanus conterminus. Ovarian tracheole examinations of a sample of the flies showed that 99% of the greenhead flies had laid eggs before being trapped. The use of CO2 as an attractant in the traps could be cost effective in small problem areas, and the use of octenol in the box traps should be evaluated in large areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION

CP  - 71st Meeting of the American-Mosquito-Control-Association
CL  - Vancouver, CANADA
AB  - An overview is presented of the recent advancements in research activities conducted to evaluate mosquito traps, insecticide-impregnated targets baited with combinations of attractants, and strategies for using mass trapping techniques for adult mosquito population management. Technologies that use semiochemicals (attractants), traps and targets, and mass trapping are relatively new for management of adult mosquito populations. To date, emphasis has been placed primarily on developing barriers of attractant-baited and insecticide-impregnated targets. The most successful continuous use of this type of technology has been at Stevens' Landing, Collier County, Florida. Recently, commercially available traps have been evaluated for their ability to reduce nuisance populations of mosquitoes. Whereas use of Mosquito Magnet (TM) Pro (MM-Pro) traps along a nature trail on an isolated island (Atsena Otie) in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a significant reduction in annoyance caused by the black salt-marsh mosquito, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (Wied.), a perimeter of the same traps did not result in the same level of mosquito reduction in a residential area in Gainesville, FL.

TI  - Native plant restoration combats environmental change: development of carbon and nitrogen sequestration capacity using small cordgrass in European salt marshes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of salt marshes is critical in the context of climate change and eutrophication of coastal waters because their vegetation and sediments may act as carbon and nitrogen sinks. Our primary objectives were to quantify carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and sequestration rates in restored marshes dominated by Spartina maritima to provide support for restoration and management strategies that may offset negative aspects of eutrophication and climate change in estuarine ecosystems. Sediment C content was between ca. 13 mg C g(-1)and sediment N content was ca. 1.8 mg N g(-1). The highest C content for S. maritima was recorded in leaves and stems (ca. 420 mg C g(-1)) and the lowest in roots (361 +/- 4 mg C g(-1)). S. maritima also concentrated more N in its leaves (31 +/- 1 mg N g(-1)) than in other organs. C stock in the restored marshes was 29.6 t C ha(-1); ca. 16 % was stored in S. maritima tissues. N stock was 3.6 t N ha(-1), with 8.3 % stored in S. maritima. Our results showed that the S. maritima restored marshes, 2.5 years after planting, were sequestering atmospheric C and, therefore, provide some mitigation for global warming. Stands are also capturing nitrogen and reducing eutrophication. The concentrations of C and N contents in sediments, and cordgrass relative cover of 62 %, and low below-ground biomass (BGB) suggest restored marshes can sequester more C and N. S. maritima plantations in low marshes replace bare sediments and invasive populations of exotic Spartina densiflora and increase the C and N sequestration capacity of the marsh by increasing biomass production and accumulation.

TI  - Potential Effects of Episodic Deposition on Nutrients and Heavy Metals in Decomposing Litters ofSuaeda glaucain Salt Marsh of the Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Episodic deposition has been recognized as a major factor affecting the decomposition rate of detrital material in salt marshes. In this paper, three one-off burial treatments, no burial treatment (0 cm, NBT), current burial treatment (10 cm, CBT) and strong burial treatment (20 cm, SBT), were designed in intertidal zone of the Yellow River Estuary to determine the potential influences of episodic deposition on nutrient (C, N) and heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn, Cd, V and Co) variations in decomposing litters ofSuaeda glauca. Results showed that although various burial treatments showed no statistical difference in decomposition rate ofS. glauca, the values generally followed the sequence of CBT (0.002 403/d) > SBT (0.002 195/d) > NBT (0.002 060/d). The nutrients and heavy metals in decomposing litters of the three burial treatments exhibited different variations except for N, Cu, Cr, Ni and Co. Except for Mn, no significant differences in C, N, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, V and Co concentrations occurred among the three treatments (P> 0.05). With increasing burial depth, Cr and Cd levels generally increased while Cu, Ni and Mn concentrations decreased. Although episodic deposition was generally favorable for C and N release fromS. glauca, its influence on release was insignificant. In the three burial treatments, Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co stocks inS. glaucagenerally evidenced the export of metals from litter to environment, and, with increasing burial depth, the export amounts increased greatly. TheS. glaucawere particular efficient in binding Cd and releasing Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co, and, with increasing burial depth, stocks of Cu in decomposing litters generally shifted from release to accumulation. The experiment indicated that the potential eco-toxic risk of Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co exposure would be serious as the strong burial episodes occurred inS. glaucamarsh.

TI  - The role of soluble Fe(III) in the cycling of iron and sulfur in coastal marine sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In marine sediments, Fe(III) is found predominantly as a solid. Recently, however, soluble species of Fell complexed by natural organic ligands have been detected in coastal marine sediments with voltammetric microelectrodes. The role of soluble Fe3+ complexes in diagenesis is unknown. In anoxic conditions, soluble Fell can effectively oxidize FeS2 and recycle iron and sulfur for use as terminal electron acceptors during natural organic matter (NOM) degradation. Alternatively, soluble Fe3+ complexes can catalyze the formation of FeS and FeS2 through the rapid chemical reduction of Fell by dissolved sulfide. To better understand the role of soluble Fell in the transformation of iron and sulfur in marine sediments, we incubated the first few centimeters of unvegetated salt marsh sediment in plug-flow reactors. Microbial iron reduction seemed to prevail in suboxic conditions, but sulfate reduction outcompeted microbial iron reduction in the presence of reactive organic metabolites. The dominance of sulfate reduction led to the complete removal of reactive iron oxides by precipitation of FeS. Experiments mimicking the enrichment of soluble Fell Complexes in reduced sediments show that soluble Fe3+ does not reoxidize FeS and pyrite; rather, it promotes pyrite precipitation by enhancing sulfate reduction via complex bacterial interactions. The rate of pyrite formation in the presence of soluble Fell is much higher than previously reported in the literature, suggesting that soluble Fell might promote alternative pathways for microbial degradation of NOM that ultimately results in the immobilization of Fe and S as reduced iron sulfide minerals.

TI  - Fortnightly Tidal Modulations Affect Net Community Production in a Mesotidal Estuary
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical in situ chemical sensors enable sampling intervals and durations that rival acoustic techniques used for measuring currents. Coupling these high-frequency bio-geochemical and physical measurements in estuaries to address ecosystem-scale questions, however, is still comparatively novel. This study investigated how tides affect ecosystem metabolism in a mesotidal estuary in central California (Elkhorn Slough). Dissolved oxygen measurements were used to estimate the terms in a control volume budget for a tidal creek/marsh complex at tidal timescales over several weeks. Respiration rates were 1.6 to 7.3 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1); net community production approached 20 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1). We found that aquatic NCP integrated throughout the creek complex varied significantly over the spring-neap cycle. The intertidal contribution to aquatic metabolism was net heterotrophic during spring tides and generally in balance during neap tides because spring-tide marsh inundation was limited to nighttime, and therefore the marsh could not contribute any primary production to the water column. At the estuary scale, the fortnightly export of oxygen from the main channel to the intertidal was largely balanced by an advective flux up-estuary.

T2  - Southern African Journal of Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The flux of dissolved inorganic nutrients (NH-4-N, NO-2-N, NO-3-N, SRP) and suspended particulates (particulate organic carbon POC, and particulate inorganic carbon PIC) was measured across the mouth of a small creek draining a portion of the intertidal Spartina salt marsh in the Swartkops estuary. Direct measurements of constituents concentration, the volume of water flowing into and out of the creek basin at discrete time intervals, and tidal height were made over full spring tide cycles on a two-weekly basis during a 12 month study period. Results show that the marsh acts as a sink for NH-4-N, NO-2-N, and NO-3-N on an annual basis, but exports soluble reactive phosphate to the contiguous estuarine waters. The marsh also imports nominal amounts of suspended POC and PIC ( lt 1.5 mm in size), but apparently exports larger detrital particles ( gt 1.5 mm) on ebb tides to the estuary. It is concluded that the marsh retains and utilizes most of its own production and functions virtually as an independent ecosystem.

TI  - Mechanisms of Organic Matter Export in Estuaries with Contrasting Carbon Sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modifications in land use and climate will result in shifts in the magnitude and composition of organic matter (OM) transported from wetlands to coastal waters, but differentiation between riverine and wetland OM sources in coastal areas remains a challenge. Here, we evaluate particulate and dissolved OM export dynamics in two representative estuary geomorphologies-Apalachicola Bay (AP) and Barataria Bay (BB), characterized primarily by blackwater river inputs and high particle abundance, respectively. The magnitude and composition of OM exported from each estuary was evaluated based on seasonal measurements of surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen, the stable isotopic composition of DOC and POC, dissolved and particulate lignin phenols, and carbon-normalized dissolved lignin-phenol yields. Data and discriminant analyses support the initial hypothesis; AP is dominated by a more terrestrial source of OM due to importance of fluvial dissolved OM inputs, while BB is a more particle-rich and wetland carbon-dominated system. Total lignin export (sum of mean dissolved and mean particulate) was higher in BB (5.73 +/- 2.50 x 10(5) kg/year) than in AP (4.21 +/- 2.35 x 10(5) kg/year). Particulate lignin export from BB was greater than the export of dissolved lignin at either BB or AP, suggesting coastal marsh erosion may be driving this comparatively large export of particulate lignin. These data have important implications for the stability of stored OM in coastal habitats, particularly since such habitats in this region are highly vulnerable due to relative sea level rise.

TI  - Co-occurrence of habitat-modifying invertebrates: effects on structural and functional properties of a created salt marsh
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The roles of co-occurring herbivores that modify habitat structure and ecosystem processes have seldom been examined in manipulative experiments or explored in early successional communities. In a created marsh in southern California (USA), we tested the individual and combined effects of two epibenthic invertebrates on nutrient and biomass pools, community structure, and physical habitat features. We manipulated snail (Cerithidea californica) and crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) presence in field enclosures planted with pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at elevations matching the plant's lower extent in an adjacent natural marsh. In the 4-month experiment, C. californica altered habitat structure by reducing sediment surface heterogeneity and shear strength (a measure of sediment stability) markedly throughout the enclosures. Both invertebrates had strong negative effects on a group of correlated sediment physicochemical characteristics, including nitrogen and organic matter concentrations and soil moisture. In addition, both invertebrates greatly reduced benthic chlorophyll a, a proxy for biomass of microphytobenthos. Compared to controls, macroalgal cover was up to sixfold lower with crabs present, while snails increased cover at low elevations of enclosures. Unexpectedly, macroalgal cover was eliminated with both species present, perhaps through P. crassipes consumption of larger thalli and C. californica reduction in cover of recruits. Neither species influenced the S. virginica canopy (quantified with an index of branch length and number); however, at the lower elevation of enclosures, the two species together negatively impacted the plant canopy. The two invertebrates' modifications to our experimental marshes led to distinct suites of biotic and physicochemical features depending on their presence or co-occurrence, with the latter producing several unexpected results. We propose that the roles and interactions of habitat-modifying fauna deserve further attention, particularly in the context of efforts to conserve and restore the processes found in natural systems.

TI  - Influence of flooding and vegetation on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics in the pore water of a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Four sites were selected in a salt marsh in the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina): (I) low marsh (flooded by the tide twice daily) vegetated by S. alterniflora; (2) non-vegetated low marsh; (3) high marsh (flooded only in spring tides) vegetated by S. alterniflora; (4) non-vegetated high marsh. The pH and Eh were measured in sediments, while dissolved nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate) and particulate organic matter (POM) were determined in pore water. pH (6.2-8.7) was only affected by vegetation in low areas. Eh (from 300 to 250 mV) was lower at low sites than at high ones; in the latter, the values were higher in the non-vegetated sediments. The POM concentration was greater in the high marsh than in the low marsh, with no effect of vegetation. Ammonium was the most abundant nitrogen nutrient species in pore water, except in the non-vegetated high marsh where nitrate concentration was higher. All nitrogen nutrients were affected by both flooding and vegetation. Phosphate was always present in pore water at all sites throughout the year and its concentration varied within narrow limits, with no effect of flooding and greater values always at non-vegetated sites. Our results showed that the variability of the pore water composition within the marsh is greater than the temporal variation, meaning that both tidal flooding and vegetation are important in the dynamics of nutrients and organic matter in the sediment pore water.

This species showed better growth at salt level up to 300 mM, whereas extreme salt stress (400 mM NaCl) resulted in a decrease in growth and other physio-anatomical parameters relating photosynthetic activity. Anatomical characters such as leaf and epidermal thickness, proportion of mesophyll tissue, large cortical cells, efficient conducting tissue (phloem and metaxylem area) and stomatal size as well as density contributed towards salinity tolerance and normal photosynthetic activity in C. erectus.

TI  - Unraveling the Gordian Knot: Eight testable hypotheses on the effects of nutrient enrichment on tidal wetland sustainability
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The position of tidal wetlands at the land-sea interface makes them especially vulnerable to the effects of nutrient discharges and sea level rise (SLR). Experimental studies of coastal wetland nutrient additions report conflicting results among and within habitats, highlighting the importance of site-specific factors, and how spatial and temporal scaling modulates responses. This suite of influences as SIR accelerates creates a "Gordian Knot" that may compromise coastal habitat integrity. We present eight testable hypotheses here to loosen this knot by identifying critical modulators about nutrient form, soil type and porosity, physiochemical gradients, and eco-evolutionary responses that may control the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland sustainability: (1) the delivery and form of the nutrient shapes the ecosystem response; (2) soil type mediates the effects of nutrient enrichment on marshes; (3) belowground responses cannot be solely explained by phenotypic responses: (4) shifting zones of redox and salinity gradients modulate nutrient enrichment impacts; (5) eco-evolutionary processes can drive responses to nutrient availability; (6) nutrient enrichment leads to multiple changed ecosystem states; (7) biogeography trumps a plant's plastic responses to nutrient enrichment; and, (8) nutrient-enhanced wetlands are more susceptible to additional (and anticipated) anthropogenic changes. They provide a framework to investigate and integrate the urgently needed research to understand how excess nutrients threaten the sustainability of coastal wetlands, and wetlands in general. While there is no single 'right way' to test these hypotheses, including a combination of complex and simple, highly-replicated experiments is essential. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Rates and controls of anaerobic microbial respiration across spatial and temporal gradients in saltmarsh sediments
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the rates and controls of anaerobic respiration reactions coupled to organic matter mineralization as a function of space and time along a transect from a bioturbated creekbank to the midmarsh in Georgia saltmarsh sediments. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 3 sites during 5 sampling periods throughout the growth season. The sites differed according to hydrologic regime and the abundance of dominant plants and macrofauna. SRR and pore water / solid phase geochemistry showed evidence of enhanced sediment oxidation at sites exposed to intense bioturbation. Iron(III) reduction rates (FeRR) were directly determined in saltmarsh sediments for the first time, and in agreement with measured SRR, higher rates were observed at the bioturbated, unvegetated creekbank (BUC) and bioturbated, vegetated levee (BVL) sites in comparison to a vegetated mid-marsh (MM) site. An unexpected result was the fact that SRR varied nearly as much between sites (2-3 x) as it did with temperature or season (3-4 x). The BVL site, vegetated by the tall form of Spartina alterniflora, always exhibited the highest SRR and carbon oxidation rates (> 4000 nmol cm(-)3 d(-)1) with high activity levels extending deep (greater than or equal to 50 cm) into the sediment, while the MM site, dominated by the short form of Spartina, always exhibited the lowest SRR which were localized to the top 15 cm of sediment. SRR and FeRR at BUC were intermediate between those measured at the BVL and MM. Acetate was the most abundant microbial fermentation product (concentrations up to > 1 mM) in marsh porewaters, and its distribution reflected respiration activity. Chemical exchange, caused by bioturbation, appeared to be the primary control explaining trends in rates of sulfate and Fe(III) reduction with macrophytes and carbon source acting as secondary controls.

TI  - Metal binding in estuarine humic and fulvic acids: FTIR analysis of humic acid-metal complexes.
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humic and fulvic acids isolated from salt marsh estuaries of the southeastern United States had copper binding capacities (CuBC) of 0.16 to 0.26 mu g atm Cu2+ mg(-1) humic acid and 0.17 to 0.24 mu g atm Cu2+ mg(-1) fulvic acid. Competitive reactions of humic substances with alkaline earth elements Ca2+' and Mg2+' reduced the CuBC by only 11% for fulvic acids and by 17% for humic acids. Competition with the trivalent metal ions Al3+ and Fe3+ reduced the CuBC in humic substances by 30-40%. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analyses of the humic-metal complexes suggest that Cu(ll) may be bound preferentially by oxygen-containing functional groups in estuarine fulvic acids, but there is a much higher involvement of nitrogen-containing functional groups in binding Cu(II) to estuarine humic acids. FTIR spectra were also collected for humic acid-metal complexes of Ag, Au, Hg, Mn and Pb.

TI  - Macromolecular dynamics of the photosynthetic system over a seasonal developmental progression in Spartina alterniflora
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora Loisel. is a dominant primary producer in salt marsh intertidal zones along the Bay of Fundy of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, where it has a 5-month growing season from May to September. We quantified key subunits of the S.aalterniflora photosynthetic system (chlorophyll, PsbA, PsaC, AtpB, RbcL) over a seasonal developmental progression to determine resource allocations and estimate capacities for key subprocesses of photosynthesis catalyzed by light-harvesting antennae, photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII, respectively), ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthase, and RuBisCO (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase). Early in the season, all of the macromolecules peaked in concentration around day 159, but then declined as leaves elongated. Later in the season, just after flowering, chlorophyll b, PsbA, PsaC, and AtpB peaked again before declining at the end of the season. RbcL, however, did not exhibit a second late-season peak, but continually declined from the early-season peak. Estimates of metabolic flux per PSII and per RuBisCO were closely parallel until late in the season, indicating coordinated regulation of catalytic turnover per complex. Early in the season, carbon fixation per RuBisCO peaked near the expected turnover rate (k(cat)) for a C4 plant, but then declined. The effective absorbance cross sections of PSII varied seasonally, reflecting significant regulation of antenna performance across the season.

TI  - Contribution of soil properties to the assessment of a seawater irrigation programme as a management strategy for abandoned solar saltworks
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selective recovery of microalgae from diverse habitats using "phyto-specific" 16S rDNA primers
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental PCR is a common tool for surveying aquatic microalgae; however, universal primers generally employed are not specific to phytoplankton and typically recover nonphotosynthetic bacteria at high frequencies. Using a 16S rDNA "phyto-specific" primer, we were able to selectively amplify sequences of photosynthetic species from several mixed aquatic samples, even when large numbers of nonphotosynthetic microorganisms were present. We identified 21 microalgal sequences from three different habitats: salt marshes in Virginia, river basins in North Carolina, and sea ice in Alaska. In contrast, universal 16S primers recovered a majority of nonphotosynthetic organisms from some of the same samples. Our results indicate that phytoplankton-specific primers are efficient in selectively amplifying a broad diversity of microalgae in mixed environmental samples and, therefore, can reduce the noise from extraneous species that often dominates molecular surveys of aquatic samples.

TI  - Soil Characteristics of Sediment-Amended Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) Swamps of Coastal Louisiana
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amendments of sediment from dredging activities have played an important role in raising the elevation of sinking coastal wetlands. This study compared the soil characteristics of sediment-amended coastal swamps in the Barataria Preserve unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve with natural swamps along Bayou des Familles. The sandy sediment amendments used in the coastal forests had different soil texture and characteristics than the more organic soils of the natural swamps. Three years after the application of these sediments on the sediment-amended swamps, dewatering and compaction of the sediment had occurred but the sediment still had high salinity and bulk density, and low organic matter content. The two sediment-amended swamps differed from each other in that Site 1 had a higher elevation (mean=25 cm higher) and drier soil than Site 2. The effects of sediment in coastal forested wetlands require separate consideration from studies of salt marshes, e. g., the weight of the sediment might damage tree roots, or the amendments might influence soil stability during storms in a different way. Generally, this study suggests that shallower depths of sediment are more likely to yield environments beneficial to these sinking baldcypress swamps in coastal Louisiana.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasions impact CH4 and N2O fluxes from a salt marsh in eastern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species originating from North America, has spread widely along the eastern coast of China. However, the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on CH4 and N2O fluxes from salt marshes in eastern China are not fully understood. We conducted a field experiment in three treatments (transparent, opaque, and clipping) to compare the CH4 and N2O fluxes from S. alterniflora community with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities and the mudflat in a coastal wetland of eastern China over one year. CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora community was higher than the S. salsa community and mudflat but lower than the P. australis community. The opaque treatment did not significantly alter CH4 flux, except for the S. salsa community. Clipping significantly decreased CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but increased CH4 flux from the S. salsa community. In contrast, N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities were lower than for the S. salsa community and mudflat. The opaque treatment did not significantly change N2O fluxes across communities. Clipping significantly increased mean N2O fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but did not significantly change N2O flux in the S. salsa community. CH4 flux was positively related to the aboveground biomass and negatively related to density, whereas N2O flux was negatively related to aboveground biomass and positively related to density. Meanwhile, CH4 flux was strongly dependent on temperature, soil moisture and water depth (P < 0.05), while N2O fluxes under the transparent and opaque chambers were significantly related to water depth (P < 0.05), but N2O flux under the clipping treatment was not significantly related to environmental factors (P > 0.05). Overall, CH4 and N2O fluxes from this coastal wetland were 17.38g m (2) and -36.64 mg m (2), respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasions in this salt marsh in eastern China could play a negligible role in emitting CH4 and a significant role in absorbing N2O when compared with other studies worldwide.

TI  - High-frequency greenhouse gas flux measurement system detects winter storm surge effects on salt marsh
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical controlling factors on coastal plant communities are among the most dynamic of known ecosystems, but climate change alters coastal surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes, which makes rapid measurement of greenhouse gas fluxes critical. Greenhouse gas exchange rates in these terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems are highly variable worldwide with climate, soil type, plant community, and weather. Therefore, increasing data collection and availability should be a priority. Here, we demonstrate and validate physical and analytical modifications to automated soil-flux chamber measurement methods for unattended use in tidally driven wetlands, allowing the high-frequency capture of storm surge and day/night dynamics. Winter CO2 flux from Sarcocornia perennis marsh to the atmosphere was significantly greater during the day (2.8 mmol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the night (2.2 mmol m(-2) hr(-1); p < 0.001), while CH4 was significantly greater during the night (0.16 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the day (-0.13 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1); p = 0.04). The magnitude of CO2 flux during the day and the frequency of CH4 flux were reduced during a surge (p < 0.001). Surge did not significantly affect N2O flux, which without non-detects was normally distributed around -24.2 nmol m(-2) hr(-1). Analysis with sustained-flux global potentials and increased storm surge frequency scenarios, 2020 to 2100, suggested that the marsh in winter remains an atmospheric CO2 source. The modeled results showed an increased flux of CO2 to the atmosphere, while in soil, the uptake of CH4 increased and N2O uptake decreased. We present analytical routines to correctly capture gas flux curves in dynamic overland flooding conditions and to flag data that are below detection limits or from unobserved chamber-malfunction situations. Storm surge is an important phenomenon globally, but event-driven, episodic factors can be poorly estimated by infrequent sampling. Wider deployment of this system would permit inclusion of surge events in greenhouse gas estimates.

TI  - Survival, growth and reproduction of the salt-marsh amphipod Uhlorchestia spartinophila reared on natural diets of senescent and dead Spartina alterniflora leaves
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The talitrid amphipod Uhlorchestia spartinophila lives in close association with standing-dead leaves of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of North America. This study probed the strength of the trophic link between the amphipod population and the decomposition process in this detrital-based ecosystem. We measured survival, growth and reproductive output in groups of amphipods reared for 6 wk on five diets derived from sheath and blade portions of S. alterniflora leaves just prior to (senescent) and during (dead) decomposition. In unfed treatments, the daily specific mortality rate was 0.391 and starved amphipods survived no longer than lid. Among the fed treatments, a diet of senescent sheaths resulted in the lowest survival (20%) and yielded no offspring. Groups fed senescent blades, dead sheaths, dead blades and unwashed dead sheaths had survival rates of 56 to 84% and produced 5.0 to 12.5 offspring replicate(-1). Sex ratio usually favored females, but approached unity in treatments with high overall survival, suggesting that quality of available food resources may influence sex ratio in this species. Mean specific growth rates (mm mm(-1) d(-1)) ranged from 0.013 to 0.016, and matched previous estimates of growth from field populations. Overall ecological performance (survival + growth + reproduction) was similar for all food treatments, except senescent sheaths, which yielded a final mean (+/- SD) dry biomass (0.4 +/- 0.42 mg replicate(-1)) of amphipods significantly lower than that of other diets (1.7 +/- 0.81 to 2.6 +/- 0.69 mg replicate(-1)). Natural diets derived from decomposing cordgrass leaves can fulfill the nutritional requirements of U. spartinophila populations, but variation in initial amounts of living fungal biomass among the five experimental diets only partially explained the responses of amphipods in our experiment. Structural characteristics and variation in rates of fungal occupation within different portions of cordgrass leaves may affect the amphipod's ability to access plant production made available by decomposers.

TI  - Genesis of soils from Holocene tidal deposits at the North Sea coast
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern North Sea coast has served as an exemplification to analyse and discuss the genesis of soils from Holocene tidal deposits. The accumulation wedge of Holocene tidal deposits at the North Sea coast is artificially embanked for the most part. In the enclosed area (hinterland) a variety of different soils developed. Disparate models attempting to explain the genesis of these soils deduce genesis of hinterland soils from recent foreland conditions, disregarding that geogenic preconditions have fundamentally changed. By consolidating and reviewing established literature we show that differences in geogenic preconditions are the initiating key for a feasible model. Describing geogenic preconditions to infer pedogenic processes, we develop a model comprising four different development pathways. High settling velocities and regular flooding, as present in the foreland, cause high inputs of mineral sediments and carbonate, moderate sulfur dynamics and thus the development of calcareous soils. Synsedimentary decalcification prevails in irregularly flooded areas due to enduring low sedimentation rates, low carbonate inputs and moderate sulfur dynamics under alternating redox states, as mainly proposed for the unobstructed landscape. High contents of soil organic matter (SOM) facilitate intensive sulfur dynamics creating potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), which become extreme acid upon oxidation (actual acid sulfate soils (AASS)). A great gradient in depositional conditions, occurring at unobstructed plain coasts, enables the deposition of deflocculated fine-grained sediments which promotes the formation of very compact soils with low water conductivities. Although this proposed model is based mainly on conditions known from the German North Sea coast, it is shown that shaping geogenic and pedogenic processes are applicable to other humid coastal regions around the world.

TI  - THE CORRUBEDO BEACH LAGOON COMPLEX, GALICIA, SPAIN - DYNAMICS, SEDIMENTS AND RECENT EVOLUTION OF A MESOTIDAL COASTAL EMBAYMENT
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Corrubedo beach-lagoon complex is situated in an embayment on the northwestern coast of Spain.  The 4.1 m tidal range and southwesterly winds are the main agents of sediment transportation.  The sediments are hybrid arenites (siliciclastic + bioclastic), with carbonate percentages ranging from 27.36 to 54.10%; silt, clay and organic matter occur in minor amounts.  Repeated mapping and sampling of the beach, tidal channels, salt marshes and active and vegetated dunes recorded the vertical facies associations and their temporal evolution.  Two peat layers at 0.6 and 1.7 m below the present-day marsh have yielded ages of 2280 +/- 60 yrs B.P. and 1045 +/- 125 yrs B.P. respectively.  The possible causes of the relative sea-level rise are discussed.

TI  - Geo-pedogenesis of Salic Fluvisols on the North Sea island of Spiekeroog
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the mainland's Salic Fluvisols of the southern North Sea coast are rich in carbonate, those of the adjacent island Spiekeroog are not. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the Salic Fluvisols of Spiekeroog in comparison to those of the mainland and to find out the reasons for the lack of carbonate, which was supposed to be an interaction between sedimentation and sulfur dynamics. The vegetation, many physical and chemical properties (e.g. pH, C-org, salinity, Fe-od, exchangeable cations, CEC) of the Spiekeroog Fluvisols are similar to those of the mainland. However, the Spiekeroog soil profiles extended over the marsh sediments, and the sand sediments below and they contained more silt and less clay and carbonate (0.3 - 34.5 g kg(-1)) than the soils of the mainland. A survey proved carbonate-free areas. The relatively moderate S dynamics showed a spatial and temporal stabile SO4-S-fraction (0.3 - 0.6 mg g(-1)), a fairly stabile HNO3-HCl-S fraction (1.5 - 2.9 mg g(-1)), but a variable HCI-S fraction. The vertical Cs-137 distribution showed peaks at 3 - 4 and 7 - 8 cm soil depth, indicating sedimentation rates of 0.2 - 0.5 cm a(-1). The results showed that moderate S dynamics lead to carbonate losses which are not compensated because of low sedimentation rates. Consequently, the Spiekeroog Salic Fluvisols will enter the terrestrial phase of soil development without carbonate. Thus, besides the usual pedogenesis of Eutric Fluvisols via Salic and Calcaric Fluvisols, the investigation proved a direct development from Salic to Eutric Fluvisols.

TI  - Mass spawning of crabs: ecological implications in subtropical Australia
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We review links between autotrophic production, crab herbivory and estuarine food chains in southeastern Australia, a region where mangrove and saltmarsh co-exist towards mangrove poleward limits. Studies in estuaries and embayments across the region have demonstrated a consistent and important role of crab larvae released in synchronised spawning during the spring tide in supplementing the diet of zooplanktivorous fishes. These numerically dominant fishes have been linked through isotopic studies to commercially important predator species. The role of macrophytic vegetation (mangrove and saltmarsh) in the diet of crabs remains controversial, though isotopic analysis has demonstrated the contribution of the C4 grass Sporobolus virginicus to crabs feeding in saltmarsh. Other dietary sources include microphytic algae, and potentially stranded zooplankton. The link between sediment organic matter, crab and zooplanktivore isotopic composition remained tightly coupled in spite of variation in anthropogenic N between estuaries and the isotopic signature of mangroves. Long-term threats to these trophic linkages include coastal squeeze associated with sea-level rise, and the fragmentation and disconnection of habitats.

TI  - Indicative value of benthic foraminifera for biomonitoring: Assignment to ecological groups of sensitivity to total organic carbon of species from European intertidal areas and transitional waters
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This work contributes to the ongoing work aiming at confirming benthic foraminifera as a biological quality element. In this study, benthic foraminifera from intertidal and transitional waters from the English Channel/European Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean Sea were assigned to five ecological groups using the weighted-averaging optimum with respect to TOC of each species. It was however not possible to assign typical salt marsh species due to the presence of labile and refractory organic matter that hampers TOC characterization. Tests of this study species? lists with Foram-AMBI on two independent datasets showed a significant correlation between Foram-AMBI and TOC, confirming the strong relation between foraminifera and TOC. For one of the validation datasets, associated macrofaunal data were available and a significant correlation was found between the foraminiferal Foram-AMBI and the macrofaunal AMBI. The here proposed lists should be further tested with sensitivity-based indices in different European regional settings.

TI  - Tidal controls on trace gas dynamics in a seagrass meadow of the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern Portugal)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are important source regions for a variety of trace gases, including halocarbons and sulfur-bearing species. While salt marshes, macroalgae and phyto-plankton communities have been intensively studied, little is known about trace gas fluxes in seagrass meadows. Here we report results of a newly developed dynamic flux chamber system that can be deployed in intertidal areas over full tidal cycles allowing for highly time-resolved measurements. The fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4) and a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) showed a complex dynamic mediated by tide and light. In contrast to most previous studies, our data indicate significantly enhanced fluxes during tidal immersion relative to periods of air exposure. Short emission peaks occurred with onset of the feeder current at the sampling site.We suggest an overall strong effect of advective transport processes to explain the elevated fluxes during tidal immersion. Many emission estimates from tidally influenced coastal areas still rely on measurements carried out during low tide only. Hence, our results may have significant implications for budgeting trace gases in coastal areas. This dynamic flux chamber system provides intensive time series data of community respiration (at night) and net community production (during the day) of shallow coastal systems.

TI  - Hydrochemistry characterisation of protected marine ecosystems in Cadiz
T2  - Boletin Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have a great natural wealth due to their borderline nature, representing the point where lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere converge. The wetlands of Cadiz, at the southern extreme of Europe, also play an important role as a stopover area for migratory birds. This paper presents the results of a sampling project conducted during the spring of 1997 in the Guadiaro and Palmones Rivers, the Barbate estuary, Sancti Petri sound, and the San Pedro River salt marsh. For each system, three sampling stations were established along a salinity gradient, and these variables were measured: salinity, pH and chloride, sulphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, nitrite, nitrate, silicate ammonia, organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations. Several behaviours were found for the various systems: the Guadiaro and Palmones Rivers fit a fluvial estuary pattern, with low ionic concentrations and poor remineralisation. The San Pedro River and Sancti Petri sound are tidal systems with a typical seawater composition and high benthic regeneration. The Barbate estuary represents an intermediate scenario between the preceding ones, with a pronounced salinity gradient along its course.

TI  - Biostratigraphy, palaeoenvironment and sea level changes during pre-collisional (Palaeocene) phase of the Indian plate: palynological evidence from Akli Formation in Giral Lignite Mine, Barmer Basin, Rajasthan, Western India
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - Giral Lignite Mine succession (Akli Formation)from Barmer Basin, Rajasthan yielded rich assemblage of dinoflagellate cysts and compared with the global dinoflagellate zonation schemes, and a Danian-Thanetian age is proposed. Within a precise biostratigraphic control, changes in the terrestrial and marine palynomorphs allowed the construction of relative sea level fluctuation curve and the development of depositonal succession in a sequence stratigraphic framework. Based on the lithological and palynological content, the Giral Lignite Mine succession is divided in to five units. Unit 1 (lower 7.8 m) is interpreted as transgressive deposit formed in an open bay setting during rise in the relative sea level representing the Transgressive Systems Tract (TST). The age is Danian on the basis of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. Unit 2 (16.5 m) consists of5-6 laterally occurring lignite bands. It is deposited during decrease of sea level and increased detritus supply in essentially salt marsh environment during Highstand Systems Tract (HST). Unit 3 (3.42 m) is shallow marine facies ofThanetian age deposited in a restricted setting represents a Transgressive Systems Tract. Unit 4 (0.9 m) is marked by a return to coastal marsh depositional conditions, possibly representing a Highstand Systems Tract. The erosional surface at the top of Unit 4 is interpreted as a Sequence Boundary. Unit 5 (9.3 m) is highly oxydized and is devoid of any organic matter content. Two major marine flooding surfaces identified in the Giral Lignite Mine succession can be correlated with the Maximum Flooding Surfaces (MFS) at 60.7 Ma and 57.9 Ma corresponding to the eustatic curve. Based on the dinoflagellate biostratigraphy Danian- Thanetian age has been assigned to the lignite bearing succession of Giral Mine. Western Indian margin consist of large-scale lignite deposits in Kutch, Cambay and Rajasthan Basin. The proposed Danian-Thanetian age of lignite bearing succession of Giral Mine is much older than the late Thanetian-early Ypresian age of lignite successions of Cambay and Kutch Basins of Gujarat. The present study suggests a significantly diachronous development of lignite deposits on the western peninsular margin of India.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KUWAIT-SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is an attempt to assess the effect of soil salinity and some other environmental factors on the plant community diversity in saline and marshy depressions of the western Mediterranean region of Egypt. The community diversity is negatively correlated with soil salinity and with the other related soil variables (clay, organic matter and water holding capacity). The habitat change, as a result of active sand deposition and process of hummock formation, also has a great impact on community diversity. The plant cover is negatively correlated with diversity. These findings are discussed in terms of adaptation theory.

TI  - Interactions among plant species and microorganisms in salt marsh sediments
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactions among Spartina patens and sediment microbial populations and the interactions among Phragmites australis and sediment microbial populations were studied at monotypic sites in Piermont Marsh, a salt marsh of the Hudson River north of New York N.Y., at key times during the growing season. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) effectively colonized S. patens but not P. australis, and there were seasonal increases and decreases that coincided with plant growth and senescence (17 and 6% of the S. patens root length were colonized, respectively). In sediment samples from the Spartina site, the microbial community and specific bacterial populations were at least twice as large in terms of number and biomass as the microbial community and specific bacterial populations in sediment samples from the Phragmites site, and peak values occurred during reproduction. Members of the domain Bacteria, especially members of the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subdivisions of the Proteobacteria, were the most abundant organisms at both sites throughout the growing season. The populations were generally more dynamic in samples from the Spartina site than in samples from the Phragmites site. No differences between the two sites and no differences during the growing season were observed when restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of nifH amplicons were performed in an attempt to detect shifts in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Differences were observed only in the patterns generated by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR for samples from the Spartina site, suggesting that there were differences in the overall and active populations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Regression analyses indicated that there was a positive interaction between members of the 8-subdivision of the Proteobacteria and root biomass but not between members of the delta-subdivision of the Proteobacteria and macroorganic matter at both sites. In samples from the Spartina site, there were indications that there were bacterium-fungus interactions since populations of members of the a-subdivision of the Proteobacteria were negatively associated with AMF colonization and populations of members of the gamma-subdivision of the Proteobacteria were positively associated with AMF colonization.

TI  - How the litter-feeding bioturbator Orchestia gammarellus promotes late-successional saltmarsh vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, studies on vegetation succession have focused either on plant-plant interactions or on interactions between plants and their physical environment, for example through organic matter build-up and increased nutrient cycling. These interactions can change conditions for macrodetritivores that feed on plant litter, but their role in vegetation succession is rarely studied. In this paper, we explore whether the bioturbating crustacean macrodetritivore Orchestia gammarellus alters soil conditions in a saltmarsh ecosystem in such a way that it promotes late-successional, less stress-tolerant plant species at the expense of early successional species. To answer this, we performed a field and a laboratory experiment in which we manipulated abundances of O.gammarellus, and studied the consequences for soil physical and chemical parameters and for vegetation community composition. Our field experiment showed that O.gammarellus stimulated nitrogen mineralization, likely resulting from the positive effect of this macrodetritivore on soil aeration and litter decomposition. Moreover, results from the laboratory experiment showed that O.gammarellus negatively affected dicot seedling survival of mainly early successional plant species, likely through grazing, thus affecting plant community composition. The experiments together provided evidence that O.gammarellus promotes late-successional plant species in multiple ways: by alleviation of anoxic conditions, by promoting nutrient cycling and by selective herbivory on early successional species.Synthesis. By demonstrating that a species traditionally considered as part of the detrital (brown') food web is thus an important accelerator of vegetation succession, this study documents an important but often overlooked link in food web and ecosystem ecology.

AB  - Various physiological characteristics of C-3 and C-4 plants (14 species) grown along a salinity gradient were studied. The majority of plants occupying salt-marshes were succulent chenopods, mainly C-4 annuals. The ash content of assimilating organs of plants was higher and osmotic potential lower in species grown under increasing soil salinity. The plants of the NADP-ME group accumulated more K than Na. Large amounts of Na+ and Cl- characterized the NAD-ME plants and perennial C-3 plants from sites with high soil salinity. Net photosynthetic rate (P-N) and chlorophyll content were decreased in species grown under high salinity. Dark respiration was depressed by salinity to a lesser extent than P-N.

TI  - Vascular Plants Are Globally Significant Contributors to Marine Carbon Fluxes and Sinks
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 12
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions.

CP  - 10th INTECOL International Wetlands Conference
CL  - Nanjing Univ, Changshu, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Although embankment reclamation is a recurring activity in the coastal wetlands of China, the effect of embankment construction on plant growth has attracted little attention. Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'. However, previously published threshold values of the N:P ratio as indicators of N or P limitation of plant growth may not be applicable to S. alterniflora at our study site.

TI  - Temporal variations and temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration in three brackish marsh communities in the Min River Estuary, southeast China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) is an important pathway for gaseous carbon loss in coastal wetland environments. However, little is known regarding the dynamics of Rem and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) under different tidal stages, and vegetation types. In this study, R-eco was measured with dark chambers for nearly 2 years in three different brackish marsh stands dominated by Cyperus malaccensis, Phragmites australis, and Spartina alterniflora, respectively, in the Min River estuary of southeast China. The mean R-eco, across tidal stages and vegetation types exhibited strong temporal variations, and the Q(10) value for R-eco was higher in the warm months than in the cold months. The mean annual Reco was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity and soil water content, but positively correlated with both tidal water level and soil pH (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the seasonal variation in R-eco and Q(10) was largely driven by the thermal regimes and soil salinity. Also, we found that the mean Reco and Q(s10) value were both relatively higher when the site was exposed before tidal inundation, as compared to that after tidal inundation for all the vegetation types studied (P > 0.05). Overall, the C. malacensis and S. altemiflora stands had the highest and lowest average rates of Reco, respectively, while the mean Q(s10) values were lower in the Phragmites australis stand than the other two vegetation types. Our findings point to the need of strengthening the in situ measurements of gas fluxes at multiple time scales in order to develop a better understanding of the response of Reco to changing environmental conditions in the subtropical coastal wetlands. Our results also reiterate the importance of considering the influence of vegetation types in characterizing the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of Reco in estuarine tidal marshes for predicting ecosystem responses to future global change.

TI  - A comparison of mangrove and marsh influences on soil respiration rates: A mesocosm study
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to reductions in freeze events, mangroves have been rapidly encroaching into previously salt marshdominated coastal wetlands along the northeastern shores of Florida, USA. This shift in dominant wetland vegetation type may have significant implications for belowground processes such as soil organic matter decomposition and respiration. Using a full factorial greenhouse mesocosm experiment, we investigated the effects of plant type (no plant, Avicennia germinans, or Spartina alterniflora) and soil type (sand, mangrove-derived soil, or marsh-derived soil) on estimated heterotrophic soil respiration rates. While we predicted that A. germinans mangrove seedlings would increase heterotrophic respiration, we found that mangrove seedlings did not increase heterotrophic respiration when compared to control (no plant) treatments. Additionally, we found that heterotrophic respiration was higher in marsh-derived soils than in mangrove-derived soils for both control and mangrove plant treatments. Our findings suggest that the stage of mangrove invasion and the level of root development may influence changes in heterotrophic soil respiration.

TI  - Biogeochemical characteristics and fluxes of suspended particulate organic matter in response to low-tide rainfall
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of low-tide rainfall on salt marsh particulate organic carbon (POC) cycling. Suspended sediment samples from intertidal creeks were collected during rain and no-rain conditions. Bulk (carbon, nitrogen) and molecular (e.g., lignin) compositions of organic constituents in particulates were analyzed. Temporal patterns of suspended sediment concentration mimic fluctuations in rainfall intensity, but all POC constituents do not necessarily follow these patterns. For example, particulate organic matter concentrations in water column covaried with rain intensity yet organic matter (OM) contents in the particles showed trivial correlations with rain. In general, rainfall effects raised the suspended sediment and organic constituent concentrations in the water column by up to three orders of magnitude. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the rainfall-entrained particulates were compositionally distinct from calm weather suspended particulates, from salt marsh surface sediment, and from creek bank surface sediment. Rainfall-entrained particulates are depleted in bulk organic carbon and phytoplankton-derived OM but enriched in lignin phenols. These observations indicate that rainfall-runoff processes preferentially mobilize POC derived from Spartina alterniflora from marsh platforms and effectively transport these materials to intertidal creeks following low-tide rainfall events. Moreover, average net transport rates by rainfall are 0.020 +/- 0.002 gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1), and this POC turnover rate amounts to similar to 19% of the annual POC export from estuary to ocean. Therefore, estuarine outwelling estimates typically made under calm weather conditions represent minimum levels of POC export. Hence, low-tide rainfall can be expected to substantially enhance the delivery of marsh-derived POC to the coastal ocean.

AB  - Sediment samples from a salt marsh habitat in the vicinity of Linden Chemical Plant (LCP) Superfund site in Brunswick Georgia, USA, were analyzed for the composition of total solvent extracts and sources of lipid compounds. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis infer past multiple sources of organic matter (OM) from aquatic and terrestrial origin, e.g., phytoplankton, bacteria, and land plants, as well as anthropogenic contamination. The n-alkane and n-alkanol distributions in the sediment samples were dominated by long-chain homologues maximizing at C-25-C-27 for alkanes (carbon preference index (CPI) similar to 1) and C-32 for nalkanols indicating inputs from higher plants, but also microbial and petroleum-related sources. Fatty acid distribution was characterized by short-chain (< C-18) and branched homologues indicative of bacterial origin. The high abundance of dehydroabietic acid and anthropogenic contaminants, including alkylphenols, are indicative of the effects of past industrial activities in the LCP marsh area in Brunswick, Georgia.

T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sedimentary characteristics and processes on an estuarine marsh island in the Yangtze Estuary (East China Sea) show that (1) the mean grain size of the surficial sediments varies between 0.003 and 0.16 mm, the finest sediment being more enriched in the marsh center particularly under calm weather conditions during the flood season, and the coarsest sediment being more enriched on the low seaward tidal flats particularly after storms; (2) the sediment organic carbon content is generally less than 1.4 wt%; (3) the annual vertical marsh accretion is in the range of 20 cm, with a maximum value of 40 cm in the middle of the marsh; and (4) the seasonal cycle in plant growth strongly influences sediment grain size and erosion-accretion events.

TI  - Algal-Induced Biogeomorphic Feedbacks Lay the Groundwork for Coastal Wetland Development
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem establishment under adverse geophysical conditions is often studied within the "windows of opportunity" framework, identifying disturbance-free periods (e.g., calm wave climate) where species can overcome establishment thresholds. However, the role of biogeophysical interactions in this framework is less well understood. The establishment of saltmarsh vegetation on tidal flats, for example, is limited by abiotic factors such as hydrodynamics, sediment stability and drainage. On tidal flats, raised sediment ridges colonized by algal mats (Vaucheria sp.) appear to accomodate high densities of plant seedlings. Such ridges were previously found to have higher sediment strength than substratum without algae. Here, we investigate whether these measurements can be explained by geophysical factors only, or that biological (Vaucheria-induced) processes influence tidal marsh establishment by forming stabilized bedforms. We performed two experiments under controlled mesocosm conditions, to test the hypotheses that (a) Vaucheria grows better on elevated topographic relief, that (b) the binding force of their algal filaments increases sediment strength, and that (c) Vaucheria consequently creates elevated topographic relief that further facilitates algal growth. Our experimental results confirm the existence of this algal-induced biogeomorphic feedback cycle. These findings imply that benthic algae like Vaucheria may contribute significantly to tidal marsh formation by creating elevated and stabilized substratum. This suggests biogeophysical feedbacks can "widen" the windows of opportunity for further ecosystem establishment. Our results could be useful for the design of managed realignment projects aimed at restoring the unique ecosystem services of coastal wetlands, such as habitat biodiversity, carbon sequestration potential and nature-based flood defense.

TI  - Habitat segregation of two dotillid crabs Scopimera globosa and Ilyoplax pusilla in relation to their cellulase activity on a marsh-dominated estuarine tidal flat in central Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to clarify the relationship between cellulase activity and habitat segregation for two dotillid crabs - Scopimera globosa and Ilyoplax pusilla - on the marsh-dominated Tanakagawa tidal flat in central Japan. Both species are deposit feeders, and represent the dominant crab species in the study area. S. globosa was found to occur within sandy sediment habitats on the tidal flat, while I. pusilla occurred in both muddy sediment on the tidal flat and salt marsh habitats. This study was the first to detect cellulase activity in dotillid crabs. Cellulase activity was detected for both species; I. pusilla was found to exhibit significantly higher activity than S. globosa. Organic matter content, which is known to have a strong positive correlation with the cellulose content of sediments in estuarine areas, was higher in the sediments of muddy and salt marsh habitats compared with those in sandy habitats. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the habitat segregation of these two crabs and their cellulase activity. Given that cellulose is abundant in refractory organic materials and is a major component of food resources in tidal flat sediments, it is likely that these two crab species, especially I. pusilla, would play an important role in material cycling in tidal flat and estuarine areas.

TI  - Trace metal concentrations in soil-plant complex in rocky shore salt marshes of Central Patagonia
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and industrialization involve environmental problems, such as metal pollution, and coastal environments are particularly susceptible to such issues. Within this framework, we aimed: (i) to determine the levels of trace metals in soils and Spartina densiflora tissues in rocky shore marshes of Central Patagonia; (ii) to relate metal concentration patterns in the different soil-plant complex fractions to environmental conditions; and (iii) to investigate whether geographical metal concentration patterns can be explained with anthropogenic influences and sources and/or by local prevailing biogeochemical processes. For this purpose, soil samples and associated vegetation were collected in five rocky shore marshes located at different distances from an urban or industrial area. The concentration of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in soils (pseudototal and bioavailable) and in plants (roots and shoots) was determined. Then the enrichment factor, bioaccumulation and translocation factor were calculated. The soil mineralogy and the behavior of these metals according to different soil variables were discussed. The results showed different behavior and level of anthropic impact according to the metal considered. Salt marshes located on the southern edge of the Nuevo Gulf showed the highest concentrations of metals. Fe, Al, Cu and Zn showed mostly a natural origin. Fe and Al were mainly in soils rather than in plants, while Cu and Zn were similarly distributed in both matrixes. Although Cd in soils showed enrichment, it would have a natural origin. Also, it was scarce in the soil and was mostly concentrated in Spartina' roots. Pb, Cr and Ni showed anthropic enrichment too, being mainly derived from the port and industrial activities. Pb had significant representation in all soil-plant subsystems and showed the highest bioavailability in soils. Cr and Ni, were found in high concentration in the soil and showed a high bioaccumulation in roots. The human impact level in rocky shore marshes of the Nuevo Gulf in Central Patagonia associated to the trace metals pollution varies from being scarce to significantly important, with the marshes located in its southern margin showing the worst scenarios.

AB  - For effective conservation of endangered wild plants, it is necessary to understand their interactions with environmental factors in each habitat together with life traits of target species. First, the characteristics of their distribution were investigated followed by their monitoring for 4 years focusing on the habitats in the lagoon. Also, their life traits were compared including production of hibernacles, fruits, and seeds by the soil fertilization and light intensities. Next, the information on the species was secured by germination experiment using the generated seeds from the cultivation experiment. The habitat of Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald in Korea was located in the rear edge of the worldwide distribution and its four habitats were isolated and distributed far away each other. Two of them were located in small salt-marsh and fine sand estuaries formed in the rocky area of the seashore, and the other two were inhabited with the sandy soil in the lagoon which was connected by river-mouth to the sea. Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald tends to be distributed in the sites where the establishment and growth of the competitor were inhibited by salinity, periodic flooding, and lower layer of the soil to extend a roots. It maintained its population by recruitments of hibernacles and seedling. The production of hibernacle was assumed to be affected by the particle consist of the sand together with organic matters in the soil. Seedling recruitment was observed only in the salt-marsh area located in the rear sites of sand ridge where was the shore of the lagoon. Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald was observed to have different threatening factors by each population. Its population in Pohang seemed the sedimentation of fine sand which affected the recruitment of hibernacles had been eroded due to the construction of the coastal road. The population in Ulsan appeared rapid expansion of competitor and reduction of its distribution area due to the interruption of eluted water supplied to the habitat. On the other hand, the habitat in the lagoon maintained the population relatively stable. Especially, the population in Songji-ho was determined to be the most stable one. To sustain the population of Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia Fernald distributed in the lagoon, it is suggested that the wide ranged scale of conservational activities is necessary to maintain the mechanisms including the entrance of seawater which belongs to the lagoon, and periodic flooding.

TI  - Do we have enough pieces of the jigsaw to integrate CO2 fluxes in the coastal ocean?
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Annually integrated air-water CO2 flux data in 44 coastal environments were compiled from literature. Data were gathered in 8 major ecosystems (inner estuaries, outer estuaries, whole estuarine systems, mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs, upwelling systems, and open continental shelves), and up-scaled in the first attempt to integrate air-water CO2 fluxes over the coastal ocean (26 x 10(6) km(2)), taking into account its geographical and ecological diversity. Air-water CO2 fluxes were then up-scaled in global ocean (362 x 10(6) km(2)) using the present estimates for the coastal ocean and those from Takahashi et al. (2002) for the open ocean (336 x 106 km(2)). If estuaries and salt marshes are not taken into consideration in the up-scaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a sink for atmospheric CO2 (-1.17 Mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the global ocean increases by 24% (-1.93 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). The inclusion of the coastal ocean increases the estimates of CO2 uptake by the global ocean by 57% for high latitude areas (-0.44 versus -0.28 Pg C yr(-1)) and by 15% for temperate latitude areas (-2.36 versus -2.06 Pg C yr(-1)). At subtropical and tropical latitudes, the contribution from the coastal ocean increases the CO2 emission to the atmosphere from the global ocean by 13% (0.87 versus 0.77 Pg C yr(-1)). If estuaries and salt marshes are taken into consideration in the upscaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 (0.38 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 from the global ocean decreases by 12% (-1.44 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). At high and subtropical and tropical latitudes, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 but at temperate latitudes, it still behaves as a moderate CO2 sink. A rigorous tip-scaling of air-water CO2 fluxes in the coastal ocean is hampered by the poorly constrained estimate of the surface area of inner estuaries. The present estimates clearly indicate the significance of this biogeochemicatly. highly active region of the biosphere in the global CO2 cycle.

TI  - Remotely-Sensed Indicators of N-Related Biomass Allocation in Schoenoplectus acutus
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root: shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, (549) was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root: shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deteriorating of urban river environment in Yangzhou is gradually serious in recent years. Treatment measures including pollution source control, sewage interception, and sludge dredging have been carried out in recent years, but urban river environment is still poor. In order to ascertain the causes, post-dredging effects were assessed based on sediment chemical quality in urban rivers of Yangzhou. Results indicate that post-dredging effects are not ideal because of backward dredging technique and incomplete pollution control. Eutrophication degree is still relatively high for most of them and pollution degree of nutrients is total phosphorus (TP) > total nitrogen (TN) > organic matter (OM). Although the pollution of heavy metals is not serious, the major pollution factors Cd and Hg should still be monitored intensively in the sludge dredging for the toxic effect of heavy metals.

TI  - Invasion and ecological effects of exotic smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) was introduced to China in December 1979 to buffer against fides and to accelerate coastal wetland accretion. Since then, its propagation and natural dispersal have allowed this exotic plant to rapidly expand throughout coastal China with generally negative ecological effects. In 2003 S. alterniflora was labeled as an invasive plant in China, and it now covers similar to 50,000 ha. In this review, we first summarize the mechanisms of spread and spatial distribution of S. alterniflora, and how its physiological characteristics and strong adaptability to the available niche space in China's wetlands have enabled its spread and competition with native plants. Then we review the effects of S. alterniflora on ecosystem function in terms of habitat conversion and the alteration of biodiversity, soil carbon flux and sequestration, and various processes of nutrient regulation. We conclude that we need a long-term and context-dependent perspective, in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of S. alterniflora within each of China's unique provinces.

TI  - The effect of mercury and PCBs on organisms from lower trophic levels of a Georgia salt marsh
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined several indicators of salt marsh function, focusing on primary producers, microbes, and grass shrimp, at a Superfund site (LCP) contaminated with mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and a reference site (Cross-River) in Georgia. Primary production of Spartina alterniflora was assessed by measuring peroxidase activity (POD), glutathione concentration (tGSH), photosynthesis (A(net)), and transpiration (E). Microbial populations were assessed by measuring living-fungal standing crop (as ergosterol) and Microtox(R). Grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) reproductive potential was determined by measuring individual egg mass, average egg area, brood size, and brood mass of gravid females. Comparison of the sites suggested that P. pugio reproduction was affected at the LCP site, but we were unable to document clear negative effects on other organisms we investigated. Due to natural environmental gradients, the Cross-River site may not have been a perfect control for the LCP site. Therefore, data from just the LCP site were reanalyzed using multiple regression. Fungal biomass was related to methylmercury concentrations, but the direction of the relationship differed between wholly dead shoots (positive) and partially dead shoots (negative). S. alterniflora POD was positively related to methylmercury concentrations; S. alterniflora A(net) and E were negatively related to elevation and salinity, respectively. Despite high levels of contamination at the LCP site, our results provided only suggestive evidence for impacts on organisms at lower trophic levels.

TI  - Community Structure and Abundance of Benthic Infaunal Invertebrates in Maine Fringing Marsh Ecosystems
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fringing marshes are abundant ecosystems that dominate the New England coastline. Despite their abundance, very little baseline data is available from them and few studies have documented the ecosystems services that they provide. This information is important for conservation efforts as well as for an increased understanding of how fringing marshes function compared to larger marsh meadow systems. Benthic infaunal invertebrates were sampled from cores collected from Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh, Spartina patens-dominated high marsh, and Phragmites australis-invaded high marsh zones of nine fringing marsh ecosystems in Casco Bay, Maine, USA. Infaunal densities and biomass were generally higher in low marsh than high marsh or P. australis cores. Invertebrate community structure was significantly different between low marsh and high marsh and P. australis cores, which was attributed to significantly higher pore water salinity, lower organic matter, total plant percent cover, and S. patens cover in low marsh zones. There were no differences in invertebrate densities, biomass, or community structure when high marsh and P. australis cores were compared. Invertebrate densities and community structure were dominated by oligochaetes in all zones. Oligochaetes were also an important component of infaunal biomass, but the less abundant and larger invertebrates such as green crabs, tanaids, and bivalves were also large contributors to biomass in the low marsh zone. Low marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by significantly higher densities of nematodes, Nereis virens, an unidentified oligochaete, the bivalves Gemma gemma and Mya arenaria, and Leptochelia rapax. High marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by higher densities of insects, specifically Culicoides sp. ceratopogonid larvae and Anurida maritima, as well as an unidentified species of mite. Our results revealed a diverse and abundant infaunal invertebrate community that likely supports similar ecosystem services in fringing marshes as invertebrates in larger marsh meadows.

M3  - Review
CP  - Symposium on Geochemical Transformations of Sedimentary Sulfur, at the 208th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society
CL  - WASHINGTON, D.C.
AB  - Salinity and organic matter loading gradients in estuaries can be used to examine iron sulfide mineral formation. Chesapeake Bay has low salinity, terrestrially-dominated sediments in the northern bay, seasonally anoxic mesohaline environments in the mid-bay region, and coarser-grained, bioturbated sediments in the more saline southern bay. High rates of sediment sulfur reoxidation and low inputs of labile organic matter limit the burial of authigenic sulfide minerals in northern bay sediments, while the activity of bioturbating organisms in south bay sediments enhances the reoxidation of sulfur. High iron sulfide delta(34)S values in the northern bay are consistent with low sulfate concentrations. A strong bay-wide relationship between organic carbon and iron sulfide concentrations was evident when refractory terrestrial organic matter was considered.

TI  - Redox speciation and early diagenetic behavior of dissolved molybdenum in sulfidic muds
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to further elucidate the early diagenetic behavior of Mo, we examined the redox speciation of dissolved Mo in organic rich sediment from a back-barrier salt marsh environment in eastern Long Island (Flax Pond, NY). Total dissolved Mo (Sigma Mo) was similar to 80 nM in surface nonsulfidic porewater, dominantly as Mo (VI). Sigma Mo increased up to 150 nM at a depth of 3.5 cm with low sulfide content (Sigma H2S: 25-100 mu M), and Mo (V) reached 20 nM. Sigma Mo decreased to similar to 70 nM at a depth of 7.5 cm in highly sulfidic deep sediment porewater (Sigma H2S: > 100 mu M) with Mo(V) accounting for similar to 10%. Mo(VI) dominated residual Sigma Mo, likely as MoS42-. Averaged in situ Mo speciation patterns are complicated by mixed redox conditions created by biogenic structures and reworking. Serial anoxic incubation of surface sediments revealed reductive redox reaction progression without complications from transport and biogenic microenvironments: Mo(VI) dominated initially, followed by increases in Sigma Mo (dMo/dt similar to 7 nM/h) and production of Mo(V) under low sulfide conditions (Sigma H2S: 25-100 mu M; Mo(V) as high as 160 nM). Mo(V) was subsequently lost rapidly from solution (dMo(V)/dt similar to-5 nM/h) and residual Sigma Mo, presumably a mixture of Mo(VI) and a small percentage of Mo(IV), was gradually reestablished under highly sulfidic conditions (Sigma H2S > 100 mu M). Mo(V) is clearly produced as a transient dissolved intermediate during reductive redox reaction succession. Mo(V) may react with particles or disproportionate in the presence of polysulfides into Mo(IV), which likely rapidly adsorbs-precipitates as pyritic Mo-Fe-S, sulfidized organic complexes, or perhaps MoS2. Mo(VI), which remains, at least temporarily in solution as thiomolybdate is removed more slowly. In contrast to reductive reactions, reoxidation of reduced sediment results in rapid release of Mo dominated by Mo(VI). Dynamic diagenetic cycling and the existence of Mo(V) as a dissolved reaction intermediate must be accounted for in models of Mo fixation and associated isotopic fractionation in sulfidic deposits.

TI  - Identification and Prioritization of Management Practices to Reduce Methylmercury Exports from Wetlands and Irrigated Agricultural Lands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta's (Delta) beneficial uses for humans and wildlife are impaired by elevated methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in fish. MeHg is a neurotoxin that bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs. The total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation plan aimed at reducing MeHg in Delta fish obligates dischargers to conduct MeHg control studies. Over 150 stakeholders collaborated to identify 24 management practices (MPs) addressing MeHg nonpoint sources (NPS) in three categories: biogeochemistry (6), hydrology (14), and soil/vegetation (4). Land uses were divided into six categories: permanently and seasonally flooded wetlands, flooded and irrigated agricultural lands, floodplains, and brackish-fresh tidal marshes. Stakeholders scored MPs based on seven criteria: scientific certainty, costs, MeHg reduction potential, spatial applicability, technical capacity to implement, negative impacts to beneficial uses, and conflicting requirements. Semi-quantitative scoring for MPs applicable to each land use (totaling > 400 individual scores) led to consensus-based prioritization. This process relied on practical experience from diverse and accomplished NPS stakeholders and synthesis of 17 previous studies. Results provide a comprehensive, stakeholder-driven prioritization of MPs for wetland and irrigated agricultural land managers. Final prioritization highlights the most promising MPs for practical application and control study, and a secondary set of MPs warranting further evaluation. MPs that address hydrology and soil/vegetation were prioritized because experiences were positive and implementation appeared more feasible. MeHg control studies will need to address the TMDL conundrum that MPs effective at reducing MeHg exports could both exacerbate MeHg exposure and contend with other management objectives on site.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Bioresources, Energy, Environment, and Materials Technology (BEEM) / Symposium on Sediment Pollution Assessment and Remediation/Management
CL  - Hongcheon, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The interactive effects of salinity and moisture on the net nitrogen mineralization were seldom studied in coastal wetlands. To reveal the phenomenons and mechanisms of salinity and moisture effects, we conducted a 30-days laboratory experiment with different salt addition levels (0, ppt, 5 ppt and 35 ppt) and moisture levels (10%, 50% and 100% of water holding capacity (WHC)), and the key N transformation rates and enzymes activities were measured. Our results showed that during the incubation, the rates of soil net nitrogen mineralization (R-min) and nitrification (Rint) under all treatments, increased during 0-1 day, decreased during 1-3 days, then increased and kept around zero. As incubation time increased, urease activities increased, arylamidase activities decreased and fluorescein diacetate activities increased first and then decreased. Increasing salinity under high moisture (100% WHC) treatments and increasing moisture under high salinity (35 ppt) treatments would promote R-min and R-nit. Whereas, increasing salinity under low moisture (10% WHC) treatments, and increasing moisture under low salinity (0 ppt) treatments would suppress R-min and R-nit. The responses of enzyme activities to salinity and moisture gradients almost correspond with R-min, indicating salinity and moisture could affect N transformation by the regulation of related microbial enzyme activities.

TI  - Effects of landscape variables and season on reference water chemistry of coastal marshes in eastern Georgian Bay
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We surveyed 34 marshes in relatively pristine Precambrian Shield catchments in Georgian Bay and related water chemistry to a suite of landscape-level variables, including characteristics of the marsh and its drainage basin. The first landscape principal component (explained 48% of variation) ordered marshes along a gradient with high values corresponding to marshes with large watersheds that contain extensive upstream wetland and that receive relatively high precipitation inputs. This axis was negatively related to specific conductivity, pH, nitrate nitrogen, and SO42- concentrations and positively related to total phosphorus, colour, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, and summer dissolved organic carbon. Stepwise regression models built using catchment- and marsh-level variables explained up to 64% of the variation in water chemistry variables. Average precipitation and snowmelt inputs to the catchments were first to enter the majority of models, alone explaining up to 43% of the variation (in the case of water colour), while drainage area alone explained 44% of the variation in pH. Concentrations of catchment-derived constituents in marshes were highest in spring, reflecting greater loadings from the watersheds, while ionic strength was highest during summer, reflecting increased contributions form other sources (i.e., lake water).

TI  - The role of organic matter in the sorption capacity of marine sediments
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Past studies have suggested that desiccation enhances hydrophobicity of salt marsh sediment, and that drying and rewetting sediment can be used to investigate sorption mechanisms of amino acids and other organic compounds [Liu, Z., Lee, C., 2006. Drying effects on sorption capacity of coastal sediment: The importance of architecture and polarity of organic matter. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 70, 3313-3324]. Here we further develop this technique to study sorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic compounds in a wide range of marine sediments. Our results show that hydrophilic compounds sorb strongly to wet coastal sediments; in dried sediments, sorption of hydrophilic compounds decreases, while sorption of hydrophobic compounds is greatly enhanced. Small compounds with aromatic rings sorb more in dried than wet coastal sediments, suggesting that aromatic groups have a stronger effect on sorption than polar groups like amino and carboxyl moieties. Sorption of lysine, glutamic acid and putrescine decreases greatly when sediment is pretreated with KCl, indicating the importance of cation ion exchange. However, alpha-amino acids sorb much more than corresponding beta- or -gamma-amino acids, and L-alanine sorbs more than D-alanine, suggesting that amino group location and chiral selectivity play an important role in sorption. Comparison of lysine and tyrosine sorption in different sediments indicates that source and diagenetic state of organic matter are important factors determining sorption capacity. Lysine sorbs much more to organic detritus from salt marsh sediment than to fresh Spartina root materials, marine particles, lignin or hurnic acids, indicating the importance of structural integrity in sorption. Desorption hysteresis of glutamic acid, putrescine and lysine (in dried sediment) suggests the presence of enzyme-type sorption sites of high sorption energy or multiple binding mechanisms. Taken together, these findings suggest that organic matter plays the major role in amino acid sorption in organic-rich sediments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study determined the plant biomass (aboveground and belowground) of Salicornia brachiata from six different salt marshes distributed in Indian coastal area over one growing season (September 2014-May 2015). The nutrients concentration and their pools were estimated in plant as well as soil. Belowground biomass in S. brachiata was usually lower than the aboveground biomass. Averaged over different locations, highest biomass was observed in the month of March (2.1tha(-1)) followed by May (1.64tha(-1)), February (1.60tha(-1)), November (0.82tha(-1)) and September (0.05tha(-1)). The averaged aboveground to belowground ratio was 12.0. Aboveground and belowground biomass were negatively correlated with pH of soil, while positively with soil electrical conductivity. Further, there were positive relationships between organic carbon and belowground biomass; and available sodium and aboveground biomass. The nutrient pools in aboveground were always higher than to belowground biomass. Aboveground pools of carbon (543kgha(-1)), nitrogen (48kgha(-1)), phosphorus (4kgha(-1)), sodium (334kgha(-1)) and potassium (37kgha(-1)) were maximum in the month of March 2015. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors for sodium of S. brachiata were more than one showing tolerance to salinity and capability of phytoremediation for the saline soil.

TI  - Distribution of organic matter in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and their stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios: Implications for source discrimination and sedimentary dynamics
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as stable carbon (delta C-13(org)) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic ratios were determined on suspended matter, settling particles and bottom sediments collected from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary during the summer flood period in 2001. From the results, three sources of suspended matter, riverine, deltaic (salt marshes) and marine (East China Sea - ECS) were distinguished. The resuspended particulate organic matter contents in the water column increased with the amount of total suspended matter (TSM) indicating the role of dispersive and/or turbulent mixing and its control over the high TSM concentration in the Changjiang Estuary. This and an active resuspension/deposition in the estuary determine the nature of organic matter in suspended materials reaching the East China Sea. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Developmental change in CO2 compensation concentrations in Spartina alterniflora results from sigmoidal photosynthetic CO2 responses
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated seasonal patterns of photosynthetic responses to CO2 concentrations in Spartina alterniflora Loisel, an aerenchymous halophyte grass, from a salt marsh of the Bay of Fundy (NB, Canada), and from plants grown from rhizome in controlled-environment chambers. From late May to August, CO2 compensation concentrations (Gamma) of field-grown leaves varied between 2.5-10.7 cm(3) (CO2) m(-3), with a mean of 5.4 cm(3)(CO2) m(-3). From September onwards field leaves showed CO2 compensation concentrations from 6.6-21.1 cm(3) (CO2) m(-3), with a mean of 13.1 cm(3) m(-3) Well into the C-3-C-4 intermediate range. The seasonal variability in Gamma did not result from changing respiration, but rather from a sigmoidal response of net photosynthetic rate (P-N) to applied CO2 concentration, found in all tested leaves but which became more pronounced late in the season. One explanation for the sigmoidal response of P-N to external CO2 concentration could be internal delivery Of CO2 from roots and rhizomes to bundle sheath cells via the acrenchyma, but the sigmoidal responses in S. alterniflora persisted out to the tips of leaves, while the aerenchyma extend only to midleaf. The siginoidicity persisted when CO2 response curves were measured from low to high CO2, or from high to low CO2, and even when prolonged acclimation times were used at each CO2 concentration.

TI  - Geochemical mapping of a blue carbon zone: Investigation of the influence of riverine input on tidal affected zones in Bull Island
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bull Island (BI) is a coastal sand spit that formed as an unintended consequence of the construction of two walls, built over 200 years ago in Dublin Port, Ireland to alleviate silting of the shipping route. A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon (SL) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon (NL) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats (MF) and vegetated saltmarshes (SM). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across BI's sediments, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon's (PAH's) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon. This study highlights the ability of a functioning coastal wetland to flourish and sequester elevated levels of carbon, metals and pollutants under the constraints of increasing anthropogenic impact. As the inadvertent result of geo-engineering, BI and its environs is a very important site to investigate the potential of artificially constructed wetlands to act as blue carbon reservoirs.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study are to investigate distribution of trace elements and heavy metals in the salt marsh and wetland soil and biogeochemical processes in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results show that Hg, Cd and to some extent, As and Pb have been significantly accumulated in soils. The strongest correlations were found between concentrations of Ni and total organic matter contents. The correlations decreased in the order: Ni > Cr > Sr > Co > Zn, Cd > Cu > Cs. Strong correlations were also observed between total P and concentrations of Ni, Co, Cr, Sr, Zn, Cu, and Cd. This may be related to the P spilling accident in 2005 in the Bangs Lake site. Lead isotopic ratios in soils matched well those of North American coals, indicating the contribution of Pb through atmospheric fallout from coal power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Photochemical and biophysical feedbacks of C-3 and C-4 Mediterranean halophytes to atmospheric CO2 enrichment confirmed by their stable isotope signatures
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - According the latest predictions, an increase of about two times in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is expected to occur by the end of this century. In order to understand the effects of this atmospheric composition changes on two abundant Mediterranean halophytes (Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima), mesocosmos trials were performed simulating two atmospheric CO2 environments (380 ppm and 760 ppm of CO2 respectively). The two chosen halophyte species present different metabolic characteristics: H. portulacoides, is a C3 specie while S. maritima is a C-4 species. Distinct feedbacks were obtained for each of the studied species. Stable Isotope discrimination showed that both species showed an enhancement of the Rubisco carboxylation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency mostly due to an increase in intracellular [CO2]. In H. portulacoides CO2 fertilization induced an enhancement of ETR and a decrease in non-photochemical quenching and in dissipated energy fluxes. On the other hand the C-4 grass S. maritima, already at full capacity, showed no photosynthetic enhancement. In fact this highly productive grass presented lower photosynthetic efficiencies accompanied by increases in dissipated energy fluxes mostly due to reductions in energy flux associated with the transport of reducing power throughout the quinone pool. The accumulation of reducing power led to oxidative stress, and thus the photosynthetic ability of this grass was greatly reduced. Both these feedbacks to realistic future CO2 concentrations are important consideration for in future primary productivity models, indicating a possible reduced abundance of the pioneer S. maritima and an increased biomass spreading of the sediment stabilizer H. portulacoides, inevitably affecting the morphology and function of the salt marshes imposed by these atmospheric changes, both in terms of ecosystem functioning and loss of biodiversity.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - DEVERRA regions characterized by strong climatic changes that affect production of bioactive natural products. In Egypt, it is widespread on the North-Western Coast and Western and Eastern deserts. It is used in folk medicine and as fuelwood by local inhabitants. in the present study, qualitative and quantitative tests were performed to investigate the main chemical constituents (primary and secondary metabolites) of D. tortuosa collected from 17 locations representing seven different habitats. The study also aims to clarify the effect of several environmental conditions on the main biochemical components of the plant. in the present study, D. tortuosa grew in adverse environments, particularly in sununer, which improved the production and accumulation of some antioxidant compounds, including tannins, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, phenols, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. D. tortuosa produced a high content of total carbohydrates (32.18% in salt marshes, which recorded the highest EC,0.54mS/cm), crude protein (19.88% in sand flats), total alkaloids (111.5mg/g on roadsides, which also recorded the lowest content of organic carbon, 0.16%), total tannins and flavonoids (17.76 and 73.56mg/g, respectively in fig fields, which were characterized by high soil pH, 7.8). Therefore, D. tortuosa shrubs preferred an arid environment and can be considered a new source of several different metabolites that can contribute to drug improvement. In addition, the study provides insight into unusual strategies to increase the efficiency of wild plants for accumulation of phytochemicals.

TI  - Microplastics affect sedimentary microbial communities and nitrogen cycling
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous in estuarine, coastal, and deep sea sediments. The impacts of microplastics on sedimentary microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles, however, have not been well reported. To evaluate if microplastics influence the composition and function of sedimentary microbial communities, we conducted a microcosm experiment using salt marsh sediment amended with polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam (PUF) or polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics. We report that the presence of microplastics alters sediment microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling processes. Compared to control sediments without microplastic, PUF- and PLA-amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification, while PVC amendment inhibits both processes. These results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes in sediments can be significantly affected by different microplastics, which may serve as organic carbon substrates for microbial communities. Considering this evidence and increasing microplastic pollution, the impact of plastics on global ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling merits critical investigation. Plastic pollution has infiltrated every ecosystem, but few studies have quantified the biogeochemical or ecological effects of plastic. Here the authors show that microplastics in ocean sediment can significantly alter microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling.

T2  - RADIOCARBON
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the large basin area of the Caspian Sea, fluctuations in its level reflect climatic changes in the northern hemisphere. To reconstruct these fluctuations, I collected mollusk shells, plant debris, carbonates and organic matter samples for C-14 dating from deposits of ancient salt marshes, depressions and bars formed during significant sea-level decline. I studied the impact of eolian sedimentation via parallel dating of carbonates and other materials. The data demonstrate that sea level rises during periods of cooling and falls during warming periods; this is true for both long-term (2-2.5 ka) and short-term climatic changes.

TI  - Benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon in three temperate Australian estuaries: Implications for global estimates of benthic DOC fluxes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Light and dark benthic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes and sediment characteristics (total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), TOC isotope ratio (delta C-13), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration, and compound-specific delta C-13) were measured seasonally in a range of habitats in three warm-temperate Australian estuaries to determine what factors control benthic DOC fluxes. Benthic DOC fluxes were seasonal with the highest rates generally observed during summer. Most habitats displayed uptake of DOC during the dark and efflux during the light, and were a net source of DOC to the overlying waters over the diel cycle. Macrophyte habitats (seagrass and macroalgae) had the highest benthic fluxes of DOC (up to similar to 50 mmol C m (2) d (1)). Organic matter supply to the sediment was dominated by in situ production, and both quantity and source exerted control over benthic DOC fluxes. DOC flux was tightly coupled to bacteria and algal PLFA concentrations during summer, and algal PLFA concentrations during winter, indicating a strong influence of microbial interactions on benthic DOC flux and a temperature-related decoupling of algae and bacteria under cooler conditions. Estimates of the global estuarine benthic DOC flux indicate that these areas are a significant source of DOC to the ocean (1-41 Tg C yr(-1)). Inclusion of macrophyte, salt marsh, mangrove, and intertidal benthic DOC flux estimates resulted in a higher global continental margin benthic DOC flux (106-416 Tg C yr(-1)) than the previous estimate (90 Tg C yr(-1)).

TI  - Environmental effects of ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change: Progress report, 2007
T2  - PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This year the Montreal Protocol celebrates its 20th Anniversary. In September 1987, 24 countries signed the 'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer'. Today 191 countries have signed and have met strict commitments on phasing out of ozone depleting substances with the result that a 95% reduction of these substances has been achieved. The Montreal Protocol has also contributed to slowing the rate of global climate change, since most of the ozone depleting substances are also effective greenhouse gases. Even though much has been achieved, the future of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on full compliance of the Montreal Protocol by all countries for the remaining substances, including methyl bromide, as well as strict monitoring of potential risks from the production of substitute chemicals. Also the ozone depleting substances existing in banks and equipment need special attention to prevent their release to the stratosphere. Since many of the ozone depleting substances already in the atmosphere are long-lived, recovery cannot be immediate and present projections estimate a return to pre-1980 levels by 2050 to 2075. It has also been predicted that the interactions of the effects of the ozone layer and that of other climate change factors will become increasingly important.

TI  - PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN AN OLIGOHALINE TIDAL MARSH
T2  - VEGETATIO
M3  - Article
AB  - An oligohaline tidal marsh on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, LA was characterized with respect to the distributions and abundances of plant species over spatial and temporal gradients using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA).  In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA).  The distributions of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter.  They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity).  Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake.  Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens.  The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland.  Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions.  We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake.  Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community.  The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials.  Most of the annuals frequently co-occurred with Sagittaria lancifolia, which was the shortest in stature and had the least persistent canopy of the three mid-seasonal dominant perennials.

TI  - ORGANIC-CARBON FLUXES BETWEEN A HIGH MARSH AND ESTUARY, AND THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE OUTWELLING HYPOTHESIS
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal fluxes of total (TOC), dissolved (DOG) and suspended particulate (POC) organic carbon were measured between a high, Sarcocornia- Chenolea salt marsh and Kariega estuary, South Africa. Fluxes were measured over 42 tides, through four (7 to 14 d) sampling periods. The marsh showed an annual export of TOC of +16 gC m(-2) yr(-1), with 80% of this occurring in dissolved form. The export was equivalent to 6% of the aerial macrophyte production of the marsh. In both absolute terms, and relative to macrophyte production, the fluxes were similar to those reported for high elevation, Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata marshes on the east coast of the USA. They were, however, an order of magnitude smaller than for most tow, Spartina alterniflora marshes. A carbon budget developed for the Kariega marsh showed that respiration (mainly by the sediments and to a lesser extent by resident crabs) accounted for 70% of marsh production, leaving 30% for burial or export to the estuary. We speculate that the small export was a function of the high elevation of the marsh, and that the Outwelling Hypothesis may be less applicable to high than low marshes.

TI  - Where temperate meets tropical: multi-factorial effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen enrichment, and competition on a mangrove-salt marsh community
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our understanding of how elevated CO2 and interactions with other factors will affect coastal plant communities is limited. Such information is particularly needed for transitional communities where major vegetation types converge. Tropical mangroves (Avicennia germinans) intergrade with temperate salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and this transitional community represents an important experimental system to test hypotheses about global change impacts on critical ecosystems. We examined the responses of A. germinans (C-3) and S. alterniflora (C-4), grown in monoculture and mixture in mesocosms for 18 months, to interactive effects of atmospheric CO2 and pore water nitrogen (N) concentrations typical of these marshes. A. germinans, grown without competition from S. alterniflora, increased final biomass (35%) under elevated CO2 treatment and higher N availability. Growth of A. germinans was severely curtailed, however, when grown in mixture with S. alterniflora, and enrichment with CO2 and N could not reverse this growth suppression. A field experiment using mangrove seedlings produced by CO2- and N-enriched trees confirmed that competition from S. alterniflora suppressed growth under natural conditions and further showed that herbivory greatly reduced survival of all seedlings. Thus, mangroves will not supplant marsh vegetation due to elevated CO2 alone, but instead will require changes in climate, environmental stress, or disturbance to alter the competitive balance between these species. However, where competition and herbivory are low, elevated CO2 may accelerate mangrove transition from the seedling to sapling stage and also increase above- and belowground production of existing mangrove stands, particularly in combination with higher soil N.

TI  - Characterization, seasonal occurrence, and diel fluctuation of poly(hydroxyalkanoate) in photosynthetic microbial mats
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) levels and repeating-unit compositions were examined in stratified photosynthetic microbial mats from Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Mass., and Ebro Delta, Spain. Unlike what has been observed in pure cultures of phototrophic bacteria, the prevalence of hydroxyvalerate (HV) repeating units relative to hydroxybutyrate (HB) repeating units was striking. In the cyanobacteria-dominated green material of Sippewissett mats, the mole percent ratio of repeating units was generally 1HB:1HV. In the purple sulfur bacteria-dominated pink material the relationship was typically 1HB:2HV. In Sippewissett mats, PHA contributed about 0.5 to 1% of the organic carbon in the green layer and up to 6% in the pink layer. In Ebro Delta mats, PHA of approximately 1HB:2HV-repeating-unit distribution contributed about 2% of the organic carbon of the composite photosynthetic layers (the green and pink layers were not separated). Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh mats were utilized for more extensive investigation of seasonal, diel, and exogenous carbon effects. When the total PHA content was normalized to organic carbon, there was little seasonal variation in PHA levels. However, routine daily variation was evident at all sites and seasons. In every case, PHA levels increased during the night and decreased during the day. This phenomenon was conspicuous in the pink layer, where PHA levels doubled overnight. The daytime declines could be inhibited by artificial shading. Addition of exogenous acetate, lactate, and propionate induced two- to fivefold increases in the total PHA levels when applied in the daylight but had no effect when applied at night. The distinct diel pattern of in situ PHA accumulation at night appears to be related, in some phototrophs, to routine dark energy metabolism and is not influenced by the availability of organic nutrients.

TI  - Evaluating Tidal Marsh Sustainability in the Face of Sea-Level Rise: A Hybrid Modeling Approach Applied to San Francisco Bay
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - BackgroundTidal marshes will be threatened by increasing rates of sea-level rise (SLR) over the next century. Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities. MethodologyBuilding upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and SLR assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios. Principal FindingsModel results indicated that under a high rate of SLR (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (&#8722;0.2 m MHHW) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on SLR and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats. Conclusions/SignificanceResults suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-SLR scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas. To assist land managers, we developed a web-based decision support tool (www.prbo.org/sfbayslr).

TI  - Accretion of a New England (USA) salt marsh in response to inlet migration, storms, and sea-level rise
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment accumulation rates were determined at several sites throughout Nauset Marsh (Massachusetts, U.S.A.), a back-barrier lagoonal system, using feldspar marker horizons to evaluate short-term rates (1 to 2 year scales) and radiometric techniques to estimate rates over longer time scales (Cs-137, Pb-210, C-14). The barrier spit fronting the Spartina-dominated study site has a complex geomorphic history of inlet migration acid overwash events. This study evaluates sediment accumulation rates in relation to inlet migration, storm events and sea-level rise. The marker horizon technique displayed strong temporal and spatial variability in response to storm events and proximity to the inlet. Sediment accumulation rates of up to 24 mm year(-1) were recorded in the immediate vicinity of the inlet during a period that included several major coastal storms, while feldspar sites remote from the inlet had substantially lower rates (trace accumulation to 2.2 mm year(-1)). During storm-free periods, accumulation rates did not exceed 6.7 mm year(-1), but remained quite variable among sites. Based on Cs-137 (3.8 to 4.5 mm year(-1)) and Pb-210 (2.6 to 4.2 mm year(-1)) radiometric techniques, integrating sediment accumulation over decadal time scales, the marsh appeared to be keeping pace with the relative rate of sea-level rise from 1921 to 1993 of 2.4 mm year(-1) At one site, the Pb-210-based sedimentation rate and rate of relative sea-level rise were nearly similar and pear rhizome analysis revealed that Distichlis spicata recently replaced this once S. patens site, suggesting that this portion of Nauset Marsh may be getting wetter, thus representing an initial response to wetland submergence. Horizon markers are useful in evaluating the role of short-term events, such as storms or inlet migration, influencing marsh sedimentation processes. However, sampling methods that integrate marsh sedimentation over decadal time scales are preferable when evaluating a systems response to sea-level rise. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Deriving spatial and temporal patterns of coastal marsh aggradation from hurricane storm surge marker beds
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses storm surge sediment beds deposited by Hurricanes Audrey (1957), Carla (1961), Rita (2005) and Ike (2008) to investigate spatial and temporal changes in marsh sedimentation on the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge in Southeastern Texas. Fourteen sediment cores were collected along a transect extending 1230 m inland from the Gulf coast. Storm-surge-deposited sediment beds were identified by texture, organic content, carbonate content, the presence of marine microfossils and Cs-137 dating. The hurricane-derived sediment beds facilitate assessment of changes in marsh sedimentation from nearshore to inland locations and over decadal to annual timescales. Spatial variation along the transect reflects varying contributions" from three prevailing sediment sources: flooding, overwash and organic sedimentation from marsh plants. Over about the last decade, hurricane overwash has been the predominant sediment source for nearshore locations because of large sediment inputs from Hurricanes Rita and Ike. Farther inland, hurricane inputs diminish and sedimentation is dominated by deposition from flood waters and a larger organic component. Temporal variations in sedimentation reflect hurricane activity, changes in marsh surface elevation and degree of compaction of marsh sediments, which is time-dependent. There was little to no marsh sedimentation in the period 2008-2014, firstly because no hurricanes impacted the study area and secondly because overwash sedimentation prior to 2008 had increased nearshore marsh surface elevations by up to 0.68 m, reducing subsequent inputs from flooding. Marsh sedimentation rates were relatively high in the period 2005-2008, averaging 2.13 cm/year and possibly reflecting sediment contributions from Hurricanes Humberto and Gustay. However, these marsh sediments are highly organic and largely uncompacted. Older, deeper marsh deposits formed between 1961 and 2005 are less organic rich, more compacted and have an average annual sedimentation rate of 0.38 cm/year, which is closely comparable to long-term sedimentation rates in similar marsh settings nearby. These results demonstrate the utility of using hurricane storm surge marker beds to investigate marsh sedimentation, provide insights into the sedimentary response of coastal marshes to hurricanes and provide useful guidance to public policy aimed at combating the effects of sea-level rise on coastal marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico.

T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiang Plain, the second largest marsh in China, has experienced intensive cultivation over the past 50 years. Most of the marshlands were converted to soybean and rice fields. However, little is known about the effects of tillage on the soil fauna. 9 treatments, including original marshland soil, rice and soybean cultivation with and without fertilizer and herbicide applications, were imitated with 135 buckets under greenhouse conditions. The soil characteristics and Collembola in these treatments were investigated for one plant growth season.The soil environment was deteriorated (as indicated by the decreased soil oxidizable organic matter, total nitrogen and soil water content and increased soil compaction) by soybean and rice cultivation treatments. The densities and species richness of Collembola significantly decreased in the rice cultivation treatments but not in the soybean cultivation treatments. For the soybean cultivation treatments, density and species richness of the soil Collembola significantly increased in the fertilizer, herbicide and fertilizer + herbicide application treatments. It probably caused by increasing root and shoot biomass in these treatments.It is concluded that the tillage treatments in a wetland soil had both qualitative and quantitative adverse effects on the soil collembolans, and these effects might further alter the soil ecological processes.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring Data From Herring River Wetlands Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 2015-Jan2020
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - The Herring River estuary (Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Massachusetts) has been tidally restricted for over a century by a dike constructed near the mouth of the river. Behind the dike, the tidal restriction has caused the conversion of salt marsh wetlands to various other ecosystems including impounded freshwater marshes, flooded shrub land, drained forested upland, and wetlands dominated by Phragmites australis. This estuary is now managed by the National Park Service, which has plans to replace the dike and restore tidal flow to the estuary. To assist National Park Service land managers with restoration planning, study collaborators have been investigating differences in soil properties, carbon accumulation, and greenhouse gas fluxes across differing ecosystems within the Herring River Estuary. The U.S. Geological Survey collected continuous monitoring data (including water level, soil temperature, air temperature, and meteorological parameters). These datasets can help evaluate key ecosystem drivers to make predictions about potential changes as restoration commences.

AB  - Vertical profiles of C, N, delta N-15 and Pb were measured in the Mondego and Mira estuaries as markers that conveyed notions as to the relative influence of anthropogenic influence over the past decades. Recent carbon changes in both estuaries may reflect changes in estuarine productivity, probably as a consequence of sediment reworking and erosion, and also of losses in salt marsh area and dwarf eelgrass beds. delta N-15 values began to diverge considerably before the %C and %N and were higher in Mondego. delta N-15 signatures detected N enrichment at relatively low rates, and indicated that Mondego received more enriched N than Mira. Lead concentrations differed between estuaries, with higher concentrations in Mondego. The secular increase in %N, Pb, and delta N-15 signatures was significantly related to human density in the watersheds of the estuaries and were sensitive indicators of anthropogenic activity.

AB  - To investigate how plant invasion affects sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) responsible for sulfate reduction, we conducted a comparative study of diversity and composition of SRB in rhizosphere soils of invasive exotic species (Spartina alterniflora) and two native species (Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) on Jiuduansha Island located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. Throughout the growing season, profiles of DGGE fingerprints of SRB had distinct variations in relation to phenological stages of these three plant species. The higher richness and abundance of SRB in the rhizospheres of native plants mainly occurred when the plants were in vegetative growth and reproductive stages. However, the higher richness and abundance of SRB also occurred in the late growing season (senescent stage) of S. alterniflora rhizosphere, during which Desulfobuibus, Desulfuromonas, Desulfovibrio, and Firmicutes were dominant. Our results adding to our previous studies suggested that abundant SRB in late stage might have close relationships with decomposition of soil organic matters produced by S. alterniflora.

TI  - Leaf fatty acid remodeling in the salt-excreting halophytic grass Spartina patens along a salinity gradient
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina patens is a highly dispersed halophytic grass invader in Mediterranean marshes. It is also characterized by having a high degree of resistance to salinity, one of the main drivers of plant zonation in salt marshes. Nevertheless, the physiological basis behind the extreme resistance of S. patens requires more detailed studies. In the present work, we aimed to study how membrane fatty acid remodeling could contribute to the resistance of this plant to salt. Spartina patens individuals exposed to increasing levels of salinity and its leaf fatty acid profile under lipid peroxidation products evaluated under all tested concentrations. A significant increase in the relative amounts of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) was observed, namely palmitic acid (C16:0), essential for PS II functioning, and stearic (C18:0) acid. The chloroplastidial trans-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1t) as well as the polyunsaturated linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids showed significant decreases in all the salt treatments. These changes led to a reduction in the double bond index in salt-treated plants which reflects reduction of the fluidity of the chloroplast membranes, which could contribute to maintain the membrane impermeable to the toxic exogenous Na. Despite the decrease observed in the total fatty acid contents in plants exposed to high salt concentrations the amounts of lipid peroxidation products decreased highlighting the resistance of this species towards toxic exogenous salt concentrations. Membrane fatty acid remodeling could represent an efficient mechanism to maintain the photosynthetic machinery of S. patens highly efficient under salt stress.

TI  - The effects of relic fauna on initial patch colonisation in a British saltmarsh
T2  - Netherlands Journal of Aquatic Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - When a disturbance impacts an area it rarely leads to a complete defaunation, some individuals survive forming a 'relic fauna'. Relic fauna in azoic patches in an intertidal soft-bottom habitat were simulated by the separate introduction of individuals of Nereis diversicolor, Hydrobia ulvae and Littorina littorea into defaunated cores. These were exposed in the field for 24 hours and the effects of relies on colonization were assessed separately for colonization via the sediment surface and colonization via the surface and laterally through the sediment. After 24 hours all the species in the ambient community were recorded from at least some experimental cores. Densities of the most abundant infaunal taxa, Corophium volutator, Enchytraeus buchholzi, Manayunkia aestuarina, Tubificoides benedeni and nematodes, varied between 1% and 279% of ambient. MDS ordinations showed significant differences in the fauna of experimental cores, a result of the lack of full colonization by some species and the presence of other species at densities in excess of ambient. Comparisons (ANOSIM and ANOVA) of the fauna of the relic addition cores vs. no-addition cores showed an influence of N. diversicolor on colonization. However, this relic effect appeared to be masked by the high degree of variation in colonization. Densities of L. littorina and H. ulvae were not maintained in all of the experimental cores and there was no significant difference in the fauna of cores in which the treatments were maintained. It therefore seems that initial colonization of patches in the emergent saltmarsh is controlled by the (i) supply of colonists and (ii) attraction to under-exploited organic matter and that any relic fauna exerts little influence on the early stages of the colonization process.

TI  - Heavy metal contamination assessment of surface sediments of the Subei Shoal, China: Spatial distribution, source apportionment and ecological risk
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated heavy metals (Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg) concentrations in surface sediment of Subei Shoal, China, to illustrate their spatial distribution characteristics, sources and potential ecological risk of pollution. Contents of total organic carbon (TOC), clay, silt and sand were 1.7 +/- 0.8%, 33 +/- 3.2%, 13.6 +/- 14.2% and 83.1 +/- 17.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of TOC, clay and silt were similar; however, distribution of Hg was inverse. Concentrations of Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg were 47.88 +/- 8.93, 38.18 +/- 8.86, 19.22 +/- 5.14, 11.32 +/- 5.07, 6.97 +/- 2.45, 0.13 +/- 0.72, 0.56 +/- 0.77 and 0.06 +/- 0.02 mg kg(-1) sediment, respectively. Principal component analysis suggested that Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni were mainly derived from natural sources, whereas Pb, Cd, As and Hg from industrial and agricultural sources. Results of geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index (RI), pollution load index (PLI), toxic risk index (TRI) and contamination severity index (CSI) demonstrated that pollution levels of Cd and Hg were moderate, which should attract more attention as main pollution factors. The pollution was mainly distributed in the central and northern parts, and the southern part had a good ecological environment. Moreover, the contaminated stations accounted respective for 33.4%, 25.9%, 333% and 70.4% of RI, PLI, TRI and CSI, of which 70.4% of the contamination severity index stations contained 66.7% of much lower severity stations. These findings could contribute to more effective exploitation of tidal flat resources, and the prevention and treatment of tidal marsh environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil Structure and Its Relationship to Shallow Soil Subsidence in Coastal Wetlands
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerating sea-level rise poses a threat to mangroves and salt marshes. Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground root production is proposed to increase soil elevation enabling these intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level. However, shallow soil subsidence is frequently observed, which may cancel out or even outweigh the positive effects of surface accretion and root production on soil elevation gains. The processes that lead to shallow soil subsidence have not often been investigated. Here, we used computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the volume of coarse pores in the top 20 cm of 30-cm-deep soil cores collected from mangroves and salt marshes within Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. The four field sites have long-term observations of variation in soil surface elevation gain, surface accretion rate, and shallow subsidence rate using the rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method. Over our sites, we found that the rates of shallow soil subsidence were positively related to the volume of soil coarse pores and soil clay and silt content rather than to the volume of fine pores or total porosity or other soil properties. In turn, the volume of soil coarse pores was positively related to the volume of animal burrows and root mass. Fine-pore volume and total porosity of soils were negatively associated with soil bulk density, which was in turn negatively related to soil organic matter content. Our results indicate influences of differently sized soil pores in shallow soil subsidence and suggest that animal burrowing may play a role in shallow soil subsidence.

TI  - Stability in natural bacterial communities: II. Plant resource allocation effects on rhizosphere diazotroph assemblage composition
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant rhizospheres are dynamic environments in which microbes compete for resources, particularly plant-derived organic carbon/energy sources. Altering plant productivity changes the availability of carbon/energy resources to rhizosphere microbiota. This limitation is expected to intensify competition for the remaining carbon supply and could cause the loss of poor competitors from the assemblage. We clipped or shaded plots of the salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, to shift plant carbon resource allocation from the rhizosphere to the aboveground shoots. We then examined key porewater parameters (pH, salinity, H2S, NH4+), diazotrophic activity (by acetylene reduction assay), and diazotroph assemblage composition after 2 weeks or 8 weeks of treatment. The diazotroph assemblage composition was monitored via the polymerase chain reaction using nifH specific primers followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Porewater parameters and acetylene reduction rates did not differ significantly among treatments. The DGGE profiles also were very similar across the control and experimental treatments, indicating that no detectable diazotroph species were displaced from the assemblage. This implies that rhizosphere diazotrophs are able to compete successfully against nondiazotrophs, in spite of the high energy requirements of nitrogen fixation. These results show that the species composition of the diazotroph assemblage in the S. alterniflora rhizosphere is stable in the face of short-duration but potentially high-impact variations in carbon resource availability.

TI  - Microtopographical modification by a herbivore facilitates the growth of a coastal saltmarsh plant
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing evidence shows that herbivores can facilitate plant growth and maintain the resistance of plant communities to trophic consumption in a variety of ecosystems. However, the positive effects of herbivores on annual saltmarsh plants in coastal ecosystems are relatively understudied. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore whether and how microtopographical modification by the herbivorous crab Helice tientsinensis stimulates the growth of the saltmarsh plant Suaeda salsa. Results showed that, despite grazing on S. salsa, H. tientsinensis can promote density, total biomass, average plant height, average root length, and average biomass through burrowing-generated concave-convex microtopography, which can improve the edaphic environment (decreased soil hardness and salinity, and increased soil moisture content, oxidation-reduction potential, and carbon and nitrogen content), and provide plants more clustered growth opportunities that could facilitate positive intraspecific plant interactions. This study can provide scientific guidance for ecosystem restoration in coastal intertidal saltmarshes.

TI  - Effect of straw decomposition on organic carbon fractions and aggregate stability in salt marshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Straw addition can increase the content of soil organic carbon (SOC), and affect the content of aggregates and organic carbon fractions. The changes in aggregates and organic carbon fractions in the natural salt marsh, 10-year and 15-year freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary were studied by 120-day field in situ culture experiments with Phragmites australis straw addition. The results showed that straw addition mainly enhanced the soil aggregate stability in the 10-year freshwater pumping area, and the organic carbon content of small macro-aggregates increased significantly by 26.36% (P < 0.05). In particular, the content of coarse particulate organic carbon (cPOC) with small macro-aggregates in all areas increased significantly with the addition of straw (P < 0.05). For small macro-aggregates in the 10-year pumping area, the cPOC contents increased significantly by 21.73 g/kg (P < 0.05); and were significantly higher than the fine particulate organic carbon (fPOC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (mSOC) contents, as the fPOC contents in micro-aggregates increased by 85.92% (P < 0.05). Additionally, the cPOC contents of small macro-aggregates and fPOC contents of micro aggregates increased by 34.59% and 43.24% in the 15-year pumping area. The contents of mSOC were the lowest in different aggregates across all areas. Thus, straw addition had a significant effect on the contents of cPOC and fPOC, while freshwater pumping in the YRE could affect the distribution of fPOC and mSOC with aggregates.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Twenty-five years of ecosystem development of constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland creation and restoration are frequently used to replace ecological functions and values lost when natural wetlands are degraded or destroyed. On many sites, restoration of ecological attributes such as secondary production, habitat/species diversity, and wetland soil characteristics do not occur within the first decade, and no long-term studies exist to document the length of time required to achieve complete restoration of wetland dependent functions and values. Characteristics of community structure (macrophyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15-25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12-24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7-12 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) than in natural marshes (2-5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems. Different ecological attributes develop at different rates, with primary producers achieving equivalence during the first 5 yr, followed by the benthic infauna community 5-10 yr later. Accumulation of soil nutrients to levels similar to those of reference marshes may require more time.

TI  - Long-term Variability in Inorganic Sediment Contributions to the Great Marsh, Massachusetts
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In New England, the marsh platform sits above mean high water and is flooded about 8 times a month. This high marsh, dominated by Spartina patens, has a vertical accretion rate of similar to 2.5 mm/yr, significantly lower than the 6-7 mm/yr accretion rate of low marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Accelerating sea-level rise will eventually cause the high marsh to transition to low marsh; the rate of this change is controlled, in part, by the contribution of inorganic sediment. Temporal and spatial variability of inorganic marsh sedimentation during the past similar to 2.5 ka was examined at the Great Marsh, Massachusetts, using twenty cores, each similar to 180cm long, along five transects. Transects were aligned perpendicular to bays and major channels at different compass quadrants to assess influences of wind and tidal flow during storms. Cores were sampled every 20 cm to determine percent organic matter (loss on ignition) and grain size distribution (using a laser particle size analyzer). Data show a weak correlation for grain size versus distance from the nearest channel or bay. Additionally, no consistent vertical trends in grain size were observed, either within individual sampling sites nor among coring transects. Instead, we find coarsening upwards trends at some sites, likely due to increased channelization and tidal velocity as the marsh matured. Elsewhere, sediments fine upwards in response to deepening bays and channels. Finally, transects exhibiting variable grain size trends are likely influenced by ice rafted sediment. These results demonstrate the complexity of sedimentation on the marsh platform and the challenge in accurately predicting patterns of sediment transport using a single suspended grain size in hydrodynamic models in these systems.

TI  - Carbon stable isotopes as indicators of coastal eutrophication
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecologists and managers have frequently used nitrogen stable isotopes (N-15) to trace and monitor sources of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) in coastal ecosystems. However, the interpretation of N-15 data can often be challenging, as the isotope values fractionate substantially due to preferential retention and uptake by biota. There is a growing body of evidence that carbon isotopes may be a useful alternative indicator for eutrophication, as they may be sensitive to changes in primary production that result from anthropogenic nutrient inputs. We provide three examples of systems where C-13 values sensitively track phytoplankton production. First, earlier (1980s) mesocosm work established positive relationships between C-13 and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved silica concentrations. Consistent with these findings, a contemporary mesocosm experiment designed to replicate a temperate intertidal salt marsh environment also demonstrated that the system receiving supplementary nutrient additions had higher nutrient concentrations, higher chlorophyll concentrations, and higher C-13 values. This trend was particularly pronounced during the growing season, with differences less evident during senescence. And finally, these results were replicated in the open waters of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, during a spring phytoplankton bloom. These three examples, taken together with the pre-existing body of literature, suggest that, at least in autotrophic, phytoplankton-dominated systems, C-13 values can be a useful and sensitive indicator of eutrophication.

M3  - Article
AB  - We studied relationships among sediment variables (carbon content, C:N, hardness, oxygen penetration, silt-clay fraction), hydrologic variables (dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, transparency, water depth), sizes and biomass of common invertebrate classes, and densities of 15 common waterbird species in ponds of impounded freshwater, oligohaline, mesohaline, and unimpounded mesohaline marshes during winters 1997-98 to 1999-2000 on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, USA. Canonical correspondence analysis and forward selection was used to analyze the above variables. Water depth and oxygen penetration were the variables that best segregated habitat characteristics that resulted in maximum densities of common waterbird species. Most common waterbird species were associated with specific marsh types, except Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeala). We concluded that hydrologic manipulation of marsh ponds is the best way to manage habitats for these birds, if the hydrology can be controlled adequately.

TI  - Procedure to use phosphogypsum industrial waste for mineral CO2 sequestration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial wet phosphoric acid production in Huelva (SW Spain) has led to the controversial stockpiling of waste phosphogypsum by-products, resulting in the release of significant quantities of toxic impurities in salt marshes in the Tinto river estuary. In the framework of the fight against global climate change and the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a simple and efficient procedure for CO2 mineral sequestration is presented in this work, using phosphogypsum waste as a calcium source. Our results demonstrate the high efficiency of portlandite precipitation by phosphogypsum dissolution using an alkaline soda solution. Carbonation experiments performed at ambient pressure and temperature resulted in total conversion of the portlandite into carbonate. The fate of trace elements present in the phosphogypsum waste was also investigated, and trace impurities were found to be completely transferred to the final calcite. We believe that the procedure proposed here should be considered not only as a solution for reducing old stockpiles of phosphogypsum wastes, but also for future phosphoric acid and other gypsum-producing industrial processes, resulting in more sustainable production.

TI  - Phosphorus retention in calcareous soils and the effect of organic matter on its mobility
T2  - GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A survey of the interactions between phosphorus ( P) species and the components of calcareous soils shows that both surface reactions and precipitation take place, especially in the presence of calcite and limestone. The principal products of these reactions are dicalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate, which may interconvert after formation. The role of calcium carbonate in P retention by calcareous soils is, however, significant only at relatively high P concentrations non-carbonate clays play a more important part at lower concentrations. In the presence of iron oxide particles, occlusion of P frequently occurs in these bodies, especially with forms of the element that are pedogenic in origin. Progressive mineralization and immobilization, often biological in nature, are generally observed when P is added as a fertilizer.Manure serves both as a source of subsurface P and an effective mobilizing agent. Blockage of P sorption sites by organic acids, as well as complexation of exchangeable Al and Fe in the soil, are potential causes of this mobilization. Swine and chicken manure are especially rich P sources, largely due the practice of adding the element to the feed of nonruminants. Humic materials, both native and added, appear to increase recovery of Olsen P. In the presence of metal cations, strong complexes between inorganic P and humates are formed. The influence of humic soil amendments on P mobility warrants further investigation.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of phytoplankton community pigment composition in two salt marsh estuaries in southeastern United States
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton community pigment composition and water quality were measured seasonally along salinity gradients in two minimally urbanized salt marsh estuaries in South Carolina in order to examine their spatial and temporal distributions. The North Inlet estuary has a relatively small watershed with minimal fresh water input, while the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto (ACE) Basin is characterized by a relatively greater influence of riverine drainage. Sampling stations were located in regions of the estuaries experiencing frequent diurnal tidal mixing and had similar salinity and temperature regimens. Phytoplankton community pigment composition was assessed by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and multivariate statistical analyses. Shannon diversity index, principal-component, and cluster analyses revealed that phytoplankton community pigments in both estuaries were seasonally variable, with similar diversities but different compositions. The temporal pigment patterns indicated that there was a relatively weak correlation between the pigments in ACE Basin and the relative persistence of photopigment groups in North Inlet. The differences were presumably a consequence of the unpredictability and relatively greater influence of river discharge in the ACE Basin, in contrast to the greater environmental predictability of the more tidally influenced North Inlet. Furthermore, the timing, magnitude, and pigment composition of the annual phytoplankton bloom were different in the two estuaries. The bloom properties in North Inlet reflected the predominance of autochthonous ecological control (e.g., regenerated nutrients, grazing), and those in ACE Basin suggested that there was greater influence of allochthonous environmental factors (e.g., nutrient loading, changes in turbidity). These interestuarine differences in phytoplankton community structure and control provide insight into the organization of phytoplankton in estuaries.

TI  - Identifying marsh dieback events from Landsat image series (1998-2018) with an Autoencoder in the NIWB estuary, South Carolina
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports an inventory of marsh dieback events from spatial and temporal perspectives in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay (NIWB) estuary, South Carolina (SC). Past studies in the Gulf/Atlantic coast states have reported acute marsh dieback events in which marsh rapidly browned and thinned, leaving stubble of dead stems or mudflat with damaged ecosystem services. Reported marsh dieback in SC, however, have been limited. This study identified all marsh dieback events in the estuary since 1998. With 20 annually collected Landsat images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series was extracted. A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder neural network was developed to identify the NDVI anomalies on the trajectories. All marsh dieback patches were extracted, and their inter-annual changes were examined. Results showed a continuous, spatially variable multi-year dieback event in 1998-2005, which aligned with the reported dieback in the early 2000s from other states. The identified patches mostly returned to normal within one year while the phenomenon reoccurred in other areas of the estuary during the prolonged dieback period. This study presents the first attempt to explore long-term dieback dynamics in an estuary using satellite time series. It provides valuable information in documenting marsh healthiness and environmental resilience on SC coasts.

AB  - This chapter gives an overview of redox processes occurring within surface waters, sediments, and sediment pore waters of estuaries. Attention is given to parameters inducing stratification and redox zonation, as well as related differences between river deltas and fjords. Factors affecting metal speciation, mobility, and availability in oxic estuarine environments are discussed, followed by the role of redox processes when the estuarine environment evolves toward anoxic conditions. Thereafter, focus is on the fate of metals as affected by occasional oxidation of reduced environments. Physicochemical extraction methods that are helpful to assess risks related to the presence of metals in estuarine floodplain soils and sediments are discussed.

TI  - The importance of estuarine-derived carbon for the nearshore marine environment: studies on two contrasting South African estuaries
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The food web structure within and adjacent to two permanently open estuaries with contrasting flow regimes along the south-eastern coast of South Africa was investigated employing stable isotope analysis. The Kariega Estuary is considered a freshwater-deprived system, while the Great Fish Estuary is freshwater-dominated due to an interbasin transfer scheme. Results from a study undertaken in April 2005 indicate that in the Kariega Estuary carbon sources assimilated by the zooplankton are derived from riparian vegetation in the upper reaches and from salt marsh and submerged macrophytes in the lower reaches of the system. In contrast, within the freshwater-dominated Great Fish Estuary the zooplankton appear to be sustained largely by allochthonous phytoplankton derived from freshwater inflow due to the interbasin transfer scheme. The magnitude of outflow of fresh water appears to play an important role as a carbon source for copepods and filter feeders in the marine environment adjacent to the Great Fish Estuary. The export of estuarine-derived particulate organic matter (POM) was evident up to 12 km downstream (west) of the Great Fish Estuary. Conversely, estuarine-derived POM appears to be utilised only directly adjacent to the Kariega Estuary mouth.

TI  - Characterization of bacterial community structure and diversity in rhizosphere soils of three plants in rapidly changing salt marshes using 16S rDNA
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and diversity of the bacterial communities in rhizosphere soils of native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter and alien Spartina alterniflora in the Yangtze River Estuary were investigated by constructing 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries. The bacterial diversity was quantified by placing the clones into operational taxonomic unit (OTU) groups at the level of sequence similarity of > 97%. Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting 398 clone sequences indicated a high diversity of bacteria in the rhizosphere soils of these plants. The members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria of the phylum Proteobacteria were the most abundant in rhizobacteria. Chao I nonparametric diversity estimator coupled with the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) was applied to sequence data obtained from each library to evaluate total sequence diversity and quantitatively compare the level of dominance. The results showed that Phragmites, Scirpus, and Spartina rhizosphere soils contained 200, 668, and 382 OTUs, respectively. The bacterial communities in the Spartina and Phragmites rhizosphere soils displayed species dominance revealed by 1/D, whereas the bacterial community in Scirpus rhizosphere soil had uniform distributions of species abundance. Overall, analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries from the rhizosphere soils indicates that the changes in bacterial composition may occur concomitantly with the shift of species composition in plant communities.

TI  - Recent advancement on estimation of blue carbon biomass using satellite-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - History revealed that people had been discharging a large proportion of carbon into the atmosphere through fossil fuel consumption and the marine environment. These have prompted atmospheric carbon fixations that have proved to be larger than at any other point throughout the human survival. Due to the critical role of blue carbon in the ocean carbon cycle, it is essential to pay extra attention to these habitats (mangrove, seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and coral reefs). Hence, this article reviews the recent developments in blue carbon biomass estimation using a geospatial approach and highlighted the blue carbon components achievements and gaps. Biomass and soil carbon estimation, using change detection analysis, were reviewed. Analysis of the carbon conversion factors, used in converting biomass to carbon, was demonstrated. The review shall act as support for the realization of the target 14.2 and 14.5 of the 14(th) sustainable development goal established by the United Nations, to fast track the achievement of the 2020 agenda.

TI  - Developmental progression of photosystem II electron transport and CO2 uptake in Spartina alterniflora, a facultative halophyte, in a northern salt marsh
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaves of Spartina alterniflora Loisel, a halophytic salt marsh grass, show rapid changes in photosynthetic performance and allocation of carbon and nitrogen resources to key macromolecules during the growing season. Photo system II (PSII) electron transport correlated primarily with the developmental state of the plants and less with the ambient temperature. The ratio of gross CO2 uptake to PSII electron transport showed high interleaf variation but rose steeply to about 0.22 mol CO2.mol PSII electrons(-1) through June to late July, with subsequent decline. Seasonal variation in CO2 per PSII electrons correlated with the pattern of maximum capacity for CO2 uptake. RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) and chlorophyll (Chl) (mumol.m(-2)) peaked in early June, before the period of maximum leaf elongation. RuBisCO then declined through net dilution as the leaves elongated to maximal length in mid-July. RuBisCO and Chl levels stabilized once leaf elongation stopped in mid-July, but from mid-August onward the leaves showed net loss of RuBisCO and Chl. The plants thus show a developmental program of early remobili zation of nitrogenous macromolecules from leaves even though the plants thereby forego maximal photo synthetic performance during 75 d in late summer and early autumn, when temperature and light are near optimal.

TI  - Quantifying the Benefits of Estuarine Habitat Restoration in the Gulf of Mexico: an Introduction to the Theme Section
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This collection of papers provides insights into methods and data currently available to quantify the benefits associated with estuarine habitat restoration projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA, with potential applicability to other coastal systems. Extensive habitat restoration is expected to occur in the northern Gulf of Mexico region over the next several decades through funding associated with the 2010Deepwater Horizonoil spill. Papers in this section examine the development of vegetation, soil properties, invertebrate fauna, and nekton communities in restored coastal marshes and provide a conceptual framework for applying these findings to quantify the benefits associated with compensatory marsh restoration. Extensive meta-analysis of existing data for Gulf of Mexico coastal habitats further confirms that structured habitats such as marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, and oyster reefs support greater nekton densities than nonvegetated bottom habitat, with oyster reefs supporting different species assemblages than marsh and submerged aquatic vegetation. Other papers demonstrate that while vegetation cover can establish rapidly within the first 5 years of restoration, belowground parameters such as root biomass and soil organic matter remain 44% to 92% lower at restored marshes than reference marshes 15 years after restoration. On average, amphipod and nekton densities are also not fully restored until at least 20 and 13 years following restoration, respectively. Additional papers present methods to estimate the benefits associated with marsh restoration projects, nekton productivity associated with coastal and estuarine habitats, and the benefits associated with the removal of derelict crab traps in Gulf of Mexico estuaries.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Technologies which utilize semiochemicals, traps/targets and mass trapping are relatively new for management of adult mosquito populations. To date most of the emphasis has been on developing barriers of attractant-baited and insecticide-impregnated targets. The most successful continuous use of this type of technology has been at Stevens' Landing, Collier County, FL. Recently, commercially available traps have been evaluated for their ability to reduce nuisance populations of mosquitoes. Use of Mosquito Magnet (TM) Pro traps along a nature trail on an isolated island (Atsena Otie) in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a significant reduction in annoyance caused by the black salt marsh mosquito Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann). This chapter presents a brief discussion of semiochemicals (behavior modifying) and mosquito traps, strategies for using them for insect control, and an overview of the recent advancements in research activities conducted to evaluate using combinations of serniochemicals and mass trapping techniques for adult mosquito management.

TI  - Halophyte Plant Communities Affecting Enzyme Activity and Microbes in Saline Soils of the Yellow River Delta in China
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta covers a large area of saline soil, which needs to be recovered urgently. As the main local halophytes Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Tamarix chinensis communities play an important role in the improvement of the soil microenvironment. Therefore, we investigated the effect of these three salt-tolerant plant communities on soil enzyme activity in the Yellow River Delta in China. Halophyte plant communities influence the soil micro-ecosystem in the wetland by exerting effects on the physicochemical properties of the soil, and on enzymes andmicrobial community. In the soil these enzymes affect the redox potential (catalase) and cycling of carbon (dehydrogenase), nitrogen (protease, urease), and phosphorus (acid phosphatase). We analyzed enzyme activity and the relations between the activity of different enzymes, the physicochemical properties of the soil, and the microbial composition. The activity of five enzymes differed significantly between the plant communities. Soil salinity and microbial community composition all influenced enzyme activity. Catalase, protease and urease activity in the soil of the T. chinensis community was significantly higher than in the other two plant communities. Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity were significantly higher in the soil of the P. australis community than in the other two communities. In the succession of the plant community from herbs to woody plants with different salt tolerance mechanisms, a large aboveground biomassmay support the growth of soil enzyme activity and soilmicroorganism diversity. This study showed that the belowground processes were strongly related with plant community succession in salt marsh ecosystem.

TI  - Spartina patens Productivity and Soil Organic Matter Response to Sedimentation and Nutrient Enrichment
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many coastal wetlands are subject to the combined effects of reduced sediment input and increased nutrient loads from watersheds. Restoration strategies focused on increasing marsh elevation and acreage can involve adding sediment through dredge sediment deposition or diversion of river water. It is unclear, however, how sediment inputs influence plant productivity in areas also receiving high nutrient loads. We tested the hypothesis that productivity of Spartina patens is greater with both nutrient and sediment addition than either or neither in a greenhouse experiment. Soil organic matter and nitrogen concentrations were predicted to increase with nutrient addition, but decrease with sediment addition. Plants experienced one of two levels of sediment deposition (control and 4 applications of 2cm river silt) within either nutrient-enriched (6.96 N, 1.82 P, 1.82Kmg/L) or control tanks. Spartina patens exhibited nearly double the height, stem density, and aboveground biomass in nutrient treatments as compared to controls. Belowground biomass was also stimulated by nutrient-enrichment. Sedimentation reduced the emergence of new stems, but increased fine root biomass. Nutrient enrichment further stimulated root and rhizome growth into added surface sediment. Despite a large plant response to added nutrients, soil properties were unaffected by nutrient-enrichment.

AB  - The diked and freshened Herring River estuary (Wellfleet, Massachusetts) experiences regular summer hypoxia and one- to three-week periods of main stream anoxia, often accompanied by fish kills.  Stream hypoxia results from the temperature-dependent increase in oxygen demand of organic matter released by diked salt marsh deposits; periods of total anoxia are induced by heavy rains which increase the runoff of wetland organic matter.  Historic reductions in tidal flushing have extended the low salinity region of the estuary normally characterized by high organic loads and minimal flushing.  Recurrent main stream anoxia has depressed both migratory and resident aquatic fauna.

TI  - National inventories of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks: The UK experience
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

TI  - Petroleum biomarkers as tracers of low-level chronic oil contamination of coastal environments: A systematic approach in a subtropical mangrove
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Petroleum biomarkers (hopanes, terpanes and steranes) are frequently assessed in estuarine sediments as tracers of oil input. In order to compare distinct patterns of hydrocarbon accumulation in mudflats, salt marsh and mangrove, sediments from two transects (control and impacted areas) were sampled in Paranagua Bay, SW Atlantic. Concentrations of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and petroleum biomarkers (hopanes, terpanes and steranes) were determined, as well as bulk parameters (TOC, grain size and delta C-13). N-alkanes concentrations were similar between control and impacted sites (respectively, 3.03 +/- 1.20 mu g g(-1) and 4.11 +/- 3.02 mu g g(-1) ) and reflected a high biogenic input. Conversely, PAHs and petroleum biomarker concentrations were three to six times higher in impacted site than the control site (respectively, 60.4 +/- 23.3 ng g(-1) and 22.0 +/- 25.0 ng g(-1) for PAHs and 197.7 +/- 51.8 ng g(-1) and 40.2 +/- 32. ng g(-1), for hopanes). Despite these differences, concentrations were lower than those reported for highly impacted areas worldwide. Diagnostic ratios and hydrocarbon parameters (e.g. total PAHs and total petroleum biomarkers) helped to distinguish human impact in the ecological zones, suggesting different sources and/or levels of weathering, confirmed by ANOVA tests. TOC played a fundamental role to the concentration of hydrocarbons, showing similar distributions along the transects. Petroleum biomarkers could clearly indicate the preferential sites of deposition and assign different levels of anthropic contamination by hydrocarbons, thus providing clear information about the chronic petroleum pollution in coastal sediments.

TI  - Drying effects on decomposition of salt marsh sediment and on lysine sorption
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sorption of organic compounds by coastal marine sediments is strongly affected by dry-wet cycling. In this Study, we determined how drying (and rewetting) sediment affected the decomposition rate of organic matter under both oxic and anoxic conditions, and how sorption changed with decomposition. Organic matter decomposition showed distinct patterns in dried, rewetted sediments compared to those that had never been dried, based on a comparison of ammonium production rates, OC/N ratios and total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) loss rates. Net ammonium production rates were 29 (oxic) and 44 mu M/d (anoxic) in dried, rewetted sediment and 4 (oxic) and 13 mu M/d (anoxic) in wet, never-dried sediment, indicating that a fraction of labile organic compounds like protein, was preferentially decomposed after a dry-wet cycle. The input of fresh organic matter from benthic fauna and microbes killed by the drying process may partially explain the faster remineralization rates in rewetted sediment. The decomposed organic matter in dried sediment might also come from resynthesized microbial biomass or its related byproducts, with low C/N ratios. Based oil comparisons between wet and dried sediments, we hypothesize that sedimentary organic matter (SOM) call assemble into 3D structures that play a significant role in the remineralization pathways of SOM. Drying not only changes the lability of salt marsh SOM, either through exposed proteinaceous matter or resynthesized matter by microbes, but also its sorption capacity. Lysine sorption was used as a probe to test the structural changes of sediment during the incubation. Lysine sorption in both wet and dried sediment remained relatively constant when sediments were incubated under anoxic conditions, although there was much stronger sorption in continuously wet sediment than in dried-rewetted sediment. Under oxic conditions, lysine sorption ill both dried and wet sediment decreased dramatically after a one-month incubation, and the pH in these samples also decreased accordingly, suggesting that Sulfide or ammonium might be oxidized to strong acids (H2SO4 and HNO3) that decrease lysine sorption. Overall, the structure of dried sediment did not appear to be reconstituted after 3-months of laboratory incubation.

TI  - EFFECTS OF HYDROLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT ON SOIL AND MICROBIAL PROPERTIES IN LIJIANG RIPARIAN ZONES OF CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Clarifying the effects of hydrological environmental gradient on soil physicochemical and microbial properties in riparian zone can be helpful for understanding the characteristics of soil ecosystem in the riparian zone, so as to provide a scientific suggestion for the ecological protection and restoration of the riparian zone. Therefore, we measured four types of indices (soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, microbial number and bacterial diversity) for 120 soil samples which had been taken from 4 hydrologic environmental gradients in 10 typical study sites in Lijiang watershed, and analyzed the correlation between the indices and their change trend along the hydrological environment. The results showed that there were a strong coupling and mutual exclusion among different types of characteristic indices of soil in the Lijiang riparian zones; Soil bacterial diversity (phylogenetic diversity, operational taxonomic units, Chao1) was positively correlated with soil pH and negatively correlated with soil organic matter and catalase; Bacteria and actinomycetes number had a positive correlation with available nitrogen, acid phosphatase and sucrase. There were also significant differences in soil physicochemical properties and microbial community structure under different hydrological environments, featuring with the characteristic of gradual change. With decrease of inundation frequency, the bacterial diversity (operational taxonomic units, phylogenetic diversity) decreased gradually, and the soil organic matter, available nitrogen, fungi number and the catalase activity increased gradually; the soil pH value, number of bacteria and actinomycetes, invertase and acid phosphatase activities increased first and then decreased. The research emphasized to maintain the integrity of the hydrological environment gradient and adapt to the gradually changing structure of riparian soil ecosystem, which are the factors to be considered fully during the ecological restoration of the Lijiang riparian zone.

TI  - Halocarbon Emissions from a Degraded Forested Wetland in Coastal South Carolina Impacted by Sea Level Rise
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical- and subtropical-storm surges combined with sea level rise cause saltwater intrusions into low-lying coastal ecosystems along the southeastern coast of the United States, gradually converting freshwater forested wetland into saltmarsh. The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems becomes a degraded forested wetland, where the combination of high levels of soil organic matter and elevated concentrations of halide ions creates a dynamic biogeochemical environment that may be a potential hotspot for halocarbon formation such as chloroform, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide. This study conducted field measurements at a transition zone in coastal South Carolina to quantify halocarbon exchange rates and laboratory soil incubations to determine the contributions of biotic versus abiotic processes. The degraded forested wetland showed significant chloroform emission rates (146 +/- 129 nmol m(-2) d(-1)). The degraded forested wetland remained a net sink for methyl chloride and a negligible source/sink for methyl bromide, unlike the saltmarsh which was a significant source for both. The laboratory incubations strongly suggest that methyl halide consumption in soils at the field site was biotic and that production of methyl halides and chloroform was largely abiotic and temperature-dependent, although additional experiments are required to rule out possible biotic production involving heat-resistant microbes. The results suggest that sea level rise and more frequent storm surges derived from global climate change, in the long term, may increase emissions of chloroform from coastal degraded forested wetlands and of methyl halides if salt marshes expand, with potential impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion.

TI  - Modeling soil parameters using hyperspectral image reflectance in subtropical coastal wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

TI  - THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND TRACE-METALS DISTRIBUTION OF MANGROVE RHIZOSPHERES
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils and porewater of the rhizosphere of mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leech., of the salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel, and of unvegetated mud flats, were analyzed for pH, salinity, platinum electrode redox potential, organic matter content, sulfide concentrations, and the total and exchangeable concentrations of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd). The study was conducted in a fringe mangrove forest in Sepetiba Bay, Rio de janeiro, Brazil. The rhizospheres differed in their biogeochemistry. Mud flats and Rhizophora soils were very reducing, with highest concentrations of sulfide. Avicennia soils showed the highest variability of the variables measured, with the rhizosphere changing from oxic to anoxic conditions. Spartina soils, on the other hand, were generally oxic, with very low sulfide concentration.The distribution of trace metals in these soils varied with the major physical and chemical characteristics. Mud flat soils presented the highest total trace metal concentrations followed by mangrove soils and Spartina soils. However, exchangeable trace metals were similar among the different soils with the exception of Avicennia soils, which due to their characteristic instability of redox conditions, presented much higher exchangeable trace metals concentrations.

T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The original ferrozine method has been modified to sequentially determine the Fe(II)/Fe(III) speciation in small volumes of fresh and marine water samples, at the submicromolar level. Spectrophotometric analyses of the Fe(II)ferrozine complex are performed on a single aliquot before and after a reduction step with hydroxylamine. The procedure is calibrated using Fe(III) standards stable under normal conditions of analysis. It is shown also that the presence of high concentrations of dissolved NOM (natural organic matter) do not create any significant artifacts. The method was used to measure Fe(II) and Fe(III) depth distribution in salt marsh pore waters and in a stratified marine basin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Elemental and stable isotope composition of Zostera noltii (Horneman) leaves during the early phases of decay in a temperate mesotidal lagoon
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the elemental and stable isotope composition of Zostera noltii leaves during the early phases of decay. The litter biomass, the C, N and S elemental contents, the C:N ratios and the delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 values were monitored in a litterbag experiment for 60 days at Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal in two different field conditions, permanently submerged in a salt marsh pond and at high intertidal. The elemental and stable isotope composition of both attached leaves and leaf wrack of Z. noltii was also determined. The overall decay rate of Z. noltii leaf material throughout the whole experimental period was k = 0.016 +/- 0.001 d(-1). Even though the biomass loss of the Z. noltii leaves after 30 days was about 25% higher within the pond than at the high intertidal, at the end of the experiment there were no significant differences between sites. The decay of the C and N content was of the same magnitude and thus the C:N molar ratio did not vary significantly in the experiment. The elemental content of the leaf wrack was in the range of the element content of leaf litter after 30-60 days of incubation. Contrary to other vascular plants rich in lignin, which degrades slowly, and thus forces the decrease of the delta C-13 values during decay, the delta C-13 values of Z. noltii leaves did not vary significantly over time or between incubation sites. The 515 N values of leaves did not increase as has been reported for vascular plants with high C:N ratio. This suggests that during the early phase of the Z. noltii decomposition the community of decomposers relied mostly on the endogenous nitrogen of the plants, not needing to immobilize exogenous N. Stable isotope studies to assess the contribution of this species to the food web can rely on the natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundances of living tissues without any correction to account for decomposition. The analysis of the delta S-34 values of Z. noltii detritus was not useful probably due to the contamination of the samples with pyrite, which has a depleted delta S-34 signal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Vegetation structure and environmental gradients in the Sallum area, Egypt
T2  - Ecologia Mediterranea
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined vegetation composition and its relation to environmental variables in the Sallum area along the mediterranean coastal land of Egypt. The study area lies between 25 degrees 09'-25 degrees 35'E and 31 degrees 32'-31 degrees 15' N (about 1700km(2)), and extends for about 49 km between Buqbuq and Sallum on the egyptian-libyan frontier. It is included in the semi-desert vegetation zone with an attenuated desert climate. An analysis of vegetation along environmental gradients that prevail in the study area using the relative importance values of 55 perennials in 53 stands, followed by multivariate data analysis was presented. Altogether, 111 species (75 perennials and 36 annuals) belonging to 92 genera and 34 families of the flowering plants were recorded. Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Liliaceae and Zygophyllaceae were the largest families, and constitute more than 64 % of the total recorded species. Therophytes and chamaephytes were the most frequent, denoting a typical desert life-form spectrum. Phytochorological analysis revealed that 45.2 % of the studied species were uniregional, of which 23 % being native to the saharo-arabian chorotype. It also showed the decrease in the numbers of the Mediterranean species and increase of the saharo-arabian species along N-S direction form the see-shore inwards till the Diffa Plateau. Classification of the vegetation was analysed using TWINSPAN technique resulted in the recognition of five vegetation groups, each of definite floristic composition and environmental characteristics, and could be linked to a specific habitat. Haloxylon salicornicum occupied the foot of the Diffa Plateau, Haloxylon salicornicum-Thymelaea hirsuta characterised the sand plains, Thymelaea hirsuta-Anabasis articulata inhabited the non-saline depressions, Haloxylon salicornicum-Atriplex portulacoides characterised the saline depressions and Salsola tetrandra-Limoniastrum monopetalum on the coastal salt marshes. Ordination techniques as DCA and CCA were used to examine the relationship between the vegetation and the studied environmental parameters: electric conductivity (EC), pH, calcium carbonate, moisture content, organic matter, silt, clay, K+, Mg++ and altitude. CCA axis 1 showed significant correlation with clay, moisture content, pH, EC, K+, and altitude, while CCA axis 2 was clearly related to pH, Mg++ and altitude. Species richness was correlated with Mg++, while Shannon index was correlated with Na+ and Mg++.

AB  - The sedimentary organic matter content of a series of 2-m-deep cores was investigated along a sea-land transect at five sites representing five species of mangrove and salt-marsh vegetation. The vegetation was settled at the same place for at least 1000 years and therefore sedimentary organic matter deriving from the decay of higher plants has accumulated in large amounts. The global morphological and chemical preservation of the organic matter attested by various sedimentary parameters, including the proportions of cellulose-bearing tissues, the TOC contents, the C/N ratios, the total sulphur contents and the delta(13)C compositions, reveals that the sedimentary organic matter is less degraded when it has been under the influence of the marine water table for a long time. This is indicated by a good correlation between the salinities of interstitial waters, the redox potentials measured in the wet sediments and the chemical composition of the organic matter. Moreover, the concentration of organic sulphur shows a positive correlation with the hydrogen index (HI), only under the marine water-table influence, suggesting the very local presence of sulphur-HC compounds.

TI  - Varying Inundation Regimes Differentially Affect Natural and Sand-Amended Marsh Sediments
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.

TI  - A comparison of sediment microbial communities associated with Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora in two brackish wetlands of New Jersey
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive spread of Phragmites australis throughout brackish marshes on the East Coast of the United States is a major factor governing management and restoration decisions because it is assumed that biogeochemical functions are altered by the invasion. Microbial activity is important in providing wetland biogeochemical functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, but there is little known about sediment microbial communities in Phragmites marshes. Microbial populations associated with invasive Phragmites vegetation and with native salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, may differ in the relative abundance of microbial taxa (community structure) and in the ability of this biota to decompose organic substrates (community biogeochemical function). This study compares sediment microbial communities associated with Phragmites and Spartina vegetation in an undisturbed brackish marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey (MUL), and in a brackish marsh in the anthropogenically affected Hackensack Meadowlands (SMC). We use phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and enzymatic activity to profile sediment microbial communities associated with both plants in each site. Sediment analyses include bulk density, total organic matter, and root biomass. PLFA profiles indicate that the microbial communities differ between sites with the undisturbed site exhibiting greater fatty acid richness (62 PLFA recovered from MUL versus 38 from SMC). Activity of the 5 enzymes analyzed (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, chitobiase, and 2 oxidases) was higher in the undisturbed site. Differences between vegetation species as measured by Principal Components Analysis were significantly greater at the undisturbed MUL site than at SMC, and patterns of enzyme activity and PLFAs did not correspond to patterns of root biomass. We suggest that in natural wetland sediments, macrophyte rhizosphere effects influence the community composition of sediment microbial populations. Physical and chemical site disturbances may impose limits on these rhizosphere effects, decreasing sediment microbial diversity and potentially, microbial biogeochemical functions.

Detritus was added to stimulate the development of a decomposition community within the sediment and illumination was intended to promote development of a photosynthetic community near the sediment surface.  By including these two experimental treatments of the sediment in a factorial design, we were able to define the individual and combined effects of detrital enrichment and illumination over 73 days.  O2 flux was used as an index of the net effect of photosynthesis and decomposition.  Two techniques - one based on the measurement of O2 gradients in a stationary water column and the other based on O2 transfer from a stirred water column - were used to estimate flux.  Fluxes in stirred cores were consistently higher than measurements taken using the gradient technique.  Detrital enrichment resulted in significantly increased O2 flux in both illuminated and dark cores, regardless of the measurement technique.  In contrast, ATP and community biomass were significantly increased only by the combined effects of illumination and detritus.  The addition of detritus or illumination acting alone did not result in a significant increase in ATP biomass over the long term.  Multivariate ANOVA indicated that the response of the benthic community was dominated by the growth of nonpigmented, flagellated protozoans in the size range of 1-8-mu-m.  These, together with pennate diatoms and filamentous green algae attained significantly higher biomass only in response to a combination of illumination and detritus enrichment.

TI  - CULICOIDES RESPONSES TO 1-OCTEN-3-OL AND CARBON-DIOXIDE IN SALT MARSHES NEAR SEA ISLAND, GEORGIA, USA
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The semiochemicals carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol (octenol) were evaluated as attractants at several release rates, alone and in combination, for the major coastal species of biting midges in Georgia: Culicoides furens, C. hollensis and C. melleus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). The data show that CO2 is an effective attractant for the females of all three species, but each has a different response pattern. In contrast, octenol was an effective attractant only for C. furens, either alone or in combination with CO2; octenol had a repellent effect on the other two species. The combination of octenol and CO2 had a synergistic effect on the collections of C. furens.

TI  - Long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community from oil-spill impact: vegetation response and mitigating effects of marsh surface elevation
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills can have significant, short-term, negative impacts on coastal marshes, but the long-term effects and eventual recovery are not well documented, particularly in brackish marshes. The goals of this investigation were to: (1) document the long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community impacted by a 1985 oil spill; (2) separate the effect of the oil spill on marsh deterioration from ambient rates of marsh deterioration; and (3) assess the relative importance of residual oil in the sediment and decreased marsh surface elevation in the failure of certain areas to recover. A total of 68 permanent plots previously established in 1985 were re-surveyed for plant and soil recovery in the fall of 1989. Although substantial (and near total) vegetative recovery was evident by significant increases in live and total vegetative cover,many of the plots that were initially heavily impacted by oil still displayed elevated levels of total saturated hydrocarbons in the soil. August 1990 measurements of plant photosynthetic response and edaphic variables revealed no significant differences between control plots and plots heavily impacted by oil that displayed vegetative regrowth. Rates of wetland land loss in the oiled marsh during an 8-year period that bracketed the time of the spill were within the historical range measured for this site and similar to the land loss rates of adjacent reference marshes. Results from a manipulative field transplant experiment indicated that the long-term failure of certain small areas to revegetate was primarily due to a decrease of marsh surface elevation (increased flooding stress), not a residual oil effect.

TI  - NaCl impact on Kosteletzkya pentacarpos seedlings simultaneously exposed to cadmium and zinc toxicities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Data regarding NaCl impact on halophyte plant species exposed to a polymetallic contamination remain scarce. Seedlings of the salt marsh species Kosteletzkya pentacarpos were simultaneously exposed to cadmium (10 mu M) and zinc (100 mu M) in the absence or presence of 50 mM NaCl. Heavy metal exposure reduced plant growth and increased Cd and Zn concentrations in all organs. Cd and Zn accumulation reduced net photosynthesis in relation to stomatal closure, decreased in chlorophyll concentration and alteration in chlorophyll fluorescence-related parameters. Salinity reduced Cd and Zn bioaccumulation and translocation, with a higher impact on Cd than Zn. It mitigated the deleterious impact of heavy metals on photosynthetic parameters. NaCl reduced the heavy metal-induced oxidative stress assessed by malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and H2O2 concentration. Subcellular distribution revealed that Cd mainly accumulated in the cell walls, but NaCl increased it in the cytosol fraction in the leaf and in the metal-rich granule fraction in the roots. It had no impact on Zn subcellular distribution. The additional NaCl contributed to a higher sequestration of Cd on phytochelatins and stimulated glutathione synthesis. The positive impact of NaCl on K. pentacarpos response to polymetallic pollution made this species a promising candidate for revegetation of heavy metal-contaminated salt areas.

TI  - Vertical distribution of macrobenthic community of tropical saltmarshes on the Amazon coast
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are coastal plant formations frequently found associated with tropical and subtropical mangroves. Saltmarshes in these regions are subject to a wide array of environmental factors. This vegetation has direct and indirect effects on benthic fauna structure both above and below sediment surface. This study describes the vertical distribution of macrobenthic fauna in Amazon saltmarshes with different sediment characteristics. Four vertical stratified samples (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were collected at two different sites: (1) Furo Grande tidal channel (muddy area) and (2) Ajuruteua beach (sandy area). The saltmarsh area varied between sites, being more dense and taller in the sandy area. A total of 1959 individuals were found, belonging to 35 macrobenthic taxa, of which 23 taxa are exclusive to the muddy area. Macrobenthic fauna community distribution varies among Spartina alterniflora marshes with different sediment characteristics. Higher densities and number of taxa were generally found at near-surface layers (0-10 cm). Furthermore, this vertical distribution occurs differently depending on the site and is more prominent in sandy areas where all fauna is concentrated near the surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sea-level change during the last 2500 years in New Jersey, USA
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative sea-level changes during the last similar to 2500 years in New Jersey, USA were reconstructed to test if late Holocene sea level was stable or included persistent and distinctive phases of variability. Foraminifera and bulk-sediment delta C-13 values were combined to reconstruct paleomarsh elevation with decimeter precision from sequences of salt-marsh sediment at two sites using a multi-proxy approach. The additional paleoenvironmental information provided by bulk-sediment delta C-13 values reduced vertical uncertainty in the sea-level reconstruction by about one third of that estimated from foraminifera alone using a transfer function. The history of sediment deposition was constrained by a composite chronology. An age-depth model developed for each core enabled reconstruction of sea level with multi-decadal resolution. Following correction for land-level change (1.4 mm/yr), four successive and sustained (multi-centennial) sea-level trends were objectively identified and quantified (95% confidence interval) using error-in-variables change point analysis to account for age and sea-level uncertainties. From at least 500 BC to 250 AD, sea-level fell at 0.11 mm/yr. The second period saw sea-level rise at 0.62 mm/yr from 250 AD to 733 AD. Between 733 AD and 1850 AD, sea level fell at 0.12 mm/yr. The reconstructed rate of sea-level rise since similar to 1850 AD was 3.1 mm/yr and represents the most rapid period of change for at least 2500 years. This trend began between 1830 AD and 1873 AD. Since this change point, reconstructed sea-level rise is in agreement with regional tide-gauge records and exceeds the global average estimate for the 20th century. These positive and negative departures from background rates demonstrate that the late Holocene sea level was not stable in New Jersey. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Humic substances in estuarine soils colonized by Spartina maritima
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes humic substances (HS) from two soils colonized by Spartina maritima at different physiographical positions in estuarine environments on the north-western coast of the Iberian Peninsula: the Villaviciosa site, a stand close to the main tidal channel, and the Ortigueira site, located in the low salt marsh. Humic and fulvic acids were extracted from the soils and characterized qualitatively by the following spectroscopic techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.The characterized HS showed a predominance of low humified compounds with a high proportion of aliphatic components and a low degree of aromaticity. The HS composition differed substantially between sites. In the Villaviciosa soil, the large amount of nonpolar aliphatic components and the very low degree of aromaticity may indicate a significant contribution of marine organic matter and/or microbial material to the HS. However, in the HS from the Ortigueira soil, the higher proportion of polysaccharides together with the presence of lignin-derived compounds may indicate greater inputs of vascular plant material. The delta C-13 isotopic Composition of the bulk soils highlights the large input of Spartina maritima debris to the Ortigueira site. whereas in the Villaviciosa site, organic contributions from this C4 vascular plant were not so evident.The results indicate that in these soils colonized by Spartina maritima, physiographical position has an important effect on the composition of soil HS and, therefore, must be considered in the study of organic matter characteristics in such estuarine environments.

TI  - Accumulation of Carbonates Contributes to Coastal Vegetated Ecosystems Keeping Pace With Sea Level Rise in an Arid Region (Arabian Peninsula)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic sea level rise (SLR) presents one of the greatest risks to human lives and infrastructures. Coastal vegetated ecosystems, that is, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, elevate the seabed through soil accretion, providing a natural coastline protection against SLR. The soil accretion of these ecosystems has never been assessed in hot desert climate regions, where water runoff is negligible. However, tropical marine ecosystems are areas of intense calcification that may constitute an important source of sediment supporting seabed elevation, compensating for the lack of terrestrial inputs. We estimated the long-term (C-14-centennial) and short-term (Pb-210-20th century) soil accretion rates (SARs) and inorganic carbon (C-inorg) burial in coastal vegetated ecosystems of the Saudi coasts of the central Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Short-term SARs (SE) in mangroves of the Red Sea (0.270.22cm/year) were twofold the SLR for that region since 1925 (0.13cm/year). In the Arabian Gulf, only mangrove forest SAR is equivalent to local SLR estimates for the period 1979-2007 (0.210.09 compared to 0.220.05cm/year, respectively). Long-term SARs are comparable or higher than the global estimates of SLR for the late Holocene (0.01cm/year). In all habitats of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, SARs are supported by high carbonate accretion rates, comprising 40% to 60% of the soil volume. Further studies on the role of carbonates in coastal vegetated ecosystems are required to understand their role in adaptation to SLR.Plain Language Summary Marine wetlands: mangroves, salt-marshes, and seagrass beds protect the coast against the human-induced sea level rise worldwide. They trap sediment, and this way elevated the seabeds, at paces equivalent to sea level rise. The amount of sediment trapped is generally linked to riverine inputs and surface runoff. However, in arid tropical regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, this source of sediment to the sea is almost unexistant. We studied the rate of seabed elevation in wetlands of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We found that Mangrove and Seagrass (Red Sea only) seabed elevation rates are equivalent to sea level rise rates of the twentieth century, due to greenhouse gas emissions. This is possible because of accumulation of carbonate sediment coming from coral reefs weathering, replacing terrestrial inputs in the tropical arid area. Our study strengthens the relevance of wetlands to human societies in the mitigation of climate change, and we emphasize the need to protect and restore them.

TI  - Mechanism of removal and retention of heavy metals from the acid mine drainage to coastal wetland in the Patagonian marsh
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The attenuation of the acid mine drainage is one of the most important environmental challenges facing the mining industry worldwide. Mining waste deposits from an ancient metallurgical extraction of heavy metals were found near to the San Antonio marsh in Patagonia. The aim of this work was to determinate which mechanisms regulate the mobilization and retention of metals by acid drainage. A geological and geomorphological survey was carried out and samples from the mining waste deposits and the marsh were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe content, and soil mineralogical composition. Metals in marsh plants were determined in above-and below -ground structures. In the mining waste deposits polymetallic sulphides were recognized where the oxidation and formation of oxy-hydroxides and sulphates of Fe, Cu, Pb and Zn occurs. Then, by the alteration of those minerals, the metals enter in solution and are mobilized with the surface drainage towards the marsh where adsorption in the soils fine fraction and organic matter and/or by plants occurs. Locally, in the mining waste deposits, the precipitation/dissolution of Cu, Pb, and Zn sulphates take place in small centripetal drainage basins. In topographically lower portions of the marsh desorption and removal of metals by tidal flow could also be happen. The results allow to concluding that the marsh adjacent to the mining waste deposits is a geochemically active environment that naturally mitigates the contamination caused by acid drainage.

AB  - This data set reports net methane (CH4) emissions from managed saline ponds and a restored salt marsh associated with the South Bay Salt Ponds Restoration Project, San Francisco Bay, CA, USA.  Associated biogeochemical and physical data are also reported.  Data were collected on five sampling dates over the course of the study: November 2016, January 2017, March 2017, June 2017 and August 2017.  Logistics (e.g., weather and road conditions) and nesting birds did not allow us to sample all locations during all sampling events.Methane emissions were measured using static chambers and biogeochemical data were measured on porewater associated with the static chambers.   Data from one flux chamber (Pond A1; November 2016) were removed as an outlier because the measured emissions were more than 20-times higher than the average of other fluxes in the same pond during the same sampling event.

TI  - SULFATE REDUCTION AND IRON SULFIDE MINERAL FORMATION IN GULF OF MEXICO ANOXIC SEDIMENTS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfate reduction and iron sulfide mineral formation were investigated in Mississippi River delta and Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and slope sediments.  Sulfate reduction rates and pyrite concentrations generally decrease exponentially with increasing overlying water depth.  This is probably a result of decreasing sedimentation rates and organic carbon concentrations with increasing water depth.  A linear relationship between sulfate reduction rates and organic carbon concentrations as well as normal marine C/S ratios indicate that organic carbon is probably limiting sulfate reduction and iron sulfide mineral formation in this region.  Organic carbon reactivity appears to be substantially higher in Mississippi River delta sediments than in other sediments from this region.Mississippi River delta and Texas-Louisiana continental shelf sediments are the primary pyrite burial environments.  Of the total pyrite deposition in the study area (approximately 6 x 10(11) g y-1), about 81 percent is deposited in Texas-Louisiana continental shelf sediments and about 15 percent in Mississippi River delta sediments.  The remaining 4 percent is deposited in sediments on the continental slope and the western and southern continental shelf areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the last two decades 228 sites in Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany) were investigated concerning the ground beetles and environmental parameters, i.e. soil pH, soil moisture, sand content, content of organic matter, salinity, tree cover and habitat size. In total 30 assemblages were differentiated that could be significantly characterised by their ground beetle composition and their specific environmental conditions. These were: wet alder carrs, moist alder woods, moderately moist alder woods, deciduous woods on fresh and nutrient rich soils, fresh deciduous or coniferous woods, dry deciduous or coniferous woods, birch woods at the margins of bogs, small moderately open woods, large agrarian fields (> 20 ha) oil loamy soils, medium sized agrarian fields (similar to 10 ha) on loamy soils, small agrarian fields (3-5 ha) on loamy soils, agrarian fields on sandy soils, agrarian fields on extreme sandy soils (90 % sand content), wet grassland fens, wet grassland on weakly brackish fens, moist grassland fens, intensively used grassland on moderately moist fens, fresh agriculturally used grassland, dry agriculturally used grassland, dry grassland on sandy soils, extensively used grassland on sandy soils in transition to dune vegetation, lower salt marsh of the Baltic Sea on fens with high salinity, lower salt marsh of the North Sea on soils with high salinity, upper salt marsh of the North Sea, heath on sandy soils, dunes, heath on bogs, wet dune valleys with Molinia vegetation, moderately dry dunes with Empetrum vegetation, open wet areas of marginal bog ponds, natural bog areas. The strongest difference in tile ground beetle composition was found between tile salty habitats of the coasts and the remaining mainland habitats. Based on the environmental parameters and the occurrence of beetle species an indication index was calculated for 183 ground beetle species ranking the species concerning the mean and variance of their environmental demands. Using the Spearman correlation 24 ecological groups of species were defined considering the combination of environmental conditions. Finally, all species recorded in Schleswig-Holstein are listed and ecologically characterised based on the preceding investigation or on other investigations without such detailed environmental knowledge.

TI  - Herbivore trampling as an alternative pathway for explaining differences in nitrogen mineralization in moist grasslands
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies addressing the role of large herbivores on nitrogen cycling in grasslands have suggested that the direction of effects depends on soil fertility. Via selection for high quality plant species and input of dung and urine, large herbivores have been shown to speed up nitrogen cycling in fertile grassland soils while slowing down nitrogen cycling in unfertile soils. However, recent studies show that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in some temperate fertile soils, but not in others. To explain this, we hypothesize that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in loamy or clay soils through soil compaction, but not in sandy soils. Especially under wet conditions, strong compaction in clay soils can lead to periods of soil anoxia, which reduces decomposition of soil organic matter and, hence, N mineralization. In this study, we use a long-term (37-year) field experiment on a salt marsh to investigate the hypothesis that the effect of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization depends on soil texture. Our results confirm that the presence of large herbivores decreased nitrogen mineralization rate in a clay soil, but not in a sandy soil. By comparing a hand-mown treatment with a herbivore-grazed treatment, we show that these differences can be attributed to herbivore-induced changes in soil physical properties rather than to above-ground biomass removal. On clay soil, we find that large herbivores increase the soil water-filled porosity, induce more negative soil redox potentials, reduce soil macrofauna abundance, and reduce decomposition activity. On sandy soil, we observe no changes in these variables in response to grazing. We conclude that effects of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization cannot be understood without taking soil texture, soil moisture, and feedbacks through soil macrofauna into account.

TI  - CNP stoichiometry and productivity limitations in high-altitude wetland ecosystems of the Eastern Pamir
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied two wetland plant community types that occur on flat lake terraces in the Eastern Pamir mountains (Tajikistan, Central Asia). We selected 13 homogeneous patches of salt marsh vegetation dominated by Blysmus rufus (Huds.) Link, and 20 homogeneous patches of saline small sedge meadow. From each patch we took soil and biomass samples which were analysed in the laboratory. We used delta O-13 and delta N-15 values for plant biomass to determine the type of nutrient limitation and to characterise dominant species, and we assessed the impact of detrital input on the CNP stoichiometry of biomass. Biomass delta C-13 was typical for plants growing under low partial pressure of CO2; while delta N-15 was very high, especially in the leaves of Carex orbicularis Boott. N limitation was indicated for the majority of sampled sites, yet we found no significant correlation between delta O-13 or delta N-15 and N/P quotient. There were pronounced differences in delta N-15 between species, the lowest values being recorded for Carex microglochin Wahlenb. No significant influence of detrital inputs on the chemical composition of plant biomass was detected.

TI  - Coastal plant and soil relationships along the southwestern coast of South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied how plant species distribution was regulated by the relationships between vegetation and soil factors on the southwestern coast of South Korea. Vegetation was classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), thereby producing four vegetation groups that were linked to three habitat types. Two ordination techniques - detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) - were applied to examine the relationships between vegetation and 12 edaphic factors, including soil pH, water and osmotic potentials, moisture content, electrical conductivity, Cl- and Na+ contents, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and contents of organic matter, sand, silt, and clay. Results were similar for both types of evaluations. According to DCA and CCA, the 23 communities tended to cluster into three types: salt swamp, salt marsh, and sand dune. The first two canonical axes accounted for 14.9% of the community-soil factor re,lationship among communities. As identified via CCA, the main gradients were soil-water relations and soil texture.

TI  - Cordgrass canopy elicits weak effects on sediment properties and microphytobenthic abundance in a harsh environment
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude of the outcome of ecosystem engineering is context-dependent; as environmental stresses increase, habitat amelioration by ecosystem engineers becomes more relevant. Moreover, the individual- and population-level traits of ecosystem engineers can affect their ability to reduce environmental stress. On the Patagonian shores of Argentina (SW Atlantic, 41 degrees S), the intertidal community is exposed to harsh conditions. We predicted that in this severe environment, variation in the above-ground structure of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora should buffer the physical stress on the substrate through shading and reduction of wind and water flow energy, ultimately affecting the sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated cordgrass density at the edge and inner marsh of a S. alterniflora meadow during both summer and winter. In summer, evaporation and temperature were higher in clipped plots, while in winter, evaporation varied across densities and location treatments, with higher sediment water content in the inner marsh. No effect of S. alterniflora density or location were observed on sediment organic matter or chl a concentration, and mean sediment grain size was always smaller inside the marsh. In summer, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content was higher in clipped plots inside the marsh, however this did not differ from the other density treatments at this location. Overall, shading had weak effects on sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass, and most observed differences were attributable to grain size. We speculate that the harsh conditions of this system overwhelm the ecosystem engineering effects of S. alterniflora, probably because of its relatively small above-ground biomass.

TI  - An assessment of ocean margin anaerobic processes on oceanic alkalinity budget
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent interest in the ocean's capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2 and buffer the accompanying "ocean acidification" has prompted discussions on the magnitude of ocean margin alkalinity production via anaerobic processes. However, available estimates are largely based on gross reaction rates or misconceptions regarding reaction stoichiometry. In this paper, we argue that net alkalinity gain does not result from the internal cycling of nitrogen and sulfur species or from the reduction of metal oxides. Instead, only the processes that involve permanent loss of anaerobic remineralization products, i.e., nitrogen gas from net denitrification and reduced sulfur (i.e., pyrite burial) from net sulfate reduction, could contribute to this anaerobic alkalinity production. Our revised estimate of net alkalinity production from anaerobic processes is on the order of 4-5 Tmol yr(-1) in global ocean margins that include both continental shelves and oxygen minimum zones, significantly smaller than the previously estimated rate of 16-31 Tmol yr(-1). In addition, pyrite burial in coastal habitats (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows) may contribute another 0.1-1.1 Tmol yr(-1), although their long-term effect is not yet clear under current changing climate conditions and rising sea levels. Finally, we propose that these alkalinity production reactions can be viewed as "charge transfer" processes, in which negative charges of nitrate and sulfate ions are converted to those of bicarbonate along with a net loss of these oxidative anions.

TI  - Natural Dynamics and Control of Soil Gas Oxygen in Wetlands: Fibre-Optic Oxygen Measurements at Two Field Sites in the Doana National Park (Spain)
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen measurements of soil air were carried out to determine daily variations and seasonality of oxygen in soil air and their dependence on ambient parameters such as groundwater chemistry, hydrodynamics and physico-chemical sediment characteristics. Two field sites in the Doana National Park were equipped with fibre-optic oxygen- and temperature sensors down to 6 m below the groundsurface, and oxygen was sampled from November 2010 until July 2012. One of the sites lies in the saltmarshes and the other in the dune belt, so providing coverage of contrasting hydrogeochemical conditions. Sediments from both locations were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters. Furthermore, groundwater levels were measured and samples taken for hydrochemical analysis. Soil gas in the salt marsh ranged from anaerobic conditions during the wet season to aerobic conditions in the dry period, which is related to the anaerobic groundwater and the high amount of electron donors in the sediment. The location in the dune belt yielded aerobic conditions throughout the year due to the minor amount of organic carbon in the sediments and the high oxygen content of the groundwater. The oxygen time series exhibits daily oscillations related to microbiological activity in the root zone of the Juniperus Sabina tree.

TI  - Coupling breakwalls with oyster restoration structures enhances living shoreline performance along energetic shorelines
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest and investment in constructing living shorelines rather than harder engineering structures are on the rise worldwide. However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions - wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of similar to 1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability.

TI  - Isotope reconstruction of plant palaeoecology. Case study of Cenomanian floras from Bohemia
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Palaeoenviroments inferred from stable carbon isotope ratios of fossil plants collected from various environments of the Cenomanian of Bohemia were compared with palaeobotanical and sedimentological data to test the use of isotope ratios as a record of local palaeoenviromnents and fossil-plant ecology. A number of isotope and biogeochemical patterns suggested that stable carbon isotope ratios in the Cenomanian plants from Bohemia have not been significantly affected by diagenesis. Stable carbon isotope ratios of the palaeoflora from one of the sections studied were used as a reference for a non-stressed habitat since both sedimentological and palaeobotanical evidence suggested that the fossil flora underwent no environmental Stresses that Could have influenced its 6degreesC values. Comparisons of delta(13)C values of the other palaeofloras with that of the reference section. allowed inference of the palaeoenvironmental stresses undergone by fossil plants. These palaeoenvironmental patterns deduced from C-13/C-12 ratios are in agreement with the palacoenvironments previously reconstructed by sedimentological and palaeobotanical studies. Combining evidence from those studies with isotope data provided detailed insights into the palaeoecology of the plants studied. Finally, stable carbon isotope ratios allowed precise characterisation of the ecology of the best-represented species of the deposits studied, the ginkgoalean plant Eremophyllum obotsum and the conifer Frenelopsis alata, which were quite common in the salt-marsh environments in Europe during the Cenomanian. Hence, stable carbon isotope ratios can help in evaluating the environmental stresses undergone by fossil plants and the combination of these results with palaeobotanical and sedimentological data can provide detailed insights into fossil-plant ecology.

AB  - In recent decades the encroachment of woody mangrove species into herbaceous marshes has been documented along the U.S. northern Gulf of Mexico coast. These species shifts have been attributed primarily to rising sea levels and warming winter temperatures, but the role of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water availability may become more prominent drivers of species interactions under future climate conditions. In this greenhouse study we examined the effects of CO2 concentration (ambient, elevated) and water regime (drought, saturated, flooded) on early growth of the mangrove species Avicennia germinans and Spartina alterniflora, a herbaceous grass.

TI  - Phytoremediation as a management option for contaminated sediments in tidal marshes, flood control areas and dredged sediment landfill sites
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Polluted sediments in rivers may be transported by the river to the sea, spread over river banks and tidal marshes or managed, i.e. actively dredged and disposed of on land. Once sedimented on tidal marshes, alluvial areas or control flood areas, the polluted sediments enter semi-terrestrial ecosystems or agro-ecosystems and may pose a risk. Disposal of polluted dredged sediments on land may also lead to certain risks. Up to a few years ago, contaminated dredged sediments were placed in confined disposal facilities. The European policy encourages sediment valorisation and this will be a technological challenge for the near future. Currently, contaminated dredged sediments are often not valorisable due to their high content of contaminants and their consequent hazardous properties. In addition, it is generally admitted that treatment and re-use of heavily contaminated dredged sediments is not a cost-effective alternative to confined disposal. For contaminated sediments and associated disposal facilities used in the past, a realistic, low cost, safe, ecologically sound and sustainable management option is required. In this context, phytoremediation is proposed in the literature as a management option. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge on management, (phyto)remediation and associated risks in the particular case of sediments contaminated with organic and inorganic pollutants.This paper deals with the following features: (1) management and remediation of contaminated sediments and associated risk assessment; (2) management options for ecosystems on polluted sediments, based on phytoremediation of contaminated sediments with focus on phytoextraction, phytostabilisation and phytoremediation of organic pollutants and (3) microbial and mycorrhizal processes occurring in contaminated sediments during phytoremediation.In this review, an overview is given of phytoremediation as a management option for semi-terrestrial and terrestrial ecosystems affected by polluted sediments, and the processes affecting pollutant bioavailability in the sediments. Studies that combine contaminated sediment and phytoremediation are relatively recent and are increasing in number since few years. Several papers suggest including phytoremediation in a management scheme for contaminated dredged sediments and state that phytoremediation can contribute to the revaluation of land-disposed contaminated sediments. The status of sediments, i.e. reduced or oxidised, highly influences contaminant mobility, its (eco)toxicity and the success of phytoremediation. Studies are performed either on near-fresh sediment or on sediment-derived soil. Field studies show temporal negative effects on plant growth due to oxidation and subsequent ageing of contaminated sediments disposed on land. The review shows that a large variety of plants and trees are able to colonise or develop on contaminated dredged sediment in particular conditions or events (e.g. high level of organic matter, clay and moisture content, flooding, seasonal hydrological variations). Depending on the studies, trees, high-biomass crop species and graminaceous species could be used to degrade organic pollutants, to extract or to stabilise inorganic pollutants. Water content of sediment is a limiting factor for mycorrhizal development. In sediment, specific bacteria may enhance the mobilisation of inorganic contaminants whereas others may participate in their immobilisation. Bacteria are also able to degrade organic pollutants. Their actions may be increased in the presence of plants.Choice of plants is particularly crucial for phytoremediation success on contaminated sediments. Extremely few studies are long-term field-based studies. Short-term effects and resilience of ecosystems is observed in long-term studies, i.e. due to degradation and stabilisation of pollutants. Terrestrial ecosystems affected by polluted sediments range from riverine tidal marshes with several interacting processes and vegetation development mainly determined by hydrology, over alluvial soils affected by overbank sedimentation (including flood control areas), to dredged sediment disposal facilities where hydrology and vegetation might be affected or managed by human intervention. This gradient is also a gradient of systems with highly variable soil and hydrological conditions in a temporal scale (tidal marshes) versus systems with a distinct soil development over time (dredged sediment landfill sites).In some circumstances (e.g. to avoid flooding or to ensure navigation) dredging operations are necessary. Management and remediation of contaminated sediments are necessary to reduce the ecological risks and risks associated with food chain contamination and leaching. Besides disposal, classical remediation technologies for contaminated sediment also extract or destroy contaminants. These techniques imply the sediment structure deterioration and prohibitive costs. On the contrary, phytoremediation could be a low-cost option, particularly suited to in situ remediation of large sites and environmentally friendly. However, phytoremediation is rarely included in the management scheme of contaminated sediment and accepted as a viable option.Phytoremediation is still an emerging technology that has to prove its sustainability at field scale. Research needs to focus on optimisations to enhance applicability and to address the economic feasibility of phytoremediation.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Pb-210-derived sediment and carbon accumulation rates in vegetated coastal ecosystems - setting the record straight
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems, including tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, are being increasingly assessed in terms of their potential for carbon dioxide sequestration worldwide. However, there is a paucity of studies that have effectively estimated the accumulation rates of sediment organic carbon (C-org), also termed blue carbon, beyond the mere quantification of C-org stocks. Here, we discuss the use of the Pb-210 dating technique to determine the rate of C-org accumulation in these habitats. We review the most widely used Pb-210 dating models to assess their limitations in these ecosystems, often composed of heterogeneous sediments with varying inputs of organic material, that are disturbed by natural and anthropogenic processes resulting in sediment mixing and changes in sedimentation rates or erosion. Through a range of simulations, we consider the most relevant processes that impact the Pb-210 records in vegetated coastal ecosystems and evaluate how anomalies in Pb-210 specific activity profiles affect sediment and C-org accumulation rates. Our results show that the discrepancy in sediment and derived C-org accumulation rates between anomalous and ideal Pb-210 profiles is within 20% if the process causing such anomalies is well understood. While these discrepancies might be acceptable for the determination of mean sediment and C-org accumulation rates over the last century, they may not always provide a reliable geochronology or historical reconstruction. Reliable estimates of C-org accumulation rates might be difficult at sites with slow sedimentation, intense mixing and/or that are affected by multiple sedimentary processes. Additional tracers or geochemical, ecological or historical data need to be used to validate the Pb-210-derived results. The framework provided in this study can be instrumental in reducing the uncertainties associated with estimates of C-org accumulation rates in vegetated coastal sediments.

TI  - A Fused Radar-Optical Approach for Mapping Wetlands and Deepwaters of the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast Regions of the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, storm surge mitigation, water filtration, and wildlife habitat provision while supporting high levels of biodiversity. Despite their importance, monitoring these systems over large scales remains challenging due to difficulties in obtaining extensive up-to-date ground surveys and the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery for effective space-borne monitoring. In this study, we developed methodologies to advance the monitoring of tidal marshes and adjacent deepwaters in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast United States. We combined Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 optical imagery to classify marshes and open water in both regions, with user's and producer's accuracies exceeding 89%. This methodology enables the assessment of marsh loss through conversion to open water at an annual resolution. We used time-series Sentinel-1 imagery to classify persistent and non-persistent marsh vegetation with greater than 93% accuracy. Non-persistent marsh vegetation serves as an indicator of salinity regimes in tidal wetlands. Additionally, we mapped two invasive species: wetlands invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) with greater than 80% accuracy and deepwater invasive Trapa natans (water chestnut) with greater than 96% accuracy. These results have important implications for improved monitoring and management of coastal wetlands ecosystems.

TI  - Discerning the mechanisms of coexistence between marine cren/thaumarchaea and marine bacteria via stable isotope probing
T2  - Rutgers University Community Repository
M3  - Data set
AB  - Marine mesophilic archaea were discovered two decades ago. However, the role of these culture-resistant organisms in marine nutrient cycling and the nature of their relationship with bacteria have yet to be elucidated. Current thinking is that thaumarchaea may dominate ammonia oxidation in sediments and oxygen minimum zones, based on the ubiquity of archaeal ammmonium monooxygenase genes. Yet, ammonia-oxidation (or other forms of autotrophy/mixotrophy) may only represent a subset of the full metabolic capability of the phylum. The purpose of this Ph.D. research was to assess whether estuary and marine archaea are autotrophic or heterotrophic and if they compete with bacteria for the same electron donors and acceptors. Salt marsh sediments from a New Jersey state park were screened for heterotrophy using stable isotope probing, by amending with a single 13C-labeled compound (acetate, glycine, or urea), a complex 13C-biopolymer (lipids, proteins, or growth medium), or autotrophy using 13C-bicarbonate. 13C-labeled DNA was analyzed by TRFLP analysis of 16S rRNA genes. SIP analyses indicated salt marsh thaumarchaea and crenarchaea are heterotrophic, double within 2-3 days and often compete with heterotrophic bacteria for the same organic substrates. A clone library of 13C-amplicons was screened to find matches to the 13C-TRFLP peaks. Some of these archaea displayed a preference for particular carbon sources, whereas others incorporated nearly every 13C-substrate provided. Resource partitioning of proteins, and urea at low concentrations, was also observed. SIP was also performed in the open waters of the Sargasso Sea at multiple depths and latitudes, using 13C-labeled acetate, urea, and bicarbonate. In this environment, mixotrophy appeared to be the dominant metabolic strategy, though some heterotrophic OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were observed. No exclusively autotrophic OTUs were detected. Urea was also a competitive substrate in deep waters, with archaea outcompeting bacteria for its uptake in the majority of microcosms. Archaea-specific and bacteria-specific predators were detected via incorporation of 13C into eukaryotic OTUs. This research demonstrates the significance of organic carbon uptake and selective predation on the structuring of marine archaeal communities.

TI  - Anoxic decomposition in sediments from a tropical mangrove forest and the temperate Wadden Sea: Implications of N and P addition experiments
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The anoxic decomposition processes in sediments from a tropical mangrove forest (Bangrong, Thailand) and a salt marsh in the temperate Wadden Sea (Denmark) were compared, and the effects of increased ammonium and/or phosphate concentrations on the anoxic decomposition were studied. Sediment was incubated in jars (20-ml glass vials) and changes in porewater solutes were followed in a time series of 3 weeks. Furthermore, the short-term fate (days) of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) added to Bangrong mangrove sediment was evaluated from phosphorus fractionation. Although the organic matter at both study sites had relatively high C:N and C:P ratios, the anoxic sediment decomposition was not affected by nutrient enrichments at the level applied in this study. The sediment metabolism (TCO2 and DOC production, and sulfate consumption) was 5-10 times higher in Wadden Sea sediment than in Bangrong mangrove sediment, probably due to the higher content of structural carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose) as indicated by higher C:N and C:P ratios in mangrove organic matter. This is substantiated by a lower nutrient release from Bangrong mangrove sediments and suggests a faster turnover of N and P by nutrient deficient bacteria in the mangrove sediment. DIP was released during anoxic decomposition in Wadden Sea sediment, but was retained in Bangrong mangrove sediment. Analysis of phosphor-us fractions in Bangrong mangrove sediment revealed that added excess DIP was efficiently taken up by the sediment particles and primarily retrieved in the easily exchangeable and iron bound fractions. The studied mangrove forest sediment seems to be a phosphorus sink. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI  - Trophic ecology of nematodes from various microhabitats of the Roscoff Aber Bay (France): importance of stranded macroalgae evidenced through delta C-13 and delta N-15
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal diversity of food sources of intertidal nematodes of 3 different feeding habitats (estuarine muddy sediments, Spartina maritima and Juncus maritimus marshes) in the Roscoff Aber Bay, France, was assessed by the use of delta(13)C and delta(15)N values. Within the bay, nematodes largely dominated within the total meiofauna. Throughout the 3 sampling periods, the delta(13)C and delta(15)N values for nematodes and sources showed that the dominant sedimentary organic matter sources within the 3 microhabitats considered, namely terrigeneous inputs, detrital Spartina maritima or Juncus maritimus and marine POM, did not contribute a significant part of the diet to locally occurring nematodes. In fact, the delta(13)C and delta(15)N values indicate that organic matter derived from stranded macroalgae, mostly Enteromorpha sp. and Fucus spiralis, was the primary contributor to the assimilated food sources of nematodes; more readily utilisable sources (i.e. benthic diatoms) are virtually absent. The present work provides evidence that detrital pathways, including stranded macroalgae from nearby rocks and free-living nematodes, play a key role in the trophic ecology of intertidal flat areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - A population of Ulva rotundata (Bliding, C., A critical survey of European taxa in Ulvales.  Part I.  Opt. Bot. Lund, A8 (3), 1-160) was studied for 7 months in a shallow brackish eutrophic lagoon (Prevost Lagoon, Languedoc, France).  Biomass was measured in square-meter quadrates, and algal growth in on-site cages.  Carbon and nitrogen levels were spatiotemporally monitored in Ulva thalli and in particulate organic matter.  Thalli rapidly degraded into particulate matter from the surface to the bottom, increasing nitrogen concentrations and decreasing carbon concentrations.  We propose a method for estimating algal production and possible carbon loss in this type of lagoon, based on nitrogen levels in particulate organic matter.  Algal production over the whole period can be evaluated by adding instantaneous biomass levels corresponding to the main particulate nitrogen peaks.

TI  - Mobility of selected trace elements in Mediterranean red soil amended with phosphogypsum: experimental study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil amendment by phosphogypsum (PG) application becomes of increasing importance in agriculture. This may lead, however, to soil, plant, and groundwater contamination with trace elements (TEs) inherently present in PG. Monitoring of selected TEs (Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd) distribution and mobility in a Mediterranean red soil profile has been performed in soil parcels applied with PG over a 16-month period. Concentrations were measured in soil and plant samples collected from various depth intervals at different points in time. TEs sequential extraction was performed on soil and PG samples. Results showed soil profile enrichment peaked 5 months after PG application for Cd, and 12 months for Pb, Zn, and Cu. Rainwater, pH, total organic carbon, and cationic exchange capacity were the main controlling factors in TEs accumulation in soils. Cd was transferred to a soil depth of about 20 cm. Zn exhibited mobility towards deeper layers. Pb and Cu were accumulated in around 20-55-cm-deep layers. PG increased the solubility of the studied TEs; PG-applied soils contained TEs bound to exchangeable and acid-soluble fractions in higher percentages than reference soil. Pb, Zn, and Cu were sorbed into mineral soil phases, while Cd was mainly found in the exchangeable (bio-available) form. The order of TEs decreasing mobility was Zn > Cd > Pb > Cu. Roots and leaves of existed plants, Cichorium intybus L., accumulated high concentrations of Cd (1-2.4 mg/kg), exceeding recommended tolerable levels, and thus signifying potential health threats through contaminated crops. It was therefore recommended that PG should be applied in carefully established, monitored, and controlled quantities to agricultural soils.

TI  - Effects of land use intensity on soil nutrient distribution after reclamation in an estuary landscape
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of time on the evolution of land use intensity and soil nutrients distribution were studied in a reclamation zone of the Yangtze Estuary. Land use types were grouped into five intensity levels according to the extent of human disturbance. We used the "space for time substitution" method to test the impact of time on changes in land use intensity after reclamation and found that land use levels increased quickly within the first 35 years, then slowed. Soil salinity was relatively higher in aquaculture ponds than that in areas with other types of land cover due to the use of saline water from underground and the sea. Soil organic matter, available phosphorous and nitrate nitrogen were relatively high in agricultural fields, while nitrate nitrogen was highly variable in agricultural fields. The variations of all four soil properties in the built-up zone were much higher than those in the other land use groups. The spatial distribution of different nutrients is the combined effect of time and land use post reclamation. The results will provide a sound basis for future land use planning of newly reclaimed land, and for further studies on ecological consequences of salt marsh reclamation.

TI  - European salt marshes diversity and functioning: The case study of the Mont Saint-Michel bay, France
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The macrotidal Mont Saint-Michel bay has been studied intensively since 1990. The objectives of this study, supported by the European Union, was to understand various processes underlying the functioning of this hydro-system with a special focus on organic matter and nutrient fluxes between saltmarshes and marine waters. This paper presents a synopsis of these studies. The tidal flats are unvegetated and primary production is exclusively due to microphytobenthos communities dominated by diatoms. Halophile plant communities colonize the top parts of the tidal flats. Their composition and production vary according to a maturity gradient and sheep grazing. In ungrazed saltmashes, production ranged from 1080 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in the lower marsh to 1990 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in the upper marsh whereas it was only 200 to 500 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in Salicornia spp. dominated pioneer zones and sheep grazed areas. Most of this organic matter (OM) was trapped in situ, processed by fungi and bacteria, and then released seaward via tidal fluxes, groundwater and runoff as particulate OM and nutrients: -497 kg N, -1200/-1000 kg P-PO4 and -9900/-4200 kg inorganic carbon). A small amount of OM was exported to the bay as macrodetritus. Fatty acids and stable isotopes, used as markers, showed that OM produced by the marsh halophytes contributed to the diet of all the tidal flats invertebrates that were studied. Transient fish species were shown to colonize the saltmarshes to forage or graze, exporting about 50 tons POM (DW)cntdoty-1. Therefore, it is assumed that the saltmarsh production enhances the production of the whole bay. But the functioning is still poorly known because the nutrient sinks have not all been identified. Part of the nutrients input was provided by precipitation (+327 kg y-1), but the contribution of the catchments was not quantified despite the fact that their influence was shown by the presence of lindane in all the compartments of the system. Dynamics of saltmarshes are mainly influenced by natural sedimentation (1.5 million m3cntdoty-1 in the bay), plant community succession, and management (i.e., reclamation and agricultural activities).

TI  - Level and Degradation of Deepwater Horizon Spilled Oil in Coastal Marsh Sediments and Pore-Water
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates the level and degradation of oil at ten selected Gulf saltmarsh sites months after the 2010 BP Macondo-1 well oil spill. Very high levels (10-28%) of organic carbon within the heavily oiled sediments are clearly distinguished from those in pristine sediments (<3%). Dissolved organic carbon in contaminated pore waters, ranging up to hundreds of mg/kg, are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those at pristine sites. Heavily oiled sediments are characterized by very high sulfide concentrations (up to 80 mg/kg) and abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria. Geochemical biomarkers and stable carbon isotope analyses fingerprint the presence of oils in sediments. Ratios of selected parameters calculated from the gas chromatograph spectra are in a remarkable narrow range among spilled oils and initial BP crude. At oiled sites dominated by C-4 plants, delta C-13 values of sediments (-20.8 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand) have been shifted significantly lower compared to marsh plants (-14.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) due to the inflow of isotopically lighter oil (-27 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand). Our results show that (1) lighter compounds of oil are quickly degraded by microbes while the heavier fractions of oil still remain and (2) higher inputs of organic matter from the oil spill enhance the key microbial processes associated with sulfate reducing bacteria.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE OILSEED HALOPHYTE SALICORNIA-BIGELOVII TORR IN ARID BAJA-CALIFORNIA-SUR, MEXICO
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its geographical situation, Baja California Sur is the most arid Mexican state, with the longest length of coast in the country.  Hence, the study of halophytes for incorporation into rural agriculture is a priority for this region.  In this research, the growth and development of a natural population of the oilseed halophyte Salicornia bigelovii Torr. as affected by environmental factors are analysed.  Four transects were traced in the field, with sample sites of 1 m2 every 3 m along each transect from which samples of soil and plants for laboratory analysis were taken, starting at the lowest seashore tide line.  Edaphic and environmental factors as well as biomass, plant density, size, and dry matter were analysed through multivariate statistical methods.  Three edaphic factors showed correlation with growth and development of individuals:  growth was positively correlated with soil organic matter, and negatively correlated with the percentage of sand as a component of texture and with the balance of sodium (SAR parameter) in the soil saturated paste.  Part of the results are unexpected because most of the previous work had dealt only with the salinity factor.  The results will enable us to determine the next steps to promote the economic use of this species in the study region.

TI  - Carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) and elemental (TOC, TN) geochemistry in saltmarsh surface sediments (Western Brittany, France): a useful tool for reconstructing Holocene relative sea-level
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing a dense network of Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) records still faces some challenges, such as the paucity of microfossil assemblages within some Holocene sedimentary sequences. Recently, the isotopic (delta C-13) and elemental geochemistry [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratios] of saltmarsh sediments has showed potential for RSL reconstruction. This study presents the results of new delta C-13, TOC and TN measurements obtained on surface sediments of two marshes of the Brittany region (France). Overall, the distribution of delta C-13, TOC, TN and C/N values shows clear dependencies with elevation. Sediments from above and below the high tide level show contrasting TN contents. Clustering analyses identified three elevation-dependent groups, characterized by specific values of delta C-13, TOC and TN. The use of this geochemical reference for RSL reconstruction is tested on a core retrieved from one of the marshes. The sea-level index points obtained plot in good accordance with the microfauna-based RSL positions previously obtained in the region. Some diagenetic losses in TN are observed between modern and Holocene sediments. This does not appear to be harmful to the accuracy of the RSL reconstructions but suggests that C/N ratios may be unreliable palaeoenvironmental proxies in this specific context.

AB  - Lithostratigraphic studies in north-central Fenland reveal the occurrence of a silty clay unit separating fen peat deposits from saltmarsh clayey silt deposits. Lithological and organic carbon data show gradual transitions from the underlying fen and to the overlying saltmarsh palaeoenvironments. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate pedogenic alteration of the deposits substantiated by percentage carbonate carbon data. Palynological data reveal a development from Betula carr to saltmarsh via an intermediate environment with pollen and spores derived from both seaward and landward facies. Analysis and interpretation suggest that the silty clay unit was deposited in a brackish open water habitat as a result of freshwater and tidal pending behind the saltmarsh. The evidence suggest the existence of a previously unrecorded successional environment between coastal reedswamp and saltmarsh facies. This environment occurred in broad, shallow gradient coastal settings during periods of rapid saltmarsh growth. No modem comparable environment exists due to the effect of drainage and sea defence schemes. Comparison is made with other sites within Fenland.

TI  - Secondary productivity of macrobenthos in intertidal flat of Luoyuan Bay, Fujian Province of East China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the survey data of macrobenthos in the intertidal flat of Luoyuan Bay in 2009, and by using Brey's empirical formula, this paper estimated the macrobenthos secondary productivity, production/biomass (P/B) ratio, and their spatiotemporal distribution patterns in the flat. The annual secondary productivity and P/B ratio of the macrobenthos in the flat were estimated as 18.58 g AFDM (ash free dry mass) . m(-2) . a(-1) and 0.97, respectively, and the secondary productivity in the Spartina alterniflora marshes of the upper intertidal flat (8.97g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)) was much lower than that in the bare flat of the lower intertidal zone (28.19 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), Since the introduction of S. alterniflora by the end of the 1980s, the secondary productivity of the macrobenthos in the flat had increased about 4 folds. Musculus senhousei, which inhabited in the lower bare flat, contributed 66.4% of the total macrobenthos secondary productivity in the entire intertidal flat. If the contribution from M. senhousei was not taken into account, the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the salt marshes would be significantly higher than that in the bare flat, and the macrobenthos secondary productivity in the intertidal flat would have less change. The successful colonization of M. senhousei was partly attributed to the changes of sediment composition enhanced by S. alterniflora due to its capability in trapping fine-grained materials; this species' feeding activities result in a remarkable increase of sediment chlorophyll a content. There was a significant positive correlation between the secondary productivity of macrobenthos and the sediment chlorophyll a and/or organic matter contents. These findings suggested that salt marshes had effects on the coastal wetland ecosystem via a number of physical and biological mechanisms.

TI  - A Synthesis of Deepwater Horizon Impacts on Coastal and Nearshore Living Marine Resources
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico began on April 20, originating in the deep sea 66 km off the Louisiana coast. By early June, DWH oil had spread to coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida. An estimated 2,113 km of shoreline were oiled, making DWH the largest marine oil spill in global history by length of affected shoreline. Additionally, a series of oil spill response measures were deployed, including diversions of Mississippi River discharge to forestall oil coming ashore, and the establishment of large-scale fishery closures, with both affecting coastal resources to varying degrees. Here, we review published studies and describe additional analyses evaluating long-term impacts of DWH on coastal/nearshore biological resources. We assembled time-series data collected by state, federal and academic partners on population abundance and environmental conditions to evaluate species and community change. Our study focused on plankton, invertebrates, fishes and dolphins, and 13 "key species" were selected to conduct semi-quantitative vulnerability-resilience (V-R) analyses. At one extreme, early life stages of Gulf Menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) were not affected due to seasonal spawning and larval development preceding the spill. In contrast, demographically independent populations of the common Bottlenose Dolphin, (Tursiops truncatus) suffered a variety of severe and ongoing health effects owing to oil exposure. Virtually all of the heavily oiled salt marsh habitat was in Louisiana, with the majority occurring in Barataria Bay. Multispecies trawl survey abundances declined post-DWH throughout eastern coastal Louisiana but remained stable elsewhere. A regime shift in composition of Barataria Bay trawl survey catches occurred during and following the spill, the persistence of which was associated with long-term reductions in average salinity and increases in water clarity. In some cases, fishery closures were associated with measurable but ephemeral increases in abundance of some targeted and bycatch species. Freshwater flooding of marshes was ineffective in preventing coastal oiling and severely affected benthic euryhaline resources including Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and Marsh Periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata). The flooding response measure experiment also indicates the directionality of impacts that further planned water diversions may have on ecological communities of lower Mississippi River basins.

TI  - Can the Non-native Salt Marsh Halophyte Spartina alterniflora Threaten Native Seagrass (Zostera japonica) Habitats? A Case Study in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are critical ecosystems, and they are among the most threatened habitats on the planet. As an anthropogenic biotic invader, Spartina alterniflora Loisel. competes with native plants, threatens native ecosystems and coastal aquaculture, and may cause local biodiversity to decline. The distribution area of the exotic species S. alterniflora in the Yellow River Delta had been expanding to ca.4,000 ha from 1990 to 2018. In this study, we reported, for the first time, the competitive effects of the exotic plant (S. alterniflora) on seagrass (Zostera japonica Asch. & Graebn.) by field investigation and a transplant experiment in the Yellow River Delta. Within the first 3 months of the field experiment, S. alterniflora had pushed forward 14 m into the Z. japonica distribution region. In the study region, the area of S. alterniflora in 2019 increased by 516 times compared with its initial area in 2015. Inhibition of Z. japonica growth increased with the invasion of S. alterniflora. Z. japonica had been degrading significantly under the pressure of S. alterniflora invasion. S. alterniflora propagates sexually via seeds for long distance invasion and asexually by tillers and rhizomes for short distance invasion. Our results describe the invasion pattern of S. alterniflora and can be used to develop strategies for prevention and control of S. alterniflora invasion.

AB  - Potential rates of aerobic respiration, denitrification, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were investigated in 10 different wetland soils with a wide range of biogeochemical characteristics, with the objective of determining relationships between process rates and soil properties. Electron acceptor amendments to methanogenic soils caused gradual (1-13 d) to immediate transitions in electron flow from methanogenesis to alternate electron accepters. Rates of organic C mineralization ranged between 0.2 and 34 mu mol C g(-1) d(-1) and averaged three times faster with O-2 as compared to alternate electron accepters. There was no significant difference between rates of organic C mineralization (CO2 + CH4 production) under denitrifying, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions, indicating that soil organic carbon availability was similar under the different anaerobic conditions. Rates of electron acceptor consumption ranged between 1 and 107 mu mol g(-1) d-1 for O-2, 0.5 and 9.3 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) for NO3-, 0.1 and 11.1 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) for SO42- and 0.1 and 6.2 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) for CO2. Heterotrophic potentials in wetland soils were strongly correlated with inorganic N and several available C indices (total, dissolved and microbial C), but not with pH or dissolved nutrients (P, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe(II)). Microbial activity-soil property relationships determined in this study may be useful for predicting the fate of pollutants that are influenced by microbial oxidation-reduction reactions in different types of wetland soils.

T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise is expected to push saline waters into previously fresher regions of estuaries, and higher salinities may expose oligohaline marshes to invertebrate herbivores typically constrained by salinity. The smooth cordgrass,Spartina alterniflora(syn.Sporobolus alterniflorus), can defend itself against herbivores in polyhaline marshes, however it is not known ifS. alterniflora's defense varies along the mesohaline to oligohaline marsh gradient in estuaries. I found thatS. alterniflorafrom a mesohaline marsh is better defended than plants from an oligohaline marsh, supporting the optimal defense theory. Higher salinity treatments lowered carbon content, C:N, and new stem biomass production, traits associated with a tolerance strategy, suggesting that salinity may mediate the defense response ofS. alterniflora. Further, simulated herbivory increased the nitrogen content and decreased C:N ofS. alterniflora. This indicates that grazing may increaseS. alterniflorasusceptibility to future herbivory via improved forage quality. Simulated herbivory also decreased both belowground and new stem biomass production, highlighting a potential pathway in which herbivory can indirectly facilitate marsh loss, asS. alterniflorabiomass is critical for vertical accretion and marsh stability under future sea level rise scenarios.

TI  - Effect of octenol on engorgement by Tabanus nigrovittatus (Diptera : Tabanidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adult female Tabanus nigrovittatus Macquart (Diptera: Tabanidae) were field collected from a salt marsh in Essex County, Massachusetts. The horse flies were transported back to and tested in the laboratory to determine the effects of octenol (1-octen-3-ol) on engorgement. Flies exposed to octenol strips had a significantly higher engorgement response compared with control flies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an important link between an odor stimulus and the feeding response in Tabanidae. Research examining the link between odor attractants and repellents on the engorgement response is lacking or limited in most hernatopbagous Diptera. Understanding the role odors have on ingestion is essential to knowing how to interrupt feeding behavior of blood-feeding arthropods, especially for important vectors.

TI  - Comparison of selenium and sulfur volatilization by dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DMSP) in two marine bacteria and estuarine sediments
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The volatile forms of selenium emitted from soils and plants have been identified by others as dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide. Dimethylselenoniopropionate, a possible precursor of dimethylselenide, is the selenium analogue of the common marine osmoprotectant, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Dimethylselenoniopropionate was organically synthesized from dimethylselenide and acrylate and used in a comparative study with dimethylsulfoniopropionate as a growth substrate, an inducer and substrate for dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in two marine bacterial isolates, Alcaligenes sp. strain M3A and Pseudomonas doudoroffii, and in salt marsh sediments and estuarine creek water samples. In P. doudoroffii, the rate of dimethylselenoniopropionate transport into cells was about half that observed with dimethylsulfoniopropionate; Alcaligenes does not take up these molecules. The rate and extent of induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in P. doudoroffii at low concentrations of dimethylselenoniopropionate were similar to that of dimethylsulfoniopropionate. In Alcaligenes the low constitutive level of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase cleaved dimethylselenoniopropionate into dimethylselenide and acrylate, but induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase by dimethylselenoniopropionate did not follow. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyases from both strains, when induced by dimethylsulfoniopropionate, utilized dimethylselenoniopropionate as a substrate with emission of dimethylselenide. Rates of partially purified dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity with dimethylselenoniopropionate were half those with dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Anoxic salt marsh sediments catalyzed dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylselenoniopropionate degradation at equal rates. In sediments containing high organic matter, both dimethylsulfide and dimethylselenide served as substrates for methanogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that organic selenium molecules can be volatilized by the same biochemical pathways as organic sulfur molecules.

TI  - Stable isotopes and oceanographic modeling reveal spatial and trophic connectivity among terrestrial, estuarine, and marine environments
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous sources provides energy and nutrients to nearshore food webs including filter-feeding bivalves. In Puget Sound, Washington, USA, the degree to which shellfish rely on these different organic matter subsidies may be important for their management and that of nearshore food webs in general. We explored patterns of terrestrial-marine connectivity in a large, temperate estuary using a combination of oceanographic modeling and isotopic mixing models. We first examined spatial connectivity by modeling freshwater contributions of the major river basins to Puget Sound (potential connectivity), then estimated the relative contribution of terrestrial, nearshore, and marine organic matter sources to nearshore particulate organic matter (POM) (actual connectivity) and to the diets of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (realized connectivity). To estimate actual and realized connectivity, we analyzed the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of oyster tissue, POM, and primary producers from intertidal, offshore, salt marsh, and upland habitats across the dry (summer) and wet (fall-winter) seasons. Mixing models indicated that both oyster bed POM and oyster diets were composed largely of intertidal macrophytes and salt marsh plants, with less important contributions of phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, and upland vegetation. Our findings suggest that oyster production may be driven more by coastal and marine primary production than by riverine sources, even in a fjord subject to strong freshwater influences.

TI  - Succession of macrofaunal communities and environmental properties along a gradient of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora invasion stages
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic species smooth cordgrass (Spartina alternifiora) is recognized as an important invasive species in China, introduced about 40 years ago. The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis. The succession of macrofaunal communities should be considered as a comprehensive response to the variations on environmental properties co-varying with smooth cordgrass invasion in coastal wetlands.

TI  - A plug flow-through reactor for studying biogeochemical reactions in undisturbed aquatic sediments
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A slow flow, plug-through reactor was developed for measuring equilibrium and kinetic parameters of biogeochemical reactions on intact sections of sediment cores. The experimental approach was designed to preserve the structural, geochemical and microbiological integrity of the sediment sections and, hence, retrieve reaction parameters that apply to in-situ conditions.Inert tracer breakthrough experiments were performed on a variety of unconsolidated surface sediments from lacustrine, estuarine and marine depositional environments. The sediments studied cover wide ranges of composition, porosity (46-83%) and mean grain size (10(-4)-10(-2) cm). Longitudinal dispersion coefficients were determined from the breakthrough curves of Br-. The curves were also used to check for early breakthrough or trailing, that is, features indicative of non-ideal flow conditions. Sediment plugs that exhibited these features were eliminated from further experiments.Dimensionless equilibrium adsorption coefficients (K) of NH4+, were calculated from measured retardation times between the breakthrough of NH4+ and Br-. The values of K at 5 degrees C vary between 0.3 and 2.3, with the highest value obtained in a fine-grained marine sediment, the lowest in a coarse-grained lake sediment. The values for the marine and estuarine sediments agree with values reported in the literature. The dependencies of K on ionic strength (range 0.2-0.7 m) and temperature (range 5-25 degrees C) in an estuarine sediment confirm that the main sorption mechanism for NH4+ is ion exchange.The reactor was used in recirculation mode to measure steady-state rates of dissimilatory SO42- reduction in a salt-marsh sediment. Recirculation homogenizes solute concentrations within the reactor, hence facilitating the derivation of reaction rate expressions that depend on solution composition. The rate of microbial SO(4)(2-)reduction was found to be nearly independent of the dissolved SO42- concentration in the range of 2.2-1 mM. Fitting of the experimental rates to a Monod relationship resulted in a maximum estimate of the half-saturation concentration, K-s, of 240 mu M. This value is comparable to those reported for a pure culture of SO42--reducing bacteria, but is significantly smaller than the only other K-s value reported in the literature for SO42- utilization in a natural marine sediment.

TI  - Peptide decomposition by extracellular hydrolysis in coastal seawater and salt marsh sediment
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracellular peptide hydrolysis rates were measured in seawater and sediment from Flax Pond salt marsh using peptide analogs (LYA-peptides) as substrates. This technique allows the direct measurement of specific hydrolysis products and thus provides insights into enzymatic hydrolysis pathways. In sediments, hydrolysis rate constants of LYA-peptides varied seasonally and with depth. Highest activity was found in spring and summer, and most cores exhibited a subsurface maximum. Calculations using the concentrations of chemically-measured peptides suggested that extracellular hydrolysis of peptides is faster than the rate of free amino acids uptake. However, not all peptides may be available for enzymatic hydrolysis. In both seawater and sediment, extracellular hydrolysis of peptides of up to 8 amino acids yielded smaller peptides and free amino acids. Hydrolysis rates depended on size of the peptide substrate, although a clear relationship with number of amino acid constituents was not evident. Peptides containing > 2 amino acids were hydrolyzed 10-400 times faster than dipeptides or the fluorogenic substrate Leucine-MCA. Thus, dipeptidases are either uncommon in nature, or hydrolysis is carried out by nonspecific hydrolases that with a low affinity for dipeptides. This is also suggested by the presence of a lag time before dipeptide hydrolysis begins, and the absence of dipeptide hydrolysis in 0.2-mu m-filtered. One implication of this finding is that measurements of hydrolysis rates using substrates like Leu-MCA may not accurately predict the magnitude of hydrolysis rates of macromolecules in the marine environment. Even though dipeptide hydrolysis is slow compared to that of larger peptides, LYA-dipeptides are preferentially produced from the hydrolysis of larger substrates. LYA-dipeptides do not penetrate cell membranes of microorganism because of their size, but natural dipeptides are smaller and can be transported across the cell membrane. Since dipeptides do not appear to accumulate in natural waters, they must be rapidly removed by microorganisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vulnerability of the peatland carbon sink to sea-level rise
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater peatlands are carbon accumulating ecosystems where primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition rates in the soil, and therefore perform an important sink function in global carbon cycling. Typical peatland plant and microbial communities are adapted to the waterlogged, often acidic and low nutrient conditions that characterise them. Peatlands in coastal locations receive inputs of oceanic base cations that shift conditions from the environmental optimum of these communities altering the carbon balance. Blanket bogs are one such type of peatlands occurring in hyperoceanic regions. Using a blanket bog to coastal marsh transect in Northwest Scotland we assess the impacts of salt intrusion on carbon accumulation rates. A threshold concentration of salt input, caused by inundation, exists corresponding to rapid acidophilic to halophilic plant community change and a carbon accumulation decline. For the first time, we map areas of blanket bog vulnerable to sea-level rise, estimating that this equates to similar to 7.4% of the total extent and a 0.22 Tg yr(-1) carbon sink. Globally, tropical peatlands face the proportionally greatest risk with similar to 61,000 km(2) (similar to 16.6% of total) lying <= 5 m elevation. In total an estimated 20.2 +/- 2.5 GtC is stored in peatlands <= 5 m above sea level, which are potentially vulnerable to inundation.

TI  - Enrichment of salt-tolerant CO2-fixing communities in microbial electrosynthesis systems using porous ceramic hollow tube wrapped with carbon cloth as cathode and for CO2 supply
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial inocula from marine origins are less explored for CO2 reduction in microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system, although effective CO2-fixing communities in marine environments are well-documented. We explored natural saline habitats, mainly salt marsh (SM) and mangrove (M) sediments, as potential inoculum sources for enriching salt-tolerant CO2 reducing community using two enrichment strategies: H-2:CO2 (80:20) enrichment in serum vials and enrichment in cathode chamber of MES reactors operated at -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Porous ceramic hollow tube wrapped with carbon cloth was used as cathode and for direct CO2 delivery to CO2 reducing communities growing on the cathode surface. Methanogenesis was dominant in both the M- and SM-seeded MES and the methanogenic Archaea Methanococcus was the most dominant genus. Methane production was slightly higher in the SM-seeded MES (4.9 +/- 1.7 mmol) compared to the M-seeded MES (3.8 +/- 1.1 mmol). In contrast, acetate production was almost two times higher in the M-seeded MES (3.1 +/- 0.9 mmol) than SM-seeded MES (1.5 +/- 13 mmol). The high relative abundance of the genus Acetobacterium in the M-seeded serum vials correlates with the high acetate production obtained. The different enrichment strategies affected the community composition, though the communities in MES reactors and serum vials were performing similar functions methanogenesis and acetogenesis). Despite similar operating conditions, the microbial community composition of M-seeded serum vials and MES reactors differed from the SM-seeded serum vials and MES reactors, supporting the importance of inoculum source in the evolution of CO2-reducing microbial communities.

TI  - Impact of prolonged rice cultivation on coupling relationship among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria over a 1000-year paddy soil chronosequence
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term soil chronosequences are valuable model systems for investigating pedogenesis and investigating the process of element coupling. Here, we assessed the coupling relationships among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria (Anaeromyxobacter, Geobacter, and Shewanella) in a paddy soil chronosequence of approximately 50 to 1000years. Soils of the chronosequence originated from tidal marsh under nearly identical landscape and climate conditions. During 1000years of rice cultivation, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in surface horizons (0-20cm) increased from 10.4 to 21.8gkg(-1). In contrast, total Fe contents declined from 59.6 to 45.1gkg(-1) during the initial 50years of paddy rice cultivation and then further decreased at a low rate of 0.004gkg(-1) soil year(-1) (equivalent to 10kgha(-1) soil year(-1)). Organically complexed Fe oxides (Fe-p) increased from 219 to 642mgg(-1) with increasing time of pedogenesis, but free total Fe oxides (Fe-d) and amorphous Fe oxides (Fe-o) declined at early stage of soil development, followed by a slow accumulation at later stages of the chronosequence. Gene copy numbers of Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter increased from 4.6x10(5) and 3.6x10(6) copies g(-1) to 3.8x10(7) and 3.6x10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil with continuous paddy rice cultivation, while concurrently Shewanella gene abundance decreased gradually from 4.5x10(5) to 9.3x10(4) copies g(-1) dry soil. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), different coupling relationships were observed among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria for the first 300years of paddy chronosequence and thereafter. Overall, all Fe-reducing bacteria did not show consistent variation. With the stable microbial community and iron oxide fractions, the microbially mediated dissimilatory coupling relationship between C and Fe becomes simple during 1000years of paddy soil development.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Fluxes Vary Between Phragmites Australis and Native Vegetation Zones in Coastal Wetlands Along a Salinity Gradient
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of native species by invasive Phragmites australis in coastal wetlands may impact ecosystem processes including fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To investigate differences in daytime CH4 and CO2 fluxes as well as vegetation properties between Phragmites and native vegetation zones along a salinity gradient, fluxes were measured via cavity ringdown spectroscopy in 3 New England coastal marshes, ranging from oligohaline to polyhaline. While daytime CH4 emissions decreased predictably with increasing soil salinity, those from Phragmites zones were larger (15 to 1254 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) than those from native vegetation (4-484 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) across the salinity gradient. Phragmites zones displayed greater daytime CO2 uptake than native vegetation zones (-7 to -15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) vs. -2 to 0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at mesohaline-polyhaline, but not oligohaline, sites. Results suggest that vegetation zone and salinity both impact net emission or uptake of daytime CO2 and CH4 (respectively). Future research is warranted to demonstrate Phragmites-mediated impacts on GHG fluxes, and additional measurements across seasonal and diel cycles will enable a more complete understanding of Phragmites' net impact on marsh radiative forcing.

TI  - Empirical relationship between specific leaf area and thermal dissipation of Phragmites australis in salt marshes of Qinwangchuan
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The correlation between specific leaf area (SLA) and thermal dissipation reflects not only the accumulation and dissipation of plant photosynthesis, but also plants' adaptation to their habitats and changing environment. The objective of this study is to examine the correlation between SLA and thermal dissipation of reed (Phragmites australis) under different soil moisture conditions and salt contents.Methods Our study site was located in the National Wetland Park in Qinwangchuan, Gansu Province, China. Our sampling site extends from the edge to the central of a salt marsh where the reed was the single dominant species. The study site was divided into three zones based on the distance from the water. Within each zone, six 2 m x 2 m sampling plots were randomly located to select six reed individuals in each plot (total = 18). Vegetation height, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and soil electrical conductivity (EC) were measured, with the six reed individuals taken to the laboratory to measure leaf thickness. Leaf net photosynthetic rate (P.), transpiration rate (Tr), and other parameters of the reeds were also measured in each plot prior to harvesting. Quantitative measures of chlorophyll fluorescence were taken after 30-min dark adaptation. Quadrat survey method was used to model the empirical relationship between the transpiration rate and leaf characteristics.Important findings Vegetation height and aboveground biomass increased with soil moisture content, but EC and photosynthetically active radiation decreased. Leaf area, T. and Pn increased along the gradient, leaf thickness showed decreasing, but the increasing trend of SLA switched to a decreasing trend, while leaf dry mass presented an opposite trend. From plot I to III, the quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation (Y(NP Q)) and non-photochemical quenching decreased, the actual photochemical efficiency of PSII and photochemical quenching increased, and quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation increased before decreasing. There appeared a highly significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) between SLA and Y(NPQ) at plot I and III, and a less significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) at plot II. Along the soil moisture gradient, reed seemed using light effectively by changing leaf thermal dissipation through adjusting their leaf size and SLA-A potential self-protection mechanism in light of adapting the habitat.

TI  - Plutonium solubility in sediment pore waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using in situ porous cup samplers, dissolved Pu concentrations have been measured over a year in the pore waters from two contrasting sites in the valley of the River Esk, North West England. In saltmarsh sediments, dissolved Pu represents approximately 1 part in 10(6) of the total inventory. The Pu concentration in solution is in the range 1.1-3.5 mBq l(-1), varying by a factor of 3 in the course of the year. Most of the changes in dissolved Pu coincide with changes in dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations, with Pu being low in the summer months when Fe and Mn are high. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors which make it unclear as to whether these patterns might be related to seasonal redox changes in the saltmarsh. At the highly organic, reducing reedbed site, the proportion of Pu in solution is typically around 1 part in 10(3), proportionately much higher than in the saltmarsh, giving concentrations ranging between 9.0 and 28.5 mBq l(-1), and are apparently maintained by complexation to dissolved organic matter. There is no obvious seasonal pattern at the reedbed site nor is there any relation to any of the dissolved species measured (Fe, Mn, Na, DOG). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Direct and Indirect Interactions Between Lower Estuarine Mangrove and Saltmarsh Habitats and a Commercially Important Penaeid Shrimp
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetated habitats in estuaries may provide a structural refuge and food supply in the same place, but benefits are also derived where a productive food source and suitable habitat are adjacent to each other. Quantifying these relationships is fundamental to understanding the structural and functional characteristics of estuarine ecosystems and for informing management actions. Effective juvenile habitat (habitat that contributes greater-than-average numbers of recruits to the adult population), recruitment patterns and trophic relationships were studied for Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus plebejus) in the lower Clarence River estuary, New South Wales, between 2014 and 2016. Effective juvenile habitat was identified in both the north arm and main river channel of the estuary, and these areas also supported a higher abundance of juvenile prawns. There was minimal recruitment to the southern channels of the estuary, possibly due to reduced connectivity with the incoming tide arising from a rock wall. Trophic relationships in parts of the lower estuary were evaluated using stable isotopes, and saltmarsh grass (Sporobolus virginicus) was the dominant primary producer supporting juvenile Eastern King Prawn productivity across the area. Mangroves were of minimal importance, and seagrass cover was minimal in the area studied. The patterns observed indicate that nursery function of different areas within the lower estuary is a product of connectivity, recruitment and nutrition derived from primary productivity of vascular plants. Habitats within the lower Clarence River estuary have seen substantial degradation over decadal time scales, and the implications of our findings for targeting future habitat repair are discussed.

TI  - The grazing effects of grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, on epiphytic microalgae associated with Spartina alterniflora
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Experiments were performed seasonally to estimate grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, grazing on the epiphytic microalgae of cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and to determine if grass shrimp have the potential to regulate epiphyte abundance. Grass shrimp were given access to live culms with low and high epiphytic abundance and standing-dead culms collected from the streamside levee of a Louisiana salt marsh. Plexiglas frames were used to hold calms upright in aquaria and to restrict grass shrimp access to one half of each culm. We compared epiphyte biomass on the sides of culms exposed to shrimp with the corresponding unexposed sides. Epiphytes were removed from the lowest 10 cm. of culms on days 0, 3, and 10, and chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements on each culm half were made by fluorometry. Chl a biomass on culm halves not exposed to grass shrimp significantly increased over time. Percent reductions in chl a on culm halves exposed to grass shrimp (calculated by subtraction from the corresponding half not exposed to shrimp) significantly increased over time for at least one culm type in all seasons. Grass shrimp caused an average 30% reduction of epiphyte biomass over 3 d and a 40% reduction over 10 d, suggesting that grass shrimp have the capability of consuming a substantial proportion of the daily production of epiphytes. Epiphytes from standing-dead culms may be more important than those from live culms at the marsh edge to the diet of grass shrimp because chl a biomass was, on average, high, and standing-dead culms were seasonally abundant. Diagnostic photosynthetic pigments from selected culms, grass shrimp gut contents, and fecal pellets were identified by high performance liquid chromatography and were used to quantify the taxonomic groups of epiphytic microalgae. Results suggested that diatoms, brown algae, green algae, red algae, and cyanobacteria were present on all culms. Similarities in the pigment content of grass shrimp gut contents and fecal pellets suggested that all algal groups were ingested. Pigment data analysis could not detect a change in the composition of the microalgal assemblage associated with grass shrimp grazing. Assuming that the reduction in chl a was due exclusively to grazing, grass shrimp consumed an average of 0.5-1.5 g epiphyte carbon shrimp(-1) d(-1), suggesting that grass shrimp benefit significantly from the consumption of S. alterniflora epiphytic algae.

AB  - An energy flow network was constructed for the Kromme estuary, South Africa. Extensive data, collected on this estuary, were used to calculate the energetics of each of the 27 compartments identified in this system. The model consists of three non-living and 24 living compartments. The non-living compartments were dissolved organic carbon (DOG), suspended and sediment particulate organic carbon (POC), while the living compartments consisted of four plant groups, three bacterial groups and 17 animal groups. The animals range from meiofauna to macrofauna and fish. Biomass of all compartments were estimated in mg C m(-2) and exchanges in mg C m(-2) day(-1). It was found that the main primary producers are the marsh halophytes and macrophytes. It seems that although the salt marshes cover only 38% of the Kromme estuary, the marsh halophytes contribute 78% of the total primary production, making it the most important producer in this estuary. Less than 10% of the halophyte production enters the grazing food-chain, with the remainder being broken down to sediment detritus. This indicates that the sediment detritus, as well as the animals that feed on it, forms the most important part of this food-web. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

TI  - Distribution and nutrient status of Haplotypes of the marsh grass Phragmites australis along the Rappahannock River in Virginia
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the distribution and nutrient status of native haplotype F of Phragmites australis along the freshwater to mesohaline tidal marsh gradient of the Rappahannock River, Virginia, for comparison with the normative, invasive haplotype M. Using GIS analysis of aerial photography and GPS-based ground truthing, we identified 55 separate clones of native haplotype F comprising a total of 3.68 ha (range 0.002-0.734 ha), all found in tidal wetlands where surface water salinity was 0 psu. We identified 219 separate clones of the invasive haplotype M covering 68.3 ha along the same stretch of river (range 0.004-11.86 ha), found in wetlands where salinity ranged from 0 to I I psu. From 15 separate clones for each haplotype, average carbon content in leaves of the native was significantly higher than the invasive (43.90 +/- 0.08% versus 42.82 +/- 0.15%, F-1,F-28 = 20.938, p < 0.01), and nitrogen content was significantly lower (2.22 +/- 0.03% versus 2.58 +/- 0.07%, 171,21 11.972, p < 0.01). The average C:N:P ratio for leaf tissue was 1100:48:1 for haplotype F and 1084:56:1 for haplotype M. Relative to the native, the invasive haplotype forms larger stands distributed throughout a broader estuarine reach and incorporates more nitrogen in leaf tissue. From a management standpoint, native Phragmites protection should focus on deterring normative haplotype invasion through the minimization of both adjacent upland disturbance and nutrient enrichment in tidal freshwater marshes.

TI  - Short organic carbon turnover time and narrow C-14 age spectra in early Holocene wetland paleosols
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Paleosols contain information about the rates of soil organic carbon turnover when the soil was actively forming. However, this temporal information is often difficult to interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C-14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C-14 age spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C-14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C-14 ages within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C-14 ages from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C-14 ages from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<<300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C-14 age of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C-14 ages also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise.

TI  - Body size, trophic position, and the coupling of different energy pathways across a saltmarsh landscape
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Body size is considered an important structuring mechanism of food webs because consumers are usually larger and more mobile than their prey and may couple energy among habitats. We explored the links among trophic position (TP), body size, and the coupling of different energy channels (phytoplankton and C4-marsh plants) in a saltmarsh landscape in the northern Gulf of Mexico-a dynamic system considered weakly shaped by biotic interactions. Body size was positively associated with TP, and this relationship was stronger in the phytoplankton pathway vs. the C4-marsh pathway. There was a gradual increase in the coupling of phytoplankton and C4-marsh plants at larger body sizes and higher TP. Phytoplankton supported longer food chains and larger body sizes than C4-marsh plants. Results support predictions of the landscape theory for food web architecture and indicate that the role of body size in determining trophic interactions may vary across food web compartments.

AB  - During 2004, 10 samplings were performed in order to measure dissolved methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the surface waters of Rio San Pedro, a tidal creek in the salt marsh area of the Bay of Cadiz (SW Spain). The inner partvs of the creek is affected by the inputs coming from an intensive fish farm and the drainage of an extensive salt marsh area.Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O concentrations ranged from 11 to 88 nM, 36 to 108 mu M and 14 to 50 nM, respectively. Surface waters were in all cases oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere, reaching values of up to 5000% for CH4, 1240% for CO2 and 840% for N2O. Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O showed a significant tidal and seasonal variability. Over a tidal cycle, concentrations were always highest during low tide, which points to the influence of the inputs from the fish farm effluent and the drainage of the adjacent salt marsh area, as well as in situ production within the system. Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O seasonal patterns were similar and showed maximum concentrations in summer conditions.

TI  - IsoCaRB: A novel bioreactor system to characterize the lability and natural carbon isotopic (C-14, C-13) signatures of microbially respired organic matter
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter is the dominant pool of reduced carbon in marine and freshwater systems. Mineralization of organic matter is largely attributed to complex and diverse microbial communities that mediate degradation and ultimately yield the terminal respiratory product, carbon dioxide (CO2). The factors that constrain the lability and degradation of organic matter remain unclear, but they involve a complex interplay between structural and chemical properties of the compounds, physical properties of the matrices, and the functional potential of the microorganisms that are present. To investigate these relationships, we developed a novel bioreactor system-called Isotopic Carbon Respirometer-Bioreactor (IsoCaRB)-that permits real-time monitoring of microbial CO2 production rates and collects sequential samples of this CO2 for off-line isotopic analyses (C-13, C-14). Application of this system to organic-rich sediments from Salt Pond, MA reveals that organic matter is oxidized both abiotically and microbially, and that the pattern of microbial respiration by the native sediment community is complex, accessing different carbon substrates over the course of incubation. Isotopic measurements show modern organic matter of progressively older ages (<= ca. 50 yr) is consumed, and this material has variable origins (salt marsh grasses, terrestrial, and marine organic matter). Collectively, the IsoCaRB system provides coupled insights into the sources, ages, and inherent biological and abiotic reactivity of natural organic matter.

TI  - Development and application of tidal creek ecosystem models
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal creek ecosystems integrate the coastal landscape by linking upland environments to the coastal ocean. These ecosystems feature a combination of sinuous creek beds with wide lateral wetlands interspersed with mud flats and oyster reefs. Previous studies demonstrated negative relationships between habitat quality and indicators of watershed urbanization. However, predicting trends in ecological robustness for a number of irregularly branched tidal ecosystems with different watershed attributes, material inputs, and flushing is a difficult task. This study began to address this task by using a simulation framework to assess water column and sediment ecological processes in two distinct tidal creek ecosystems in South Carolina (Malind Creek versus Okatee Creek). Biogeochemical cycling in these creeks fluctuates with hourly, daily, and seasonal changes in tidal exchange, freshwater and material inputs, and autochthonous primary production. Over 2 years simulation based on 2001-2002 input data an estimated 4-5 times more freshwater entered Okatee Creek than Malind Creek even though Okatee Creek watershed and basin areas are only 2.5X larger. Phytoplankton consumed approximately 70% of all water column dissolved nitrogen annually with autochthonous production the primary source of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (OC) to the sediments. Okatee Creek had approximately 7X the net deposition of OC to the sediments were it combined with sediment microalgal biomass to drive benthic secondary production. Differences in physical transport in salt marsh dominated tidal creeks influence the capacity to process, transform, and sequester introduced materials. Modifications to the simulation model will include improved depth, volume, and tidal exchange for more realistic prediction of effective concentrations. This modeling framework connects watershed and atmospheric material loading to estuarine productivity has been used to assess differences in ecosystem metabolism with changes in environmental drivers, and provides the foundation for a suite of sub-models to forecast the potential effects of relative sea level rise for a variety of nearshore environments.

TI  - Evaluation of nekton use and habitat characteristics of restored Louisiana marsh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh terracing and coconut fiber mats are two wetland restoration techniques implemented at Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, USA. Using nekton as an indicator of habitat quality, nekton community assemblages were compared between terraced, coconut-matted, unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), and open water (pre-restoration) habitats. Using a throw trap and a 3 m x 2 m straight seine, 192 nekton samples were collected over four dates in 2001 and 2002 at all habitats. Nekton abundance was similar at unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), coconut mat, and terrace edge, and significantly higher than at open water (pre-restoration) sites (P < 0.05). Coconut-matted habitat and unmanaged marsh edges had significantly higher numbers of benthic dependent species than terrace edges (P < 0.05), potentially because of differences in substrate. Terraced sites had lower organic matter and siltier substrate as compared to unmanaged marsh sites. At Sabine NWR, terracing increased nekton use as compared to pre-restoration conditions (open water samples) by providing marsh edge habitat, but failed to support a nekton community similar to unmanaged marsh (restoration goals) or coconut-matted sites. Future restoration projects may evaluate the combined use of coconut mats with terracing projects in order to enhance habitat for benthic dependent nekton. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Lateral Marsh Edge Erosion as a Source of Sediments for Vertical Marsh Accretion
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With sea level rise accelerating and sediment inputs to the coast declining worldwide, there is concern that tidal wetlands will drown. To better understand this concern, sources of sediment contributing to marsh elevation gain were computed for Plum Island Sound estuary, MA, USA. We quantified input of sediment from rivers and erosion of marsh edges. Maintaining elevation relative to the recent sea level rise rate of 2.8 mm yr(-1) requires input of 32,299 MT yr(-1) of sediment. The input from watersheds is only 3,210 MT yr(-1). Marsh edge erosion, based on a comparison of 2005 and 2011 LiDAR data, provides 10,032 MT yr(-1). This level of erosion is met by <0.1% of total marsh area eroded annually. Mass balance suggests that 19,070 MT yr(-1) should be of tidal flat or oceanic origin. The estuarine distribution of C-14 and C-13 isotopes of suspended particulate organic carbon confirms the resuspension of ancient marsh peat from marsh edge erosion, and the vertical distribution of C-14-humin material in marsh sediment is indicative of the deposition of ancient organic carbon on the marsh platform. High resuspension rates in the estuarine water column are sufficient to meet marsh accretionary needs. Marsh edge erosion provides an important fraction of the material needed for marsh accretion. Because of limited sediment supply and sea level rise, the marsh platform maintains elevation at the expense of total marsh area.Plain Language Summary Tidal marshes in the Plum Island Sound estuary have been gaining elevation over the past 100 years at about the same rate as sea level rise (SLR), but there is concern that they will drown and disappear if rates of SLR increase substantially due to CO2 emissions and climate change. What are the sediment sources enabling elevation gain? Rivers were not the primary source, providing less than 10% of elevation gain needs. Marsh edge erosion is much more important-providing over 30% of needs. We estimate that the remainder comes from the ocean or erosion of tidal flats. If the ocean is a major source, these marshes might be able to maintain elevation throughout the 21st century even if SLR greatly accelerates. However, if erosion of tidal flats is the primary source of sediments, the future outlook is less favorable because the more tidal flat erosion increases, the more edge erosion will also increase. The net result will be a loss of marsh area in this system. The dynamics we found for Plum Island Sound are likely to be occurring globally, as declining sediment inputs from rivers, and increasing rates of SLR due to climate change are worldwide phenomenon. Loss of marshes will have a major impact on the resilience of coastal communities landward of the marshes and the productivity of most coastal fisheries.

TI  - Emergence of nutrient-cycling feedbacks related to plant size and invasion success in a wetland community-ecosystem model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plants in wetlands may alter community composition through complex interactions related to elevated N inflows, plant size, litter production, and ecosystem N retention and recycling. To investigate these interactions, we constructed an individual-based model, MONDRIAN, that integrates individual growth and clonal reproduction, nutrient competitive interactions among species, and ecosystem processes. We conducted in silico experiments, parameterized for Great Lakes coastal marshes, where invaders that differed only in size attempted to invade native communities across a range of N inflows. Small invaders were able to persist only at low N inflow and never dominated. Large invaders were not able to reproduce clonally at low N inflow but they successfully coexisted with natives at intermediate N inflow and dominated at high N inflow, excluding natives in some cases. In both native and invaded communities, a positive feedback in plant-detritus N cycling emerged, amplifying ecosystem N cycling to nearly 2x the range of N inflows. The largest invaders augmented this N-cycling feedback over the native community by up to 23%, increasing with greater N inflow, driving community NPP higher than the native community by 33% and litter mass higher by 35%. In communities dominated by the largest invader, wetland N retention was increased but species diversity decreased. Results demonstrate that a single trait difference, plant size, simultaneously allows natives to resist invasion at low N inflows and allows invaders to dominate at high N inflows, partly through augmenting ecosystem N-cycling feedbacks.

TI  - Response of Spartina patens to dissolved inorganic nutrient additions in the field
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide a buffer between the terrestrial landscape and estuaries and may be important in preventing the movement of land-derived nutrients into coastal waters. We examined the response of S. patens in the field to additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and found significant (p < 0.05) positive N effects on aboveground biomass, leaf chlorophyll, tissue nutrient concentrations, and induction of fluorescence kinetics of chlorophyll a. Mean endomycorrhizal colonization among treatments was 22%, and fungal colonization ranged from 2% to 61% in the plots. We found no significant effect of N or P on endomycorrhizal colonization, but there was a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.66, p = 0.005) between the belowground biomass and fungal colonization. This study showed that S. patens could sequester 44-100% ofthe added N and 82-100% ofthe added P in its leaves, roots, and rhizomes. However, it is unclear how long-term nutrient overenrichment and the resulting changes in the S. patens-microbesediment system might alter the marsh buffering capacity.

TI  - An investigation into technetium binding in sediments
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal environments with reducing waters and/or sediments represent potential sinks for Tc-99 discharged to sea. Here, we have examined estuarine sediments from four geochemically distinct locations that have been exposed to Tc-99 discharged from Sellafield. Both the relative uptake and the operationally defined sediment "component" that holds the Tc were investigated in order to establish whether particular biogeochemical processes are predominately responsible for reducing and binding Tc in sediments. Despite the artefacts that can pose problems for sequential extractions, this scheme [Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem. 51 (1993) 1871 appears to be robust with regard to Tc. The results show that relative uptake of Tc varied greatly between the sites, with the highest occurring at an almost permanently anoxic fjord (Mariager Fjord, Denmark), followed by a brackish, seasonally eutrophic fjord (Roskilde Fjord, Denmark), then a sub-oxic salt marsh (which receives particle bound radionuclides from a more reducing mud patch; Esk Estuary, UK) and finally sulfidic and iron-reducing muddy sandy sediments (Needle's Eye, Solway Firth, Scotland). High relative uptake at the fjords was explained by the greater mixing of Tc-labelled oxic seawater into the part of the system where reduction of TcO4- was possible. Uptake at Mariager Fjord was higher than at Roskilde Fjord, reflecting the highly reducing geochemical conditions in the water body. Low uptake at Needle's Eye may be related to the speciation of technetium at this site as the sequential extraction data suggest that Tc is associated with the carbonate phase here. Tc carbonates are largely soluble, and this is the first observation of Tc association with carbonate fractions in the natural environment. The other three sites showed that organic matter, in conjunction with reducing conditions, was very important for binding and retaining Tc in sediments. The specific role of sulfides in controlling Tc retention in sediments was unclear because sulfides and organic matter are leached simultaneously in the sequential extraction scheme we applied, but there was evidence that Tc was not associated with acid-volatile iron monosulfides.

TI  - Mutual Interactions between Reduced Fe-Bearing Clay Minerals and Humic Acids under Dark, Oxygenated Conditions: Hydroxyl Radical Generation and Humic Acid Transformation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydroxyl radicals (OH) exert a strong impact on the carbon cycle due to their nonselective and highly oxidizing nature. Reduced iron-containing clay minerals (RIC) are one of the major contributors to the formation of center dot OH in dark environments, but their interactions with humic acids (HA) are poorly known. Here, we investigate the mutual interactions between RIC and HA under dark and oxygenated conditions. HA decreased the oxidation rate of structural Fe(II) in RIC but significantly promoted the center dot OH yield. HA dissolved a fraction of Fe(II) from RIC to form an aqueous Fe(II)-HA complex. center dot OH were generated through both heterogeneous (through oxidation of structural Fe(II)) and homogeneous pathways (through oxidation of aqueous Fe(II)-HA species). RIC-mediated center dot OH production by providing H2O2 to react with Fe(II)-HA and electrons to regenerate Fe(II)-HA. This highly efficient homogeneous pathway was responsible for increased center dot OH yield. Abundant center dot OH significantly decreased the molecular size, bleached chromophores, and increased the oxygen-containing functional groups of HA. These molecular changes of HA resembled photochemical transformation of HA. The mutual interaction between RIC and HA in dark and redox- fluctuating environments provides a new pathway for fast turnover of recalcitrant organic matters in clay- and HA-rich ecosystems such as tropical forest soils and tidal marsh sediments.

TI  - Effects of nutrient limitation, salinity increase, and associated stressors on mangrove forest cover, structure, and zonation across Indian Sundarbans
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic coastal activities and natural stressors aggravate degradation of small coastal patches of mangroves, which in turn destroy local resilience of mangrove forests in the Indian Sundar-bans, the continuous mangrove habitat that spans between India and Bangladesh. We conducted an analytical survey across 19 shoreline mangrove fringes spanning the Sundarbans, including both healthy and disturbed forests, and evaluated ninetyfive 60-cm composite sediment cores across a degradation and salinity gradient from similar to 4 to similar to 12 ppt. Increased salinity and anoxicity greatly inhibited nutrient cycling and release by microbial decomposers, subsequently resulting in nutrient-poor soil as a condition of degradation. Nutrient limitation, salinity rise, anoxicity increase, and sulfide build-up negatively controlled forest structure causing declines of forest coverage from similar to 98 to similar to 11%. In addition, the tide-dominated salinity gradient controlling species zonation was disrupted in disturbed forests with salinity-sensitive species gradually disappearing. An obvious change in species distribution is anticipated while salt-sensitive Heritiera fomes, Xylocarpus spp., and Phoenix paludosa failed to cope with increased salinity, evident by their absence from many forests. Excoecaria agallocha and Avicennia spp. acclimated well and expanded freely into degraded forests across the Sundarbans. Overall, our study strongly establishes salinity intrusion as primary mechanism for mangrove degradation.

TI  - Effects of nutrient loading on the carbon balance of coastal wetland sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of a 12-yr study in an oligotrophic South Carolina salt marsh demonstrate that soil respiration increased by 795 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and that carbon inventories decreased in sediments fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus. Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic matter in the top 5 cm of sediment was 475 g C m(-2) lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1). It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates that the increase in soil respiration was largely due to an increase in primary production. Sediment respiration in laboratory incubations also demonstrated positive effects of nutrients. Thus, the results indicate that increased nutrient loading of oligotrophic wetlands can lead to an increased rate of sediment carbon turnover and a net loss of carbon from sediments.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on surficial sediment samples, experiments of the trapping effect by vegetation on suspended particles, as well as measurements of changes in the sediment surface, this article deals mainly with general grain-size characteristics, the organic content of the sediments, the accretion rate in tidal marshes and the influence of the plant community along with the effect of benthic fauna on sedimentation. Conclusions that were reached included (a) mean grain-size M z (Phi) is between 3.0 and 8.5 under fair-weather conditions and can be as low as 2.5 in storm events, the grain-size composition is similar to the composition of the Yangtze River sediment; (b) a trend that the finer half of the sediment samples covers a wider grain-size range than the coarse half is shown by the fact that M z (Phi) >Phi(50) for 96% of the samples and SKr>0 for 97% of the samples; (c) positive correlation between M z and sigma(1) supports the observation that sediment sorting is functionally related to grain-size with the best sorting occurring at a median grain-size of 2.5 Phi-3.0 Phi. This fact corresponds to the theory that less energy is needed for the transport of fine sands (compared with both coarser and finer grains); (d) the organic content in surficial sediments is less than 1.5%. This low content of organic matter largely results from a high accretion rate of mineral grains from the river; (e) the grain-size of surficial sediment varies both temporally and spatially. The finest sediments occur in the centre of the marsh, becoming coarser peripherally. Around the island, the coarsest grain-size occurs on the seaside because of a higher water energy there. Grain-size in the main marsh is also influenced by seasonal changes in the plant community while the water energy especially during the storms has a large effect on the grain-size of the bare flats as well as on the outer area of the marsh; (f) accretion rates in marsh areas can be up to several decimeters. In this type of environment, the trapping effects of plants, as well as the biodeposition by benthic fauna, contribute very little to the total sedimentation. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

TI  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of aquatic and terrestrial plants of the San Francisco Bay estuarine system
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report measurements of seasonal variability in the C-N stable isotope ratios of plants collected across the habitat mosaic of San Francisco Bay, its marshes, and its tributary river system. Analyses of 868 plant samples were binned into 10 groups (e.g., terrestrial riparian, freshwater phytoplankton, salt marsh) to determine whether C-N isotopes can be used as biomarkers for tracing the origins of organic matter in this river-marsh-estuary complex. Variability of delta(130)C and delta(15)N was high (similar to5-10parts per thousand) within each plant group, and we identified three modes of variability: (1) between species and their microhabitats, (2) over annual cycles of plant growth and senescence, and (3) between living and decomposing biomass. These modes of within-group variability obscure any source-specific isotopic signatures, confounding the application of C-N isotopes for identifying the origins of organic matter. A second confounding factor was large dissimilarity between the delta(13)C-delta(15)N of primary producers and the organic-matter pools in the seston and sediments. Both confounding factors impede the application of C-N isotopes to reveal the food supply to primary consumers in ecosystems supporting diverse autotrophs and where the isotopic composition of organic matter has been transformed and become distinct from that of its parent plant sources. Our results support the advice of others: variability of C-N stable isotopes within all organic-matter pools is high and must be considered in applications of these isotopes to trace trophic linkages from primary producers to primary consumers. Isotope-based approaches are perhaps most powerful when used to complement other tools, such as molecular biomarkers, bioassays, direct measures of production, and compilations of organic-matter budgets.

TI  - Comparing Rhizon samplers and centrifugation for pore-water separation in studies of the marine carbonate system in sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate description of the carbonate system in pore waters is valuable in studies involving the degradation of sedimentary organic matter, recrystallization of calcium carbonate minerals, calculations of mineral saturation state, and cycling of ions affected by pH. Here, we analyze water chemistry of pore water extracted using centrifugation and Rhizon samplers from hemipelagic sediments in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, and a shallow salt marsh from Norfolk, England. In both study areas, the data are internally consistent for each pore-water separation technique, but the measured isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13([DIC])) differs between the two techniques. We performed laboratory experiments that show that both Rhizons and centrifugation are prone to degassing of CO2 enriched with C-12. We suggest that during sampling with Rhizons, air fills the voids left by extracted pore water; combined with the membrane's design to exclude air, some of the aqueous CO2 diffuses into these air bubbles instead of the sampler. Rhizons produce reliable calcium, strontium, manganese, and barium concentration data when soaked in deionized water and then flushed with the sample immediately prior to sampling. However, pore-water extractions with Rhizons are less reliable for analyses of pH and delta C-13([DIC]) Centrifugation produces reliable carbonate chemistry and major element data when tubes are fully filled without headspace and sealed tightly. Working in CO2 low/free atmosphere (e.g., N-2 glovebox) enhances the chance of losing CO2 from the sample in both sampling techniques due to increased negative gradient of CO2 between the core and its surrounding.

TI  - Soil chemical features as key predictors of plant community occurrence in a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling the relationships between soil chemical factors and vegetation in coastal areas provides a significant contribution to understanding the ecology and conservation of these ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin. The present study relates coastal plant communities and soil chemistry using multivariate analysis and generalized additive models (GAMs) in order (a) to determine the relationships between soil factors and plant community occurrence along a coastline-lagoon gradient; (b) to build best models of soil chemical predictors for coastal plant community occurrence. Distance from coastline was the primary driver of changes in plant community composition and soil factors on the Mediterranean coast. Field capacity, pH, CaCO3, NaCl and soil organic matter were the major parameters related to the pattern of vegetation distribution. Along the costaline-lagoon gradient, however, plant community and soil changes agreed for two main sequences of habitats. The first was in the sand dune environment, involving plant communities, the species composition of which varied in response to increasing soil development. The second was near lagoons, where vegetation responded to soil salinity, acting independently of other soil factors. Coastal plant community occurrence was explained by GAMs, using a few soil chemical predictors: pH and CaCO3 were the main predictors for dune communities but only partly explained their occurrence, whereas NaCl was the key factor for salt marsh community occurrence and largely contributed to the model. The results suggest that soil chemical changes can be detected through vegetation distribution, particularly in saline habitats. Thus, habitat-based models could be a useful tool to identify the key factors for different types of vegetation occurrence in coastal habitats. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Radiocarbon: A chronological tool for the recent past
T2  - QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The past few hundred years have seen large fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 concentration. In part, these have been the result of natural factors, including the climatic changes of the Little Ice Age, and the Sporer and Maunder solar activity minima. In addition, however, changes in human activity since the middle of the 19th century have released C-14-free CO2 to the atmosphere. Moreover, between c. 1955 and c. 1963, atmospheric nuclear weapon testing resulted in a dramatic increase in the concentration of C-14 in the atmosphere. This was followed by a significant decrease in atmospheric C-14 as restrictions on nuclear weapon testing began to take effect and as rapid exchange occurred between the atmosphere and other carbon reservoirs. The large fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 that occurred prior to 1955 mean that a single radiocarbon date may yield an imprecise calibrated age consisting of several possible age ranges. This difficulty may be overcome by obtaining a series of C-14 dates from a sequence and either wiggle-matching these dates to a radiocarbon calibration curve or using additional information on dated materials and their surrounding environment to narrow the calibrated age ranges associated with each C-14 date. For the period since 1955 (the bomb-pulse period), significant differences in atmospheric C-14 levels between consecutive years offer the possibility of dating recent samples with a resolution of from one to a few years. These approaches to dating the recent past are illustrated using examples from peats, lake and salt marsh sediments, tree rings, marine organisms and speleothems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A seasonal survey of the food web in the Lapalme Lagoon (northwestern Mediterranean) assessed by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to describe the food web of the Lapalme Lagoon, one of the best preserved coastal lagoons along the French Mediterranean coast. Three surveys, corresponding to contrasting situations both in terms of continental inputs and of connection between the lagoon and the open sea, were conducted in June and September 2004 and in February 2005. There were significant spatiotemporal changes in the isotopic ratios of both primary producers and consumers. Temporal changes were mostly linked to important C-13-depleted continental inputs caused by the long period of heavy rainfall before the June survey. Conversely, isotopic ratios were rather similar in September and February despite the opening of the connection of the lagoon with the sea between these two surveys. The interpretation of the results in terms of the structure of the trophic network differed between the June period and the two other ones. In September 2004 and February 2005, the food web was mostly based on SOM and lagoon POM pools with only a few consumers departing from this general trend. In June 2004, a significant proportion of consumers were conversely C-13-depleted probably due to the assimilation of significant amounts of continental inputs by grazers and filter-feeders. This stresses the necessity of carrying out seasonal surveys to get a sound idea of the structure of the food web in highly variable ecosystems such as coastal lagoons. Spatial changes in isotopic ratios were likely linked to: (1) the salinity/confinement gradient with a trend toward lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (i.e., higher continental influence) in the inner part of the main lagoon; and (2) the high delta N-15 values of primary producers and discretely motile consumers in a semi-confined site located downstream a vineyard receiving large amounts of fertilizers. We hypothesised that these inputs are quickly N-15-enriched through denitrification and ammonia volatilisation processes and then contribute to the N-15-enrichment of salt marsh plants and seagrass at this site. This interpretation is supported by the fact that such a 15 N-enrichment of primary producers only occurred in February (i.e., after the dispersion of the fertilizers). Conversely, discretely motile consumers were 15 N-enriched all year round, which suggests that they were mostly exploiting the detritic pool derived from 1 5 N-enriched salt marsh plants.

TI  - An invasive wetland grass primes deep soil carbon pools
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the processes that control deep soil carbon (C) dynamics and accumulation is of key importance, given the relevance of soil organic matter (SOM) as a vast C pool and climate change buffer. Methodological constraints of measuring SOM decomposition in the field prevent the addressing of real-time rhizosphere effects that regulate nutrient cycling and SOM decomposition. An invasive lineage of Phragmites australis roots deeper than native vegetation (Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens) in coastal marshes of North America and has potential to dramatically alter C cycling and accumulation in these ecosystems. To evaluate the effect of deep rooting on SOM decomposition we designed a mesocosm experiment that differentiates between plant-derived, surface SOM-derived (0-40 cm, active root zone of native marsh vegetation), and deep SOM-derived mineralization (40-80 cm, below active root zone of native vegetation). We found invasive P. australis allocated the highest proportion of roots in deeper soils, differing significantly from the native vegetation in root : shoot ratio and belowground biomass allocation. About half of the CO2 produced came from plant tissue mineralization in invasive and native communities; the rest of the CO2 was produced from SOM mineralization (priming). Under P. australis, 35% of the CO2 was produced from deep SOM priming and 9% from surface SOM. In the native community, 9% was produced from deep SOM priming and 44% from surface SOM. SOM priming in the native community was proportional to belowground biomass, while P. australis showed much higher priming with less belowground biomass. If P. australis deep rooting favors the decomposition of deep-buried SOM accumulated under native vegetation, P. australis invasion into a wetland could fundamentally change SOM dynamics and lead to the loss of the C pool that was previously sequestered at depth under the native vegetation, thereby altering the function of a wetland as a long-term C sink.

TI  - Restoring tides to reduce methane emissions in impounded wetlands: A new and potent Blue Carbon climate change intervention
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as "Blue Carbon"), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.

CP  - Conference on Neotectonics and Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution
CL  - UNIV DURHAM, ENVIRONM RES CTR, DURHAM, ENGLAND
AB  - Sea-level reconstruction from biological indicators in saltmarsh sediments requires an understanding of the modern ecology of the organisms concerned. Previous work suggested that testate amoebae are a potential new group of organisms to use for sea-level reconstruction, especially combined with diatoms and foraminifera. This paper analyses data from three saltmarshes on the Taf estuary, South Wales, the River Erme, Devon, and at Brancaster, Norfolk (UK) to (i) test for the presence and zonation of testate amoebae in relation to elevation; (ii) examine the similarity of zonation patterns between marshes; and (iii) explore the relationship between assemblage composition and a wider range of environmental variables. In addition we provide an update on the identification of testate amoebae on saltmarshes. Our results confirm that at all sites the primary environmental gradient is tidal inundation. Major changes in taxa along the tidal gradient are similar except for the lowest elevations, where different taxa become dominant at different sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) shows that assemblage composition is also strongly related to other variables, independent of the tidal position. Salinity, particle size and organic matter content are particularly important, and there is a statistically significant geographical effect on assemblages. Relationships between sea-level and assemblage composition are often stronger for individual sites, suggesting that local data sets should be used for quantitative sea-level reconstructions. However, the combined data set would provide more robust estimates of past sea-level change from fossil data. Other environmental variables explain as much of the variability in species assemblages as tidal parameters and should be considered more often in sea-level reconstructions based on microfossil indicators.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses of the cordgrass Spartina maritima to CO2 enrichment and salinity
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Future climatic scenarios combine increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and rising sea levels. Spartina maritima is a C-4 halophyte that is an important pioneer and ecosystem engineer in salt marshes of the Atlantic coast of southern Europe. A glasshouse experiment investigated the combined effects on its growth and photosynthetic apparatus of approximately doubling CO2 concentration (from 380 to 700 mu mol mol(-1)) at a range of salinity (0, 171 and 510 mM NaCl). We measured relative growth rates, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and total ash, Na+, K2+, Ca2+ and N concentrations. Elevated CO2 stimulated growth of S. maritima by c. 65% at all external salinities; this growth enhancement was associated with greater net photosynthetic rate (A) and improved leaf water relations. A increased despite a drop in stomatal conductance in response to 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. CO2 and salinity had a marked overall effect on the photochemical (PSII) apparatus and the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. Phi(PSII) values at midday decreased significantly with external salinity in plants grown at 380 mu mol mol(-1) CO2; and F-v/F-m and Phi(PSII) values were higher at 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 in presence of NaCl. Plant nutrient concentrations declined under elevated CO2, which can be ascribed to the dilution effect caused by an increase in biomass. The results suggest that the productivity S. maritima and the ecosystem services it provides will increase in likely future climatic scenarios. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sediment input into a floating freshwater marsh: Effects on soil properties, buoyancy, and plant biomass
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal restoration strategies in the Mississippi River Delta Plain include use of direct sediment additions as well as river diversions to reintroduce fresh water and sediments into coastal marshes. Often, these diversions are located in the upper parts of the coastal basins, where fresh water floating marshes predominate. Floating marshes are wetlands of emergent vascular vegetation that have a significant mat of live and dead roots, dead organic material, and mineral sediments. Mats move vertically as ambient water levels rise and fall. As such, extensive water exchange is maintained below the mat, while overland sheet flow is reduced or eliminated, limiting inorganic sediment input. Thus, the effect of sediment introduction into floating marsh wetlands is unknown. In this study, we documented marsh mat response to Mississippi River sediment addition and measured change in soil properties, species composition change, and growth of vegetation. The study included two sites located in seasonally floating thin-mat marshes dominated by spikerush (Eleocharis baldwinii). At each site, 16 plots were established. Each 1 m(2) plot was randomly assigned one of four treatments: none, low, medium, and high sediment additions, with the highest sediment addition representing approximately 15 years of deposition from an existing river diversion at Caernarvon, Louisiana. With increasing sediment addition, significant increases in bulk density, and significant decreases in percent organic matter in the top 25 cm of the marsh mat were observed. Most of the sediment added remained in the top 10 cm of the marsh mat. No significant differences in water level over the mat were found among treatments, indicating that buoyancy was not affected by sediment addition. Aboveground biomass tended to increase with sediment addition, although the differences were not statistically significant. Belowground biomass was not significantly affected by the addition of sediment. These results indicate that sediment additions at the level supplied by existing diversion structures should not sink floating marsh mats and may have slight positive effects on vegetation biomass.

TI  - Effects of the SW Atlantic burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata on a Spartina salt marsh
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we evaluated the effect of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata on the soil quality and on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Argentina, 37 degrees 32' S, 57 degrees 19' W). Soil hardness and percolation rates were higher outside the crab inhabited area than inside, and soil profiles showed 2 different strata in areas without crabs. Crabs were associated with low soil water content, a higher variability in pH, and a homogeneous distribution of organic matter. Meiofaunal abundance was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. The water content of aboveground structures of S. densiflora was lower inside the crab populated areas. Leaf survival was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. In areas with new shoots (after burning by a brush fire) crabs depleted the aboveground plant structures. A caging experiment showed that crabs decreased leaf survival by herbivory. During the experiment, substrata was covered by sediment displaced by crabs, and the area showed less soil hardness and lower percolation rates than controls. Crabs decreased water content and organic matter on upper sediment layers. Meiofaunal abundance (arachnids and insects) was higher in control plots (without crabs) than in treatment plots. A field selection experiment showed that crabs decreased survival of young stems, but did not affect old stems. All this evidence suggests that C, granulata affects cordgrass production by herbivory on new shoots, and can change the physical characteristics of the environment, which may also indirectly affect S. densiflora production. Thus, the general belief that in Spartina marshes only a small proportion of primary production is consumed in situ may not apply to SW Atlantic Spartina marshes inhabited by crabs.

TI  - Disentangling mechanisms that mediate the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in microbial succession
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological succession and the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes are two major themes within microbial ecology, but these conceptual domains have mostly developed independent of each other. Here we provide a framework that integrates shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. Synthesizing previous work, we devised a conceptual model that links ecosystem development to alternative hypotheses related to shifts in ecological assembly processes. Conceptual model hypotheses were tested by coupling spatiotemporal data on soil bacterial communities with environmental conditions in a salt marsh chronosequence spanning 105 years of succession. Analyses within successional stages showed community composition to be initially governed by stochasticity, but as succession proceeded, there was a progressive increase in deterministic selection correlated with increasing sodium concentration. Analyses of community turnover among successional stages-which provide a larger spatiotemporal scale relative to within stage analyses-revealed that changes in the concentration of soil organic matter were the main predictor of the type and relative influence of determinism. Taken together, these results suggest scale-dependency in the mechanisms underlying selection. To better understand mechanisms governing these patterns, we developed an ecological simulation model that revealed how changes in selective environments cause shifts in the stochastic/deterministic balance. Finally, we propose an extended-and experimentally testable-conceptual model integrating ecological assembly processes with primary and secondary succession. This framework provides a priori hypotheses for future experiments, thereby facilitating a systematic approach to understand assembly and succession in microbial communities across ecosystems.

TI  - Ecosystem Development After Mangrove Wetland Creation: Plant-Soil Change Across a 20-Year Chronosequence
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove wetland restoration and creation efforts are increasingly proposed as mechanisms to compensate for mangrove wetland losses. However, ecosystem development and functional equivalence in restored and created mangrove wetlands are poorly understood. We compared a 20-year chronosequence of created tidal wetland sites in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) to natural reference mangrove wetlands. Across the chronosequence, our sites represent the succession from salt marsh to mangrove forest communities. Our results identify important soil and plant structural differences between the created and natural reference wetland sites; however, they also depict a positive developmental trajectory for the created wetland sites that reflects tightly coupled plant-soil development. Because upland soils and/or dredge spoils were used to create the new mangrove habitats, the soils at younger created sites and at lower depths (10-30 cm) had higher bulk densities, higher sand content, lower soil organic matter (SOM), lower total carbon (TC), and lower total nitrogen (TN) than did natural reference wetland soils. However, in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), SOM, TC, and TN increased with created wetland site age simultaneously with mangrove forest growth. The rate of created wetland soil C accumulation was comparable to literature values for natural mangrove wetlands. Notably, the time to equivalence for the upper soil layer of created mangrove wetlands appears to be faster than for many other wetland ecosystem types. Collectively, our findings characterize the rate and trajectory of above- and below-ground changes associated with ecosystem development in created mangrove wetlands; this is valuable information for environmental managers planning to sustain existing mangrove wetlands or mitigate for mangrove wetland losses.

TI  - Salinity tolerance and the decoupling of resource axis plant traits
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions What ecophysiological relationships underlie the sorting of species from freshwater to inland salt marsh communities? Which plant functional trade-offs are present along a gradient of low to high salinity? Location New York State, USA. Methods We evaluated changes in species composition and plant functional traits along resource and salinity gradients at three sites using principal components, correlation and fourth-corner analyses. Results Analyses of plant traits suggested an axis of specialization that was related to salinity tolerance and distinct from a resource axis describing a spectrum of plant traits associated with resource acquisition and retention. Plant species with low scores on the salinity axis had highest abundance in the most saline plots and tended to have small leaf size, high leaf nitrogen per area (Narea), C4 photosynthesis and succulence. Whereas C4 photosynthesis, leaf size and leaf succulence were each linked to patterns of species presence and relative cover along soil Na:K and electrical conductivity (EC) gradients, leaf Narea was most positively correlated with salinity tolerance. Leaf size also played a key role in species sorting along each of the environmental gradients examined in this study (soil EC, Na:K, flooding duration, soil extractable calcium and magnesium and soil N concentrations). Conclusions Salinity tolerance is an alternative axis of plant specialization. The overall trade-off underlying salinity tolerance is inefficient N use in exchange for efficient water use and tolerance of toxic soil salinity levels. This research further elucidates the processes of community assembly along environmental gradients, trade-offs associated with salinity tolerance, and provides baseline information for wetland restoration.

TI  - Global patterns in leaf stoichiometry across coastal wetlands
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Coastal wetlands provide crucial ecosystem functions and services, such as coastal protection, nutrient retention and C sequestration. Despite the important roles in global C, N and P cycling, the global variation in leaf stoichiometry across coastal wetlands remains unclear.Location Global.Time period 1980-2018.Major taxa studied Vascular plants.Methods By compiling a global dataset of 698 data records in 205 sites, we carried out systematic analyses of the world-wide trends and their determinants of leaf element contents and ratios of plants across coastal wetlands.Results Leaf N and P contents increased significantly, but C:N, C:P and N:P ratios decreased with increasing latitude in coastal wetlands. The mean annual temperature was the predominant driver of leaf N, P and C:N, whereas soil N:P was a good predictor of leaf C:P and N:P ratios. Furthermore, N increased faster with P in plant leaves of coastal wetlands compared with terrestrial ecosystems. Within coastal wetlands, herb-dominated salt marshes had a significantly higher leaf P content, lower leaf N:P ratio and lower scaling exponent of leaf N to P than tree-dominated mangroves.Main conclusions The similar latitudinal patterns of leaf stoichiometry in coastal wetlands compared with terrestrial ecosystems reflected the similar influences of temperature. However, different slopes of leaf P and N:P ratios and N and P scaling relationships between these two ecosystems suggested that different salinity and tidal inundation levels result in different strategies of N and P use in coastal wetland plants. These differences in leaf stoichiometry between ecosystems and between different types of coastal wetlands might need to be emphasized in future biogeochemical modelling owing to their different roles in global nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Characterizing trace and major elemental distribution in late Holocene in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China: Paleoenvironmental implications
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) and enrichment factor (EF) were used to investigate the trace and major element concentrations in peat soils of Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. The results showed that elements and paleoenvironmental proxies could be divided into four factoring trends in the late Holocene: (1) soil character change (conservative trace elements and chemical changes) (F1), (2) water table change (aerobic/anaerobic changes) (F2), (3) ability of heavy metal storage change (F3), and climate dry/wet change (F4). In addition, carbon accumulation rates were affected by climate dry/wet change and human activities influence in the recent 1000 years. Furthermore, the results suggested that the concentrations of pollution elements were controlled by both nature and human activities. Anthropogenic influences are the main source of heavy metals in the study sites in the last 200 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Constraints and opportunities for market-based finance for the restoration and protection of blue carbon ecosystems
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration and protection of "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes - has potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions and improve coastal livelihoods. However, realisation of this potential relies on global investment in restoration and protection, which in turn relies on appropriate funding mechanisms that are currently impeded by multiple constraints. Constraints include commercial considerations by private investors (including reliable estimates of financial returns, risk quantification and management, and supply chain impacts), regulatory and legal uncertainty (such as the complexity of property rights in coastal areas, policy coordination across jurisdictions, and stable policy consistent with the duration of blue carbon projects). There are, however, opportunities to improve on current practices, including better stakeholder engagement (including social license to operate, and knowledge transfer to promote best practices), and targeted use of public and philanthropic funding (to subsidise demonstration projects, reduce financial risk through collaterals, and promote low-profit but high co-benefit projects). In this paper, a strategy for the realisation of potential benefits through commercially viable and scientifically robust blue carbon initiatives is presented alongside insights and guidance for the policy, research, civil society, and private sectors to achieve these important long-term outcomes.

TI  - Phosphorus sorption-desorption and effects of temperature, pH and salinity on phosphorus sorption in marsh soils from coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland soils act as a sink or source of phosphorus (P) to the overlaying water due to phosphorus sorption-desorption processes. Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption. The findings of this study indicate that freshwater restoration can contribute to controlling the eutrophication status of water bodies through increasing P sorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystems Contributions to and mechanisms of carbon sequestration
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean's vegetated habitats, in particular seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes, each capture and store a comparable amount of carbon per year, forming the Earth's blue carbon sinks, the most intense carbon sinks on the planet. Seagrass meadows, characterized by high primary productivity, efficient water column filtration and sediment stability, have a pronounced capacity for carbon sequestration. This is enhanced by low decomposition rates in anaerobic seagrass sediments. The carbon captured by seagrass meadows contributes significantly to the total blue carbon. At a global scale, seagrass ecosystems are carbon sink hot spots and have profound influences on the global carbon cycle. This importance combined with the many other functions of seagrass meadows places them among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, seagrasses are declining globally at an alarming rate owing to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, making them also among the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth. The role of coastal systems in carbon sequestration has received far too little attention and thus there are still many uncertainties in evaluating carbon sequestration of global seagrass meadows accurately. To better assess the carbon sequestration of global seagrass ecosystems, a number of scientific issues should be considered with high priorities: 1) more accurate measurements of seagrass coverage at national and global levels; 2) more comprehensive research into species- and location-specific carbon sequestration efficiencies; 3) in-depth exploration of the effects of human disturbance and global climate change on carbon capture and storage by seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial activity promoted with organic carbon accumulation in macroaggregates of paddy soils under long-term rice cultivation
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - While soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stabilization has been increasingly the focus of ecosystem properties, how it could be linked to soil biological activity enhancement has been poorly assessed. In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.

TI  - Tidal freshwater forest accretion does not keep pace with sea level rise
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil properties, accretion, and accumulation were measured in tidal freshwater forests (tidal forests) of the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla rivers of the South Atlantic (Georgia USA) coast to characterize carbon (C) sequestration and nutrient (nitrogen-N, phosphorus-P) accumulation in these understudied, uncommon, and ecologically sensitive wetlands. Carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation also were measured in a tidal forest (South Newport River) that experiences saltwater intrusion to evaluate the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion on C, N and P accumulation. Finally, soil accretion and accumulation of tidal forests were compared with tidal fresh, brackish and salt marsh vegetation downstream to gauge how tidal forests may respond to SLR. Soil accretion determined using C-137 and Pb-210 averaged 1.3 and 2.2 mm yr(-1), respectively, and was substantially lower than the recent rate of SLR along the Georgia coast (3.0 mm yr(-1)). Healthy tidal forest soils sequestered C (4982 g m(-2) yr(-1)), accumulated N (3.25.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and P (0.290.56 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and trapped mineral sediment (340650 g m(-2) yr(-1)). There was no difference in long-term accretion, C sequestration, and nutrient accumulation between healthy tidal forests and tidal forests of the South Newport River that experience saltwater intrusion. Accelerated SLR is likely to lead to decline of tidal forests and expansion of oligohaline and brackish marshes where soil accretion exceeds the current rate of SLR. Conversion of tidal forest to marshes will lead to an increase in the delivery of some ecosystem services such as C sequestration and sediment trapping, but at the expense of other services (e.g. denitrification, migratory songbird habitat). As sea level rises in response to global warming, tidal forests and their delivery of ecosystem services face a tenuous future unless they can migrate upriver, and that is unlikely in most areas because of topographic constraints and increasing urbanization of the coastal zone.

TI  - Tools providing new insight into coastal anoxygenic purple bacterial mats: review and perspectives
T2  - RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal photosynthetic microbial mats are highly structured microbial communities that populate a variety of shallow environments such as estuaries, sheltered sandy beaches, intertidal flats, salt marshes and hypersaline salterns. In soft sediments, most of these microbial mats are formed of vertically stratified, multicolored cohesive thin layers, of several functional groups of microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, distributed along vertical microgradients of oxygen, sulfide and light. These microbial communities are highly productive and significant contributors to carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles and to sediment stability in shallow-water habitats. Many examples of these communities have been cited in the past, but comparatively few microbial mats have been presented for which mass developments of anoxygenic purple bacteria have been observed. Yet, application of molecular approaches has provided fresh insight into the ecology, diversity and evolution of microbial mats. In situ measurements using electrochemical and optical microprobes led to detailed characterization of their physical and chemical environment, whereas reflectance measurements revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of microbial mat surfaces. We hereby report the main discoveries due to introduction of these powerful techniques and we point out the potential insight to be gained from the study of anoxygenic purple bacterial mats.

TI  - Pyrite as a proxy for the identification of former coastal lagoons in semiarid NE Brazil
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to test the suitability of pyrite (FeS2) as a proxy for reconstructing past marine environmental conditions along the semiarid coast of Brazil. Morphological description combined with physicochemical analyses including Fe partitioning were conducted for soil depth profiles (30 and 60 cm depths) at three sites in two contrasting lagoons of the state of Ceara: a suspected former lagoon that would have been transformed into a freshwater "lake" at a site vegetated by Juncus effusus (site P1), and another lagoon with connection to the sea at sites vegetated by J. effusus (site P2) or Portulaca oleracea (site P3). Soil samples were collected in September 2010. Site P3 had more reducing conditions, reaching Eh values of -132 mV in the surface layer (0-10 cm), whereas minimum values for the P1 and P2 sites were +219 and +85 mV, respectively. Lower pyritic Fe values were found at site P1, with a degree of pyritization (DOP) ranging from 10 to 13%. At sites P2 and P3, DOP ranged from 9 to 67% and from 55 to 72%, respectively. These results are consistent with an interruption of tidal channels by eolian dune migration inducing strong changes in the hydrodynamics and physicochemical characteristics (lower salinity, oxidizing conditions) of these sites, causing the dieback of suspected former mangroves and a succession to freshwater marshes with an intermediate salt marsh stage. Together with other physicochemical signatures, pyrite can evidently serve as a useful proxy in tracking environmental changes in such ecotones, with implications for coastal management.

TI  - Redox effects on release kinetics of arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, and vanadium in Wax Lake Deltaic freshwater marsh soils
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of redox potential (E-H), pH, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), chloride (Cl-), aliphatic and aromatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sulfate (SO42-) on the release of dissolved arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), and vanadium (V) were studied in Louisiana freshwater marsh Wax Lake Delta soil (Mississippi River) using an automated biogeochemical microcosm apparatus. The experiment was conducted from reducing (-60 mV) to stepwise oxidizing (+491 mV) conditions. The initial pH was 7.4 and decreased under reducing conditions to 4.9, and remained constant during the increase of EN. Concentrations of As (1.3-120.5 mu g L-1), V (0.9-48.6 mu g L-1), Fe, DOC, and the specific UV absorbance increased under reducing conditions and decreased with rising E-H. Release of As and V appeared to be related to changes of E-H/pH, co-precipitation with Fe oxides, and the release of dissolved aromatic carbon compounds. Concentrations of soluble Cd (4.8-11.2 mu g L-1), Mn, SO42-, and Cl- increased under oxidizing conditions. Release of Co (166.6-258.2 mu g L-1) was related to the chemistry of Fe, Mn and DOC. Phospholipid fatty acids analysis indicated the potential for the microbial community to be involved in biogeochemical processes such as the formation of sulfides, oxidation and reduction of compounds, and the bio-methylation of elements such as As. Overall, we measured a release of As and V under anoxic conditions, while oxic conditions favored the release of Cd. These results outline concern on the potential risk of mobilization of toxic elements in temporary waterlogged soils for agricultural purposes in deltaic ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Hybrid Model for Mapping Relative Differences in Belowground Biomass and Root: Shoot Ratios Using Spectral Reflectance, Foliar N and Plant Biophysical Data within Coastal Marsh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Broad-scale estimates of belowground biomass are needed to understand wetland resiliency and C and N cycling, but these estimates are difficult to obtain because root:shoot ratios vary considerably both within and between species. We used remotely-sensed estimates of two aboveground plant characteristics, aboveground biomass and % foliar N to explore biomass allocation in low diversity freshwater impounded peatlands (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, CA, USA). We developed a hybrid modeling approach to relate remotely-sensed estimates of % foliar N (a surrogate for environmental N and plant available nutrients) and aboveground biomass to field-measured belowground biomass for species specific and mixed species models. We estimated up to 90% of variation in foliar N concentration using partial least squares (PLS) regression of full-spectrum field spectrometer reflectance data. Landsat 7 reflectance data explained up to 70% of % foliar N and 67% of aboveground biomass. Spectrally estimated foliar N or aboveground biomass had negative relationships with belowground biomass and root:shoot ratio in both Schoenoplectus acutus and Typha, consistent with a balanced growth model, which suggests plants only allocate growth belowground when additional nutrients are necessary to support shoot development. Hybrid models explained up to 76% of variation in belowground biomass and 86% of variation in root:shoot ratio. Our modeling approach provides a method for developing maps of spatial variation in wetland belowground biomass.

TI  - Determination of microbial carbon sources in petroleum contaminated sediments using molecular C-14 analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding microbial carbon sources is fundamental to elucidating the role of microbial communities in carbon cycling and in the biodegradation of organic contaminants. Because the majority of anthropogenic contaminants are either directly or indirectly derived from fossil fuels that are devoid of C-14, radiocarbon can be used as a natural inverse tracer of contaminant carbon in the contemporary environment. Here, C-14 analysis of individual microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was used to characterize the carbon sources utilized by the active microbial community in salt marsh sediments contaminated by the Florida oil spill of 1969 in Wild Harbor, West Falmouth, MA. A specific goal was to determine whether this community is actively degrading petroleum residues that persist in these sediments. The Delta C-14 values of microbial PLFA in all sediment horizons (contaminated and noncontaminated) matched the Delta C-14 of the total sedimentary organic carbon after petroleum removal, indicating that no measurable metabolism of petroleum residues was occurring. This result agrees with ancillary data such as the delta C-13 content and distribution of PLFA, and the residual hydrocarbon composition determined by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) analysis. We hypothesize that microbes have chosen to respire the natural organic matter rather than the residual petroleum hydrocarbons because the former is more labile. Future efforts directed at determining indices of microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons should consider competition with natural organic matter.

TI  - Comparison of nutrient accrual in constructed living shoreline and natural fringing marshes
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Living shoreline marshes are coastal wetlands constructed as alternatives to "hardened shorelines" (e.g., bulkheads, riprap) to mitigate erosion and to allow for landward migration of intertidal habitat as sea level rises. Living shorelines are designed to mimic natural fringing marshes and over time should be sinks for carbon and other nutrients. We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2-16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most-but not all-living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades. Living shoreline marshes are on trajectories to match natural marsh function with respect to carbon and nutrient storage in estuarine systems.

TI  - Dissolved Organic Matter Composition in a Marsh-Dominated Estuary: Response to Seasonal Forcing and to the Passage of a Hurricane
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large and complex mixture of compounds with source inputs that differ with location, season, and environmental conditions. Here, we investigated drivers of DOM composition changes in a marsh-dominated estuary off the southeastern United States. Monthly water samples were collected at a riverine and estuarine site from September 2015 to September 2016, and bulk, optical, and molecular analyses were conducted on samples before and after dark incubations. Results showed that river discharge was the primary driver changing the DOM composition at the mouth of the Altamaha River. For discharge higher than similar to 150 m(3)/s, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the terrigenous character of the DOM increased approximately linearly with river flow. For low discharge conditions, a clear signature of salt marsh-derived compounds was observed in the river. At the head of Sapelo Sound, changes in DOM composition were primarily driven by river discharge and possibly by summer algae blooms. Microbial consumption of DOC was larger during periods of high discharge at both sites, potentially due to the higher mobilization and influx of fresh material to the system. The Georgia coast was hit by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, which resulted in a large input of carbon to the estuary. The DOC concentration was similar to 2 times higher and DOM composition was more aromatic with a stronger terrigenous signature compared to the seasonal maximum observed earlier in the year during peak river discharge conditions. This suggests that extreme events notably impact DOM quantity and quality in estuarine regions.Plain Language Summary Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems and characterizing how its composition and concentration change is important to better understand the carbon cycle. Composition and quantity of DOM can vary spatially and temporally due to a variety of factors, including biological activity, precipitation patterns, and proximity to source inputs such as rivers, salt marshes, and the open ocean. To track these changes, monthly water samples were collected and analyzed over the course of a year in a marsh-dominated estuary off the Georgia coast, USA. River flow was shown to be an important factor controlling the amount and type of DOM present at both riverine (Altamaha River) and estuarine (Sapelo Sound) locations. In months with high river flow, organic matter contents were higher and had more terrestrially derived compounds compared to months with low river flow. Additionally, Hurricane Matthew was shown to significantly alter the organic matter at Sapelo Sound, suggesting that extreme events greatly impact DOM quantity and quality in estuarine regions.

TI  - Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) vessel architecture is linked to chilling and salinity tolerance in the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last several decades, the distribution of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans in the Gulf of Mexico has expanded, in part because it can survive the occasional freeze events and high soil salinities characteristic of the area. Vessel architecture may influence mangrove chilling and salinity tolerance. We surveyed populations of A. germinans throughout the Gulf to determine if vessel architecture was linked to field environmental conditions. We measured vessel density, hydraulically weighted vessel diameter, potential conductance capacity, and maximum tensile fracture stress. At each sampling site we recorded mangrove canopy height and soil salinity, and determined average minimum winter temperature from archived weather records. At a subset of sites, we measured carbon fixation rates using a LI-COR 6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System. Populations of A. germinans from cooler areas (Texas and Louisiana) had narrower vessels, likely reducing the risk of freeze-induced embolisms but also decreasing water conductance capacity. Vessels were also narrower in regions with high soil salinity, including Texas, USA and tidal flats in Veracruz, Mexico. Vessel density did not consistently vary with temperature or soil salinity. In abiotically stressful areas, A. germinans had a safe hydraulic architecture with narrower vessels that may increase local survival. This safe architecture appears to come at a substantial physiological cost in terms of reduction in conductance capacity and carbon fixation potential, likely contributing to lower canopy heights. The current distribution of A. germinans in the Gulf is influenced by the complex interplay between temperature, salinity, and vessel architecture. Given the plasticity of A. germinans vessel characters, it is likely that this mangrove species will be able to adapt to a wide range of potential future environmental conditions, and continue its expansion in the Gulf of Mexico in response to near-term climate change.

TI  - Tidal Suppression Negatively Affects Soil Properties and Productivity of Spartina densiflora Salt Marsh
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to intensify cattle utilization, embankments were constructed to avoid tidal ingressions in Samborombon Bay, Argentina, The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tidal suppression and cutting-frequency of a-salt marsh dominated-by Spartina densiflora Brongn. Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of octenol in combination with carbon dioxide (CO2)-baited encephalitis virus surveillance (EVS) mosquito traps was evaluated under Simulated wartime operational conditions during Operation Tandem Thrust (TT01) at the Shoalwater Bay Training area, Queensland, Australia in 2001. A greater number of mosquito species were Captured in traps baited with octenol plus CO2 than those baited with CO2 or octenol in the saltwater marsh, Freshwater Beach. In the inland environments of Camp Growl and Raspberry Creek, the addition of octenol did not significantly increase the numbers of Mosquito species captured. Trap treatment (octenol only, CO2 only, or octenol plus CO2) influenced the species captured at Freshwater Beach. More Ochlerotatus vigilax, Mansonia uniformis, and Coquillettidia xanthogaster were captured in traps baited with octenol plus CO2, and more Anopheles were captured in traps baited With CO2 only. The most commonly Captured (83%) mosquito species in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area during TT01 was the salt marsh breeder and Ross River virus vector, Oc. vigilax.

TI  - Macroinfauna responses and recovery trajectories after an oil spill differ from those following saltmarsh restoration
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the severity of injuries to biota in coastal wetlands from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) and the resulting availability of funding for restoration, information on impacted salt marshes and biotic development of restored marshes may both help inform marsh restoration planning in the near term and for future spills. Accordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to model a restoration trajectory of total macroinfauna density in constructed marshes (studied for similar to 30 y), and with a previously published restoration trajectory for amphipods, we compared these to recovery curves for total macroinfauna and amphipods from DWH impacted marshes (over 8.5 y). Total macroinfauna and amphipod densities in constructed marshes did not consistently reach equivalency with reference sites before 20 y, yet in heavily oiled marshes recovery occurred by 4.5 y post spill (although it is unlikely that macroinfaunal community composition fully recovered). These differences were probably due to initial conditions (e.g., higher initial levels of belowground organic matter in oiled marshes) that were more conducive to recovery as compared to constructed marshes. Furthermore, we found that amphipod trajectories were distinctly different in constructed and oiled marshes as densities at oiled sites exceeded that of reference sites by as much as 20x during much of the recovery period. Amphipods may have responded to the rapid increase and high biomass of benthic microalgae following the spill. These results indicate that biotic responses after an oil spill may be quantitatively different than those following restoration, even for heavily oiled marshes that were initially denuded of vegetation. Our dual trajectories for oil spill recovery and restoration development for macroinfauna should help guide restoration planning and assessment following the DWH as well as for restoration scaling for future spills.

TI  - Seasonal variation in CH4 emission and its C-13-isotopic signature from Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter soils in an estuarine wetland
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although invasions by non-native species represent a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of these invasions on methane (CH4) emission and its C-13-CH4-isotope signature in salt marshes. An invasive perennial C-4 grass Spartina alterniflora has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction from North America in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha Island in the Yangtze River estuary in 1997, S. alterniflora monocultures have become the dominant component of the Jiuduansha's vegetation, where monocultures of the native plant Scirpus mariqueter (a C-3 grass) used to dominate the vegetation for more than 30 years. We investigated seasonal variation in soil CH4 emission and its C-13-CH4-isotope signature from S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter marshes. The results obtained here show that S. alterniflora invasion increased soil CH4 emissions compared to native S. mariqueter, possibly resulting from great belowground biomass of S. alterniflora, which might have affected soil microenvironments and /or CH4 production pathways. CH4 emissions from soils in both marshes followed similar seasonal patterns in CH4 emissions that increased significantly from April to August and then decreased from August to October. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, but negatively correlated with soil moisture for both S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter soils (p < 0.05). The delta C-13 values of CH4 from S. alterniflora, and S. mariqueter soils ranged from -39.0aEuro degrees to -45.0aEuro degrees, and -37.3aEuro degrees to -45.7aEuro degrees, respectively, with the lowest delta C-13 values occurring in August in both marshes. Although the leaves, roots and soil organic matter of S. alterniflora had significantly higher delta C-13 values than those of S. mariqueter, S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change the C-13- isotopic signature of soil emitted CH4 (p > 0.05). Generally, the CH4 emissions from both invasive S. alterniflora and native S. mariqueter soils in the salt marshes of Jiuduansha Island were very low (0.01-0.26 mg m(-2) h(-1)), suggesting that S. alterniflora invasion along the east coast of China may not be a significant potential source of atmospheric CH4.

TI  - Comparative utilization of phytoplankton and vascular plant detritus by the cockle Cerastoderma edule: digestive responses during diet acclimation
T2  - AQUATIC BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Physiological components of food absorption (rates of particle clearance and ingestion and absorption efficiencies) were recorded in the cockles Cerastoderma edule fed variable concentration diets of phytoplankton (Isochrysis galbana) and detritus from salt-marsh vascular plants (Spartina maritina), after 2 and 12 d of acclimation to these diets. Corresponding digestive processes were also analysed, including determinations of gut passage time of food, gut fullness (GF) and digestive investments, the latter measured in terms of both metabolic faecal losses (MFL) and enzyme activities of the digestive glands. Digestive responses to increasing availability of phytoplankton included faster processing of food particles coupled to improved hydrolytic capacity of digestive glands that resulted in increased gut performance. Compared to phytoplankton, detritus utilization was constrained in the short-term by its refractory behaviour to digestion and the magnitude of metabolic faecal losses experienced by cockles fed these food materials. However, increased GF achieved during acclimation to detrital diets compensated for reduced digestibility, allowing for more food to be processed and thus cancelling out the effects of reduced passage time (and the consequent decline in absorption efficiency), Induction of the appropriate set of carbohydrases during the acclimation process resulted in increased amounts of reducing sugars released from natural substrates, with the additional benefit of diminishing the losses of endogenous materials accompanying each cycle of intracellular digestion.

TI  - Changes of sulfur fractions in sediment following Spartina alterniflora invasion in a seaward direction in a temperate salt marsh, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With immense impact on coastal ecosystems' function, especially on nutrient cycle, Spartina alterniflora has become the most importantly invasive species in coastal wetland of China. However, the alternation of sulfur level and transformation between different inorganic sulfur (IS) fractions caused by the plant are poorly understood. In order to study the effect of S. alterniflora invasion and growth on soil IS components, we used space for-time substitution method and examined a whole year dynamics of different sulfur components in 0-60 cm soil of S. alterniflora tidal flat and mudflat at Jiaozhou Bay. Results indicated S. alterniflora improved soil sulfur level and its bio-availability, increased the contents of soil TS, total inorganic sulfur (TIS) and all of the IS fractions except hydrochloric acid volatile sulfur (HVS). But only the rate of soil adsorbed sulfur (AS) to TIS raised following invasion. In addition, S. alterniflora elevated the accumulation sites of soil Hydrochloric acid soluble sulfur (HSS) and HVS from deep soil to rhizosphere in spring. Key impact factors on IS fractions altered as invasion from soil physicochemical factors to plant fctors. Further, S. alterniflora encouraged the transformation of sulfur state from precipitation (HSS, HVS) to dissolved (HS, AS). This implies that the plant induced to an elevation of sulfur provided capacity and a reduction of sulfur toxicity in soil, which has vitally ecological significance for its expansion in costal wetlands. Now, S. alterniflora has occupied large area mudflat and was competing for habitat with native species in Jiaozhou Bay.

TI  - Heavy metal distribution in different soil aggregate size classes from restored brackish marsh, oil exploitation zone, and tidal mud flat of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal distribution in soils is affected by soil aggregate fractionation. This study aimed to demons trate the aggregate-associated heavy metal concentrations and fractionations in "sandy," "normal," and "mud" soils from the restored brackish tidal marsh, oil exploitation zone, and tidal mudflat of the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China.Soil samples were sieved into the aggregates of > 2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and < 0.053 mm to determine the concentrations of exchangeable (F1), carbonate-bound (F2), reducible (F3), organic-bound (F4), and residual fraction (F5) of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn.The 0.25-2 mm aggregates presented the highest concentrations but the lowest mass loadings (4.23-12.18 %) for most metal fractions due to low percentages of 0.25-2 mm aggregates (1.85-3.12 %) in soils. Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %). Most soil aggregates had residual Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and reducible Cd, Pb dominated in the total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates. Although mud soil showed low total concentrations of heavy metals, the relatively high concentrations of bioavailable Cd and Cu resulted from the relatively high Cd (F2) and Cu (F2) in the > 2 mm aggregates indicated contribution of carbonates to soil aggregation and metal adsorption in tidal mud flat.Soil type and aggregate distribution were important factors controlling heavy metal concentration and fractionation in YRD wetland soil. Compared with mud soil, normal soil contained increased concentrations of F5 and F3 of metals in the 0.053-0.25 mm aggregate, and sandy soil contained increased concentrations of bioavailable and total Cr, Ni, and Zn with great contribution of mass loadings in the < 0.053 mm aggregate. The results of this study suggested that oil exploitation and wetland restoration activities may influence the retention characteristics of heavy metals in tidal soils through variation of soil type and aggregate fractions.

TI  - Unraveling Salt Tolerance Mechanisms in Halophytes: A Comparative Study on Four Mediterranean Limonium Species with Different Geographic Distribution Patterns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have performed an extensive study on the responses to salt stress in four related Limonium halophytes with different geographic distribution patterns, during seed germination and early vegetative growth. The aims of the work were twofold: to establish the basis for the different chorology of these species, and to identify relevantmechanisms of salt tolerance dependent on the control of ion transport and osmolyte accumulation. Seeds were germinated in vitro, in the presence of increasing NaCl concentrations, and subjected to "recovery of germination" tests; germination percentages and velocity were determined to establish the relative tolerance and competitiveness of the four Limonium taxa. Salt treatments were also applied to young plants, by 1-month irrigation with NaCl up to 800 mM; then, growth parameters, levels of monovalent and divalent ions (in roots and leaves), and leaf contents of photosynthetic pigments and common osmolytes were determined in control and stressed plants of the four species. Seed germination is the most salt-sensitive developmental phase in Limonium. The different germination behavior of the investigated species appears to be responsible for their geographical range size: L. narbonense and L. virgatum, widespread throughout the Mediterranean, are the most tolerant and the most competitive at higher soil salinities; the endemic L. santapolense and L. girardianum are the most sensitive and more competitive only at lower salinities. During early vegetative growth, all taxa showed a strong tolerance to salt stress, although slightly higher in L. virgatum and L. santapolense. Salt tolerance is based on the efficient transport of Na+ and Cl- to the leaves and on the accumulation of fructose and proline for osmotic adjustment. Despite some species-specific quantitative differences, the accumulation patterns of the different ions were similar in all species, not explaining differences in tolerance, except for the apparent activation of K+ transport to the leaves at high external salinity, observed only in the most tolerant L. narbonenseand L. virgatum. This specific response may be therefore relevant for salt tolerance in Limonium. The ecological implications of these results, which can contribute to a more efficient management of salt marshes conservation/regeneration programs, are also discussed.

TI  - Ecological tradeoffs of stabilized salt marshes as a shoreline protection strategy: Effects of artificial structures on macrobenthic assemblages
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Armoring shorelines to prevent erosion is a long-standing global practice that has well-documented adverse effects on coastal habitats and organisms. A relatively new form of shoreline protection, referred to as hybrid stabilization, incorporates created marsh in combination with a stabilizing structure such as a low-profile stone sill and is being implemented in many US coastal states as a means to not only control erosion but also to restore coastal habitat. However, there has been limited scientific investigation of ecological benefits and impacts associated with implementation of hybrid stabilization. We evaluated relative habitat capacity of marsh-sills by comparing plant, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrate attributes in intertidal and subtidal zones of existing marsh-sills, natural marshes, tidal flats, and riprap revetment within two subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Low and high marsh plant characteristics (stem count and height) of marsh-sills were similar to or greater than natural marshes. However, sediment was coarser, total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were lower, and benthic macrofaunal community structure differed in marsh-sills compared to natural marshes. Marsh-sills supported lower deposit-feeding infaunal biomass than marshes in the intertidal. Epifaunal suspension-feeders were most prevalent at sites with artificial structure (riprap and marsh-sill), but highly variable among subestuaries. Infaunal abundance, biomass, diversity, and proportion of suspension/interface and deposit feeding animals were greater in shallow subtidal than in intertidal environments. Conversion of existing habitat to marsh-sills may cause localized loss of benthic productivity and sediment bioturbation and nutrient-cycling functions, with the opportunity to enhance filtration capacity by epifaunal recruitment to structures. When creating marshes that require structural support, there should be a balance of minimizing loss of existing habitats while encouraging use of suitable structural habitat for suspension-feeders. If properly implemented, the addition of structural habitat could subsidize secondary productivity particularly in areas where loss of complex biogenic habitat (e.g., oyster reefs) has occurred.

TI  - The challenges of measuring methane fluxes and concentrations over a peatland pasture
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on methane (CH4) concentrations and efflux densities that were measured over a drained and grazed, peatland pasture in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California over a three year period. The site was ideal for micrometeorological flux measurements due to its very flat topography, its exposure to vigorous winds and its extended fetch along the predominant wind direction. Nevertheless, the interpretation of methane fluxes with eddy covariance proved to be extremely complicated by a number of geographical, biophysical, biogeochemical and site management factors.Initial inspection of the data revealed unexpected results methane concentrations and efflux densities were greatest during the night rather than during the day. To explain this odd diurnal behavior in methane efflux densities and concentration, we tested two hypotheses. The prime hypothesis presupposed that the stable stratification of the nocturnal boundary layer elongated the flux footprint and enabled the flux tower to sense wetter fields at the western edge of the pasture, flooded drainage ditches, and/or a tidal marsh upwind of the pasture these land forms emitted methane at rates 10-100 times greater than the drained portion of the peatland. And, this methane was emitted into a shallower volume of the atmosphere due to the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer, causing methane concentrations to rise faster. The alternative hypothesis attributed the higher nocturnal methane fluxes to cattle, as they may have congregated near the tower at night.We investigated these hypotheses with: (1) a series of micrometeorological field measurements at companion sites upwind and downwind of the pasture; (2) a series of chamber-based flux measurements on the representative land classes; (3) through the lens of a one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (pbl), box model; and (4) via inspection of digital camera images for the presence or absence of cattle. Together, these pieces of data suggest that elevated methane fluxes and concentrations at night were due to the combined correlation between: (1) the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer; (2) the elongation of the flux and concentration footprints; and (3) the preferential sampling of an elevated methane source, be it the cattle, wet proportions of the field or some combination. On the other hand, our flux measurements were not perturbed by methane emanating from the tidal marsh that was several kilometers upwind of the peatland pasture site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tidal Freshwater Marsh Plant Responses to Low Level Salinity Increases
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) in lower Chesapeake Bay, salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) recently has become established where TFM vegetation previously grew. To determine the potential contribution of saltwater intrusion to the observed species transition, we conducted a mesocosm study subjecting Spartina and two TFM perennials (Peltandra virginica and Leersia oryzoides) to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 2, 4 and 6). We measured plant performance as carbon dioxide flux over the leaf stomata as a proxy for net photosynthesis (Anet), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. For Spartina, all metrics were unchanged across the range of tested salinity. The TFM species, however, had lower Anet than Spartina and decreased with added salinity. TFM biomass was reduced up to 86 % in both the aboveground and belowground compartments, and aboveground nutrient allocation was altered: N increased in Leersia and P increased in Peltandra with increasing salinity. Under this simulation of increased salt intrusion associated with climate change and sea level rise, TFM species responded with decreased biomass and decreased tissue C:N. Although other factors must contribute, the abiotic salt stressor leads to plant responses consistent with the observed replacement of TFM species by Spartina.

TI  - Different microbial functioning in natural versus man-made Mediterranean coastal lagoons in relation to season
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marsh lagoons are of high ecological relevance playing a key role in the carbon cycle but are threatened to disappear due to global change effects. Restoration practices can counteract this process. This study compares the microbial heterotrophic functioning in three "new" man-made lagoons (created in 2016) to that in three "old" lagoons (two natural plus one created in 2002) from a Mediterranean coastal marsh. The activity of a range of microbial extracellular enzymes, the functional diversity, and the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, together with microbial biomass and water physic-chemistry were analysed seasonally in the water column of the six lagoons during 2017. Seasonality was a key driver for the lagoons microbial functioning mainly characterized by lowest microbial activities in winter when DOM was highly aromatic after storm events and an increase in organic matter degradation capabilities from winter to summer probably due to a rise in temperature and DOM input from primary production. Significant differences among lagoons appeared when they were less connected (summer and autumn), and old lagoons showed a greater utilization of proteinaceous and polysaccharidic compounds than new lagoons probably linked to their greater algal biomass (chlorophyll content), which may be supported by their larger phosphorus content. In autumn, there was also a greater use of allochthonous plant material in the old lagoons (higher XYL, and XYL/GLU ratio) probably related to their greater development of riparian vegetation. The functional diversity was the lowest in autumn when the lagoons showed distinct functional fingerprints and the lagoon created in 2002 was grouped with the new ones and distinguished from the natural ones, suggesting that it did not achieve complete restoration. Results indicate that microbial functional parameters related to organic matter use are a relevant and sensitive tool to study lagoon restoration processes, reflecting whole ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Trophic Consistency of Benthic Invertebrates Among Diversified Vegetational Habitats in a Temperate Coastal Wetland of Korea as Determined by Stable Isotopes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of different organic matter sources to macrobenthic consumers was investigated at two vegetational habitats (Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica) and at a bare intertidal flat in Suncheon Bay in May and August 2010, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers. The delta C-13 of consumers was much narrower in range than that of potential food sources (microphytobenthos, marsh plants, and riverine and marine particulate organic matter), and values were similar between sites. However, cluster analysis based on the consumer's isotope values showed that they are divided according to functional groups rather than habitat type and taxonomical group, suggesting that the exploitation of different dietary sources depends on feeding strategy. Except for two suspension feeders and nonselective deposit feeders at the Phragmites bed, most consumers had similar delta C-13 to those of microphytobenthos. An isotopic mixing model calculation revealed the consistent importance of microphytobenthos to the nutrition of benthic invertebrates among wetland habitats in different seasons. In contrast, very little contribution of marsh plant-derived organic matter to consumer nutrition was detected at all sites. Furthermore, our results suggest that the summer monsoon event does not lead to a seasonal shift in dietary sources of consumers in this coastal wetland system.

TI  - A Landscape-Scale Assessment of Above- and Belowground Primary Production in Coastal Wetlands: Implications for Climate Change-Induced Community Shifts
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Above- and belowground production in coastal wetlands are important contributors to carbon accumulation and ecosystem sustainability. As sea level rises, we can expect shifts to more salt-tolerant communities, which may alter these ecosystem functions and services. Although the direct influence of salinity on species-level primary production has been documented, we lack an understanding of the landscape-level response of coastal wetlands to increasing salinity. What are the indirect effects of sea-level rise, i.e., how does primary production vary across a landscape gradient of increasing salinity that incorporates changes in wetland type? This is the first study to measure both above- and belowground production in four wetland types that span an entire coastal gradient from fresh to saline wetlands. We hypothesized that increasing salinity would limit rates of primary production, and saline marshes would have lower rates of above- and belowground production than fresher marshes. However, along the Northern Gulf of Mexico Coast in Louisiana, USA, we found that aboveground production was highest in brackish marshes, compared with fresh, intermediate, and saline marshes, and belowground production was similar among all wetland types along the salinity gradient. Multiple regression analysis indicated that salinity was the only significant predictor of production, and its influence was dependent upon wetland type. We concluded that (1) salinity had a negative effect on production within wetland type, and this relationship was strongest in the fresh marsh (0-2 PSU) and (2) along the overall landscape gradient, production was maintained by mechanisms at the scale of wetland type, which were likely related to plant energetics. Regardless of wetland type, we found that belowground production was significantly greater than aboveground production. Additionally, inter-annual variation, associated with severe drought conditions, was observed exclusively for belowground production, which may be a more sensitive indicator of ecosystem health than aboveground production.

TI  - Zinc tolerance and accumulation in the salt-marsh shrub Halimione portulacoides
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The halophytic shrub Halimione portulacoides is known to be capable of growth in soils containing extremely high concentrations of Zn. This study evaluated in detail the tolerance and accumulation potential of H. portulacoides under moderate and high external Zn levels. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effects of a range of Zn concentrations (0-130 mmol L-1) on growth and photosynthetic performance by measuring relative growth rate, total leaf area, specific leaf area, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and photosynthetic pigment concentrations. We also determined the total zinc, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron and copper concentrations in the plant tissues. H. portulacoides demonstrated hypertolerance to Zn stress, since it survived with leaf concentrations of up to 2300 mg Zn kg(-1) dry mass, when treated with 130 mmol Zn L-1. Zinc concentrations greater than 70 mmol L-1 in the nutrient solution negatively affected plant growth, in all probability due to the recorded decline in net photosynthesis rate. Our results indicate that the Zn-induced decline in the photosynthetic function of H. portulacoides may be attributed to the adverse effect of the high concentration of the metal on photosynthetic electron transport. Growth parameters were virtually unaffected by leaf tissue concentrations as high as 1500 mg Zn kg(-1) dry mass, demonstrating the strong capability of H. portulacoides to protect itself against toxic Zn concentrations. The results of our study indicate that this salt-marsh shrub may represent a valuable tool in the restoration of Zn-polluted areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of Geukensia demissa populations in Rhode Island fringe salt marshes with varying nitrogen loads
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased residential development in coastal watersheds has led to increases in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into estuaries. Sessile bivalves are good candidate organisms to examine nitrogen enrichment effects on consumers because they contribute significantly to material transport from pelagic to benthic systems. We examined condition index (CI), individual dry weight, density, and total biomass in the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn), from 10 marsh sites within Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, subject to varying watershed sub-basin nitrogen loadings. We tested hypotheses that condition and population attributes of G. demissa are driven by watershed sub-basin nitrogen load. There was no clear relationship between the mussel Cl and nitrogen load. G, demissa density and total biomass did increase significantly with increases in nitrogen load. Responses in individual mussel dry weight might be an indirect effect of increased nitrogen loading due to eutrophication-induced changes in food availability. Increased nitrogen loads could be increasing G. demissa food sources, such as Spartina alterniflora detritus, microheterotrophs, particulate organic matter, or phytoplankton, that subsequently translate into higher G. demissa growth and reproduction.

TI  - Nutrients, microbial community structure and functional gene abundance of rhizosphere and bulk soils of halophytes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes occupy the transition zone between terrestrial and marine ecosystem and provide habitat for salt tolerant plant species-halophytes. Dominant halophytes such as Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides and Suaeda maritima play significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient mineralization, nutrient cycling and improving micro-environment. There are scanty reports on the rhizosphere microbial communities of halophytes. Whether the rhizosphere of halophytes harbors unique microbial communities or has species specificity is yet to be established. In the present study, we have determined microbial community structure and functional genes abundance as well as major nutrients and three key enzyme activities in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of three halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus and Suaeda) growing on salty marsh of coastal Gujarat, India. The NH4-N and available K were significantly higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil in all the cases. The rhizosphere of Suaeda was characterized by significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon, total N, NH4-N and available P as compared to other two halophytes. The rhizopsheric soil had significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve and total bacterial PLFA biomarkers compared to the bulk soil. Among halophytes, significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs were recorded in Suaeda and Aeluropus in comparison to Salicornia. The NMS analysis of PLFA profiles revealed a significant difference in microbial community structure in Salicornia compared to Aeluropus and Suaeda. Similarly, rhizosphere microbial community structure of Salicornia was significantly different from Suaeda and Aeluropus. In rhizosphere soils, significantly higher abundance (molar%) of GM-ve, GM +ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs were observed in Aeluropus and Suaeda compared to Salicornia. Activities of beta-glucosidase and urease were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. The abundance of 16S rRNA, cbbL and nifH genes, detected by the quantitative RT-PCR was significantly varied among soils and halophytes. The results exhibited high bacterial diversity, abundance of CO2 and N-fixing bacteria, which can be explored further for their role in C and N cycling for sustainable agriculture and environment management.

T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural and physiological characteristics of C3 and C4 plants (20 species) grown along a soil salinity gradient were studied. The majority of plants occupying salt-marshes were succulent chenopods, mainly C4 annuals. The NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) group was dominant among C4 succulents. The photosynthetic metabolism of C4 plants correlated with ultrastructural changes of assimilating organs. In plants with a low index of granal chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells the malate pool was a larger than the aspartate pool, and in plants with high index of granal chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells the aspartate pool was larger. Among low mass compounds, photosynthetically accumulating under salt stress, alanine (that may promote maintenance of ionic balance) was important.

AB  - Mangrove forests are important coastal wetlands in most of the tropics, but their importance to fisheries is poorly understood. Rationales for conserving these ecosystems are partly based on ideas that mangroves are important to food webs that support fisheries. Here we review use of stable isotopes to test the strength of the mangrove forest-fish connection, suggesting that a dual focus on both food web ecology and habitat use may be most profitable in future studies of this type.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Fluxes from Salt Marshes Exposed to Chronic Nutrient Enrichment
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the impact of nutrient additions on greenhouse gas fluxes using dark static chambers in a microtidal and a macrotidal marsh along the coast of New Brunswick, Canada approximately monthly over a year. Both were experimentally fertilized for six years with varying levels of N and P. For unfertilized, N and NPK treatments, average yearly CO2 emissions (which represent only respiration) at the microtidal marsh (13, 19, and 28 mmoles CO2 m(-2) hr(-1), respectively) were higher than at the macrotidal marsh (12, 15, and 19 mmoles m(-2) hr(-1), respectively, with a flux under the additional high N/low P treatment of 21 mmoles m(-2) hr(-1)). Response of CH4 to fertilization was more variable. At the macrotidal marsh average yearly fluxes were 1.29, 1.26, and 0.77 mu mol CH4 m(-2) hr(-1) with control, N, and NPK treatments, respectively and 1.21 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1) under high N/low P treatment. At the microtidal marsh CH4 fluxes were 0.23, 0.16, and -0.24 mu mol CH4 m(-2) hr(-1) in control, N, and NPK and treatments, respectively. Fertilization changed soils from sinks to sources of N2O. Average yearly N2O fluxes at the macrotidal marsh were -0.07, 0.08, and 1.70, mu mol N(2)Om(-2) hr(-1) in control, N, NPK and treatments, respectively and 0.35 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1) under high N/low P treatment. For the control, N, and NPK treatments at the microtidal marsh N2O fluxes were -0.05, 0.30, and 0.52 mu mol N(2)Om(-2) hr(-1), respectively. Our results indicate that N2O fluxes are likely to vary with the source of pollutant nutrients but emissions will be lower if N is not accompanied by an adequate supply of P (e.g., atmospheric deposition vs sewage or agricultural runoff). With chronic fertilization the global warming potential of the increased N2O emissions may be enough to offset the global cooling potential of the C sequestered by salt marshes.

AB  - We investigated the effect of intraspecific competition on growth parameters and photosynthesis of the salt marsh species Atriplex prostrata Boucher in order to distinguish the effects of density-dependent growth inhibition from salt stress. High plant density caused a reduction of 30% in height, 82% in stem dry mass, 80% in leaf dry mass, and 95% in root dry mass. High density also induced a pronounced 72% reduction in leaf area, 29% decrease in length of mature internodes and 50% decline in net photosynthetic rate. The alteration of net photosynthesis paralleled growth inhibition, decreasing from 7.6 +/- 0.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at low density to 3.5 +/- 0.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at high density, indicating growth inhibition caused by intraspecific competition is mainly due to a decline in net photosynthesis rate. Plants grown at high density also exhibited a reduction in stomatal conductance from 0.7 +/- 0.1 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1) at low density to 0.3 +/- 0.1 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1) at high density and a reduction in transpiration rate from 6.0 +/- 0.3 mmol H2O M-2 s(-1) at low density to 4.3 +/- 0.3 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1) at high density. Biomass production was inhibited by an increase in plant density, which reduced the rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and leaf area of plants. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sarcocornia fruticosa photosynthetic response to short-term extreme temperature events in combination with optimal and sub-optimal salinity concentrations
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change would increase frequency and intensity of extreme events as heat and cold waves. There is a lack of studies that consider the co-occurrence of these waves with other abiotic factors relevant on a climate change scenario as salinity. Therefore, it could be interesting to improve our knowledge about the effects that this co-occurrence could have in different species due to the species specific effect of the photosynthesis tolerance to extreme temperatures. A controlled condition experiment was performed using the salt marsh species Sarcocornia perrnis with eight experimental blocks combining temperature ranges (40-28/22-15/13.5 degrees C) and salinity concentration on the growth solution (171/1050 mM NaCl). After 3 days of treatment, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, pigment profile and water state measurement were applied. Photosynthetic machinery function of this perennial species decreased on for both high and low temperature range. Nevertheless, at 13.5 degrees C the effect of the salinity was mainly due to diffusion limitations more than to damage on the photosystems. At 40-28 degrees C, in presence of optimal salinity S. fruticosa was not altered overall, However, high temperatures in combination with high salinity reduced the photosynthetic capacity mainly by reducing the efficiency of the electron transport chain.

TI  - The Impact of Climate Change on Mangrove Forests
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests have survived a number of catastrophic climate events since first appearing along the shores of the Tethys Sea during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The existence of mangrove peat deposits worldwide attests to past episodes of local and regional extinction, primarily in response to abrupt, rapid rises in sea level. Occupying a harsh margin between land and sea, most mangrove plants and associated organisms are predisposed to be either resilient or resistant to most environmental change. Based on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts, mangrove forests along arid coasts, in subsiding river deltas, and on many islands are predicted to decline in area, structural complexity, and/or in functionality, but mangroves will continue to expand polewards. It is highly likely that they will survive into the foreseeable future as sea level, global temperatures, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale variation in both the number and relatedness of genetic individuals can influence a range of ecological and evolutionary processes. However, we often have little information from natural populations regarding the fine-scale distribution of genetic diversity. We quantified multiple metrics of genetic diversity in the widespread, dominant marsh plant Spartina alterniflora across 3 spatial scales in 16 natural marshes in the Florida Panhandle. We also examined correlations between genetic diversity and marsh plant species diversity, along with key environmental variables that may influence both. Most of the variance in S. alterniflora genetic structure was explained by variation within sampling areas across sites. S. alterniflora genetic diversity and marsh plant species diversity increased with spatial scale within sites. In addition, diversity was generally higher on mainland marsh sites compared to discrete marsh islands, consistent with theoretical predictions from island biogeography and population genetics. Multiple metrics of genetic diversity increased with island area and with distance to the mainland. Despite significant correlations between diversity and tidal height, sediment organic content, and sediment porewater salinity, site type (mainland or island) and spatial scale were the best predictors of S. alterniflora genetic and marsh plant species diversity. We show that natural populations of S. alterniflora exhibit significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure, and thus continued loss of habitat could lead to a substantial loss of genetic diversity.

TI  - Impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil inorganic carbon in coastal wetlands in China
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion has profoundly influenced coastal soil reservoirs of carbon. Previous carbon studies regarding biological invasion in coastal wetlands mainly focused on soil organic carbon; however, little is known about the mechanisms that control soil inorganic carbon (SIC, e.g., carbonates) variation. In order to explore our understanding, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate controlling mechanisms of SIC in response to Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) invasion in the east-central China coast, where there is a lack of native salt marsh species. A space-for-time substitution method was used to identify sampling sites, assuming it has the capability to quantify the soil-vegetation relationship along a gradient of the increasing S. alterniflora age (17 year). The results showed that soil inorganic carbon density (SICD) at the 0.3-0.6 m depth exhibited a decline under S. alterniflora invasion, while there was no substantial change at the depths of 0-0.3 m and 0.6-1 m. The majority of the variances in SICD changes could be explained by S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables. In SEM, S. alterniflora invasion, soil water content, and soil texture presented direct influence on SICD throughout the soil profile (i.e., to 1 m depth). Soil salinity presented direct influence on SICD in the upper 0.6 m soil, while pH played an important role in the depth of 0.6-1 m. These results highlight that dynamics of SIC processes are probably controlled by interactions among S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables.

TI  - Limits on the adaptability of coastal marshes to rising sea level
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assumptions of a static landscape inspire predictions that about half of the world's coastal wetlands will submerge during this century in response to sea-level acceleration. In contrast, we use simulations from five numerical models to quantify the conditions under which ecogeomorphic feedbacks allow coastal wetlands to adapt to projected changes in sea level. In contrast to previous sea-level assessments, we find that non-linear feedbacks among inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition, allow marshes to survive conservative projections of sea-level rise where suspended sediment concentrations are greater than similar to 20 mg/L. Under scenarios of more rapid sea-level rise (e. g., those that include ice sheet melting), marshes will likely submerge near the end of the 21st century. Our results emphasize that in areas of rapid geomorphic change, predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change requires consideration of the ability of biological processes tomodify their physical environment.

TI  - Effects of the addition of nitrogen and sulfate on CH4 and CO2 emissions, soil, and pore water chemistry in a high marsh of the Min River estuary in southeastern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exogenous nitrogen (N) and sulfate (SO42-), resulting from human activity, can strongly influence the emission of CH4 and CO2 from soil ecosystems. Studies have reported the effects of N and SO42- on CH4 and CO2 emissions from inland peatlands and paddies. However, very few studies have presented year-round data on the effects of the addition of N and SO42- on CH4 and CO2 emissions in estuarine marshes. The effects of the addition of N and SW on the emission of CH4 and CO2 were investigated in a Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the high tidal flat of the Min River estuary of southeastern China from September 2014 to August 2015. Dissolved NH4Cl, KNO3, and K2SO4 were applied every month, in doses of 24 g N/SO42- yr(-1). The emission of CH4 and CO2 showed distinct monthly and seasonal variations. Compared with the control, the addition of NH4Cl and NH4NO3 + K2SO4 showed increases in CH4 fluxes (p < 0.05), while the effects of the addition of KNO3 and K2SO4 on CH4 were minor (p > 0.05). NH4CI had a positive impact on CO2 emissions (p < 0.01), while the addition of KNO3, K2SO4, and NH4NO3 K2SO4 had minor positive impacts, compared to the control (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis found that soil sulfate concentration, nitrogen availability and enzyme activity were the dominant factors influencing CH4 and CO2 variation. Our findings suggest that CH4 and CO2 emissions were influenced more by ammonium than by nitrate. We propose that the suppressive effect of additional sulfate on CH4 production is insignificant, due to which the inhibition may be overestimated in the estuarine brackish marsh.

TI  - Hard science is essential to restoring soft-sediment intertidal habitats in burgeoning East Asia
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh, and tidal flats face multiple stresses along the burgeoning East Asia coastline. In addition to direct habitat loss, ecosystem structure, function, and capacity for ecosystem services of these habitats are significantly affected by anthropogenic loss of hydrologic connectivity, introduction of invasive exotic species, and chemical pollution. These dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function are illustrated by four case studies along the East Asian coast: the Mai Po Marshes in Hong Kong, the Yunxiao wetlands in Fujian, China, and the Lake Sihwa and Saemangeum tidal flats in Korea. While investment in restoration is increasing significantly in the region, the lack of key basic knowledge on aspects of the behaviour of intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems, particularly those in Asia, impairs the effectiveness of these efforts. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function for relatively species-poor mangrove, seagrass, and saltmarsh systems has implications for restoration targeting monospecific plantations. The trajectory of recovery and return of ecosystem function and services is also poorly known, and may deviate from simple expectations. As many introduced species have become established along the East Asian coast, their long-term impact on ecosystem function as well as the socio-economics of coastal communities demand a multidisciplinary approach to assessing options for restoration and management. These knowledge gaps require urgent attention in order to inform future restoration and management of intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems in fast-developing East Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A knowledge of the total amount of trace metals is not enough to assess the environmental impact of polluted soils. For this reason, the determination of metal species in solution is important to evaluate their behavior in the environment and their mobilization capacity. Soils contaminated by Cu, Pb, Cd, end Zn found at Donana National Park (Spain) were examined for total content, sequential extraction schemes were used to determine the degree of pollution and to partition the trace elements in soils. The three areas studied (marshes, stabilized sand, and mine) have different contamination levels. The northern-most marshes of Donana National Park have the highest total levels of the four metals due to the influence of a mine located 40 km away. The stabilized sand was not polluted by the metals stud led. The bioavailable fraction of Cd represents more than 50% of the fetal Cd found in soils, and this percentage is much greater than that of the other elements examined. Most of the Cu was present in the organic fraction, with only small amounts being associated with the crystalline Fe-oxide fraction. Lead and Zn were associated mainly with the crystalline Fe-oxide fraction, but the amount of Zn associated with the carbonates and amorphous Fe-oxide fractions was also significant. The total amount of Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn in the soils and their distribution in the five fractions depended on total metal contents, soil type, and soil properties (i.e., pH and percentage of sand, clay, organic matter, and carbonates). Mobility of soil metals were Cd > Zn > Pb > Cu.

TI  - Isotopic variation of fishes in freshwater and estuarine zones of a large subtropical coastal lagoon
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used stable C and N isotope ratios of tissues from 29 fish species from a large subtropical lagoon in southern Brazil to examine spatial variability in isotopic composition and vertical trophic structure across freshwater and estuarine habitats. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated a smooth gradation in trophic positions among species, with most fishes occupying the secondary and tertiary consumer level. Fish assemblages showed a significant shift in their carbon isotopic signatures between freshwater and estuarine sites. Depleted carbon signatures (from -24.7 parts per thousand., to - 17.8 parts per thousand) were found in freshwater, whereas more enriched signatures (from - 19.1 parts per thousand to - 12.3 parts per thousand) were obtained within the estuarine zone downstream. Based on our survey of the C-3 and C-4 plants and isotopic values for phytoplankton and benthic microalgae reported for ecosystems elsewhere, we hypothesized that the observed delta C-13 differences in the fish assemblage between freshwater and estuarine sites is due to a shift from assimilating organic matter ultimately derived from C-3 freshwater marsh vegetation and phytoplankton at the freshwater site (delta C-13 ranging from -25 parts per thousand to - 19 parts per thousand), to C-4 salt-marsh (e.g. Spartina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton at the estuarine sites (from - 18 parts per thousand to - 12 parts per thousand). Our results suggested that fish assemblages are generally supported by autochthonous primary production. Freshwater fishes that likely were displaced downstream into the estuary during periods of high freshwater discharge had depleted delta C-13 values that were characteristic of the upper lagoon. These results suggest that spatial foodweb subsidies can occur within the lagoon. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination and grazing on the abundance and composition of microphytobenthos in salt marsh sediments (Pass Fourchon, LA) - I. A microcosm experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A microcosm experiment was conducted to examine the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) contamination on the abundance and composition of microphytobenthos in surface (0-10 cm) sediments collected from a salt marsh in Pass Fourchon, LA. Plant pigment biomarkers were used to monitor changes in the microphytobenthos in sediments (over 60 days) with treatments containing high and low concentrations of PAMs. Grazing pressure on microphytobenthos by the periwinkle snail Littorina irrorata as well as its responses to PAH contamination were also examined.Concentrations of total PAHs declined in sediments over the duration of the experiment in all microcosms. There was a pattern of increasing relative abundance of high-molecular-weight PAHs in High-PAM sediments (5.5-16 ppm). Microphytobenthic biomass, estimated by chlorophyll-a concentrations, did not significantly change in the treatments with Low-PAM sediments (0.04-0.33 ppm); however, biomass decreased significantly in all treatments after 4 days from 64 mu g to 2-8 mu g g dry sed.(-1). Concentrations of the carotenoids fucoxanthin (a biomarker for diatoms) and zeaxanthin (a biomarker for cyanobacteria) were consistent with chlorophyll-a, showing little change in Low-PAM treatments; sediments from the High-PAM treatments showed significantly higher concentrations of fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin (1.8 and 1.2 mu g g dry sed(-1), respectively) than the Low-PAM treatments during the initial phase of the microcosm experiment. However, concentrations of fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin decreased dramatically after 4 days to 0.1-0.3 mu g g dry sed-L and 0.01-0.15 mu g g dry sed(-1): respectively. Increased total phaeophorbide concentrations (a biomarker for metazoan grazing) over the first 12 days of the experiment in treatments with and without L. irrorata additions indicated that meiobenthos may have been important in grazing-down microphytobenthos. High-Exposure snails (from High-PAM field sites) gained more weight during the initial phase of the experiment when microphytobenthic abundance was decreasing but eventually lost more weight than did Low-Exposure snails (from Low-PAM field sites) by the end of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the snail growth values, we speculate that the High-Exposure snails were more active in feeding during this experiment and, after the initial decline in microphytobenthos, became resource-limited throughout the remainder of the experiment.

TI  - Ecophysiological characteristics of invasive Spartina alterniflora and native species in salt marshes of Yangtze River estuary, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions represent one of the significant components of global change. A comparative study of invaders and co-occurring natives is a useful approach to gaining insights into the invasiveness of exotic plants. Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 grass, is a widespread invader in the coastal wetlands in China and other regions of the world. We conducted a comparative study of S. alterniflora and native C-3 species, Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, in terms of their gas exchange and efficiencies in resource utilization. We tested the hypothesis that S. alterniflora has growth-related ecophysiological advantages over the natives in its non-native range, which result in its rapid growth and enhance its invasiveness. Photosynthesis, leaf area index (LAI), specific leaf area (SLA), and the efficiency of resource use (light, water, and nitrogen) were examined monthly for eight months in 2004. Overall, S. alterniflora had greater LAI, higher maximal net photosynthetic rate (Amax), and longer growing season than those of the native species. On average, the efficiencies of S. alterniflora in light, water, and nitrogen utilization were respectively 10.1%, 26.1%, and 33.1% higher than those of P. australis, and respectively 70.3%, 53.5%, 28.3% higher than those of S. mariqueter. However, SLA of S. alterniflora was significantly lower than those of P. australis and S. mariqueter. Although there was no general pattern in the relationship between invasiveness and plant photosynthetic types, in this study, most of the ecophysiological characteristics that gave S. alterniflora a competitive advantage in the Yangtze River estuary were associated with photosynthetic pathways. Our results offer a greater understanding of the relationship between invasiveness and plant photosynthetic type. Our results also indicate that LAI and the length of the photosynthetic season, which vary with habitats, are also important in invasion success. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal marshes must accumulate soil to keep up with rising sea levels. It is unknown how the response of these ecosystems to global change will influence their ability to continue to keep up with sea-level rise. Here, we describe an in situ experimental chamber approach for manipulating key environmental variables, such as atmospheric CO2 and soil N availability, in a brackish marsh. We outfitted each chamber with surface elevation tables (SETs) to closely monitor soil elevation change, a sensitive indicator of marsh vulnerability to sea-level rise. Further, the design facilitates measurements of ecosystem exchange of CO2, plant productivity, porewater chemistry, and other environmental parameters.

TI  - Origin and composition of organic matter in tidal flat sediments from the German Wadden Sea
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two sediment cores of up to 550 cm length from an intertidal flat of the German Wadden Sea near the island of Spiekeroog were investigated for the quantity and composition of fossil organic matter (OM). The lowermost parts of the cores are dominated by grey mud of a salt marsh facies containing mainly terrestrial OM estimated to account for 60-75% of the total OM, based on delta C-13 values and the ratio of short to long chain n-alkanols. The terrigenous origin of the dominant fraction is indicated, among others, by high proportions Of C-29 sterols and long chain n-alkanes typical of plant waxes. Coarse shell beds overlying the grey mud at 2-2.5 m depth represent a flooding and erosion event possibly related to heavy storm floods in the Middle Ages. Within the intertidal sand-dominated sediments in the upper parts of the cores total organic carbon (TOC) contents are generally low, ranging from 0.1 % to 0.5%, and correlate well with the amount of mud fraction (r(2) 0.90). At the surface, marine OM has not undergone intense diagenetic alteration and so is the dominant fraction. Eroded peat particles are common throughout most of the sequence and values of the Phragmites peat indicator (PPI) > 5 indicate an origin from reed peat due to a high relative abundance of the n-C-24 alkane. Changes in the composition of microbial communities over the depth interval investigated are documented by varying compositions of unsaturated fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbons. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was detected along the entire cores and indicates the presence of EPA-producing bacterial strains. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Two temperature optima of methane production in a typical soil of the Elbe river marshland
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil of the Elbe river marshland was classified as calcareous freshwater marsh (USDA: typic fluvaquent). Methanogenic bacteria were found in oxic as well as in anoxic soil layers. Most probable number counts varied from 1.4x10(2) to 2.5x10(6) bacteria g(-1) fresh weight. Methane production at different temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C) was studied with undisturbed soil cores. The highest methane production rates were measured at 10 degrees C (0.31 nmol h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1)) and 20 degrees C (0.58 nmol h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1)). Incubation experiments with disturbed soil material showed two optima of methane production at 10 degrees C and in the mesophilic temperature range. Experiments with different substrates indicate that at 10 degrees C acetate serves as substrate while at higher temperatures hydrogen is the main energy source for methanogens.

TI  - Influences of salinity and shade on seedling photosynthesis and growth of two mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle and Bruguiera sexangula, introduced to Hawaii
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rhizophora mangle was first introduced to Hawaii in 1902 to promote shoreline stabilization. Intertidal competition with native and introduced salt marsh species was low, and beyond the early 1920s, mangrove forests expanded rapidly. An additional mangrove species, Bruguiera sexangula, was introduced in 1922 and currently co-occurs with R. mangle in only a few stands on the north shore and windward sides of Oahu. Where the two species overlap, R. mangle, having colonized intertidal zones first, forms nearly monospecific forest stands. To determine why R. mangle remains the dominant mangrove, we initiated a greenhouse study to compare seedling growth and photosynthetic light response of both species growing at two light levels and contrasting salinity regimes (2, 10, 32 PSU). The asymptotic nature of B. sexangula's assimilation response is indicative of stomatal regulation, whereas only light level appears to regulate photosynthesis in R. mangle. Shifts in patterns of biomass allocation and physiological response indicate two contrasting strategies relative to sunlight and salinity. B. sexangula's strategy is characterized by slow growth with little variation under favorable conditions and morphological plasticity under stressful conditions, which allows for adjustments in carbon gain efficiency (morphological strategy). On the other hand, R. mangle's strategy involves faster growth under a wide range of environmental conditions with physiological enhancement of carbon assimilation (physiological strategy). Low salinity combined with reduced light, or simply low sunlight alone, appears to favor R. mangle and B. sexangula equally. High salinity places greater, but not overwhelming, stress on B. sexangula seedlings, but tends to favor R. mangle at higher light levels. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Pond Excavation Reduces Coastal Wetland Carbon Dioxide Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however, anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17% of the bay's tidal wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function.Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

TI  - Landscape Effects on the Presence, Abundance and Diversity of Mosquitoes in Mediterranean Wetlands
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environment determines the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases in that it influences the vector-host-pathogen transmission cycle, including vector distribution, abundance and diversity. In this study, we analyse the relationship between environmental variables estimated by remote sensing and the spatial distribution (presence, abundance and diversity) of seven mosquito species vectors of West Nile and other pathogens (Usutu, avian malaria and dirofilariasis) in the Donana Natural Park, Spain. Traps were distributed over an area of 54,984 ha divided into six ecological units: marshland, sand dunes, scrubland, ricefields, crops and fishponds. We collected mosquitoes once a month from up to 112 locations using BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-lure and CO2 during March-November 2010. Hydroperiod, NDVI and Inundation surface were estimated at several resolution scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 metres) from corrected and normalized Landsat Images. We sampled 972,346 female mosquitoes, the most abundant species being Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus caspius, Culex modestus, Culex perexiguus, Culex pipiens, Anopheles atroparvus and Ochlerotatus detritus. Our results suggest that: (1) hydroperiod, inundation surface and NDVI are strongly related to the spatial distribution of mosquitoes; (2) the spatial scales used to measure these variables affected quantification of these relationships, the larger scale being more informative; (3) these relationships are species-specific; (4) hydroperiod is negatively related to mosquito presence and richness; (5) Culex abundance is positively related to hydroperiod; (6) NDVI is positively related to mosquito diversity, presence and abundance, except in the case of the two salt marsh species (Oc. caspius and Oc. detritus); and (7) inundation surfaces positively condition the abundance and richness of most species except the salt marsh mosquitoes. Remote sensing data provided reliable information for monitoring mosquito populations. Landscape significantly affected mosquito distribution and abundance, and as a result may alter disease risk. These results suggest that while environmental conditions affect the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes, other factors such as human modification of landscapes may give rise to significant changes in mosquito populations and consequently disease risk.

TI  - Habitat-specific distinctions in estuarine denitrification affect both ecosystem function and services
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Resource limitation controls the base of food webs in many aquatic ecosystems. In coastal ecosystems, nitrogen (N) has been found to be the predominant limiting factor for primary producers. Due to the important role nitrogen plays in determining ecosystem function, understanding the processes that modulate its availability is critical. Shallow-water estuarine systems are highly heterogeneous. In temperate estuaries, multiple habitat types can exist in close proximity to one another, their distribution controlled primarily by physical energy, tidal elevation and geomorphology. Distinctions between these habitats such as rates of primary productivity and sediment characteristics likely affect material processing. We used membrane inlet mass spectrometry to measure changes in N-2 flux (referred to here as denitrification) in multiple shallow-water estuarine habitats through an annual cycle. We found significantly higher rates of denitrification (DNF) in structured habitats such as submerged aquatic vegetation, salt marshes and oyster reefs than in intertidal and subtidal flats. Seasonal patterns were also observed, with higher DNF rates occurring in the warmer seasons. Additionally, there was an interaction between habitat type and season that we attributed to the seasonal patterns of enhanced productivity in individual habitat types. There was a strong correlation between denitrification and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in all habitats and all seasons, suggesting the potential to utilize SOD to predict DNF. Denitrification efficiency was also higher in the structured habitats than in the flats. Nitrogen removal by these habitats was found to be an important contributor to estuarine ecosystem function. The ecosystem service of DNF in each habitat was evaluated in US dollars using rates from a regional nutrient-offset market to determine the cost to replace N through management efforts. Habitat-specific values of N removal ranged from approximately three thousand U.S. dollars per acre per year in the submerged aquatic vegetation to approximately four hundred U.S. dollars per acre per year in the subtidal flat. Because of the link between habitat type and processes such as DNF, changes in habitat area and distribution will have consequences for both ecosystem function and the delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to assess the effect of soil salinity and some other environmental factors on the plant community diversity in saline and marshy depressions of the western Mediterranean region of Egypt. The community diversity is negatively correlated with soil salinity and with the other related soil variables (clay, organic matter and water holding capacity). The habitat change, as a result of active sand deposition and process of hummock formation, also has a great impact on community diversity. The plant cover is negatively correlated with diversity. These findings are discussed in terms of adaptation theory.

TI  - Biomass production in pioneer Spartina anglica patches: Evidence for the importance of seston particle deposition
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh formation can be initiated by the colonization of bare tidal flats by pioneer halophytes such as Spartina anglica. In the present study, growth of S. anglica in the edge and centre zones of pioneer patches colonizing a tidal flat in a marine bay in the south-west Netherlands was investigated. Average biomass and shoot length was significantly lower in centre zones than in edge zones of the patches. Multiple linear regression showed that 84% of the variance in aboveground biomass in the centre zones could be explained by sediment phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. No such relationship existed in the edge zone. This suggests that biomass production in the centre zones of the patches is nutrient limited, but that factors other than sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content determine growth of Spartina in the edge zones.The sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the centre zones of the patches were significantly related with sediment carbon concentrations, indicating that the pool of particle-bound nutrients in the sediment to an important extent is associated with organic particles. Determination of stable carbon isotope signatures of the sedimentary organic matter showed that an increasing carbon content of the sediment in the centre zone of the patches land a rise in plant biomass) coincides with a higher contribution of non-Spartina derived carbon to the sedimentary organic matter pool. Sustained biomass production in the centre zones of the patches, thus, probably depends on deposition of allochthonous organic particles and the nutrient inputs inherent in this process. Due to the construction of large-scale hydro-engineering works, however, conditions for deposition of waterborne particles are currently unfavourable. The consequences of reduced carbon and nutrient inputs into the patches will be particularly in the (older) centre zones, where the nutrient pools in non-refractory organic matter have been drained in the years of previous growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the canopy-enhanced sedimentation for which Spartina is well-known, via positive feed-back effects on plant growth can be crucial for plant vitality, and, hence, for successful colonization of unvegetated areas.

TI  - Effects of static vs. tidal hydrology on pollutant transformation in wetland sediments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addressed effects of hydrology on biogeochemical processes relevant to pollutant chemical transformation in wetland sediments. Microcosms were designed to impose three hydrologic conditions on salt marsh sediments: (i) drained-oxidized redox potenial (Eh); (ii) flooded-reduced Eh and, (iii) diurnal tide-oscillating Eh. The test chemicals were N- and/or S-heterocycles (NSHs) including quinoxaline (1,4-benzodiazine), 2-methylquinoxaline(2-methyl-1,4-benzodiazine), 2,3-dimethylquinoxalinen (2,3-dimethyl-1,4,benzodiazine), phenazine (2,3,5,6-dibenzo-1,4-diazine), acridine (2,3,5,6-dibenzopyridine), dibenzothiophene (2,3,5-dibenzothiophene), phenothiazine (dibenzo-1,4-thiazine), and phenanthridine (2,3-benzoisoquinoline). Biogeochemical processes reflected the hydrologic conditions in ways analogous to field settings, e.g., Eh characteristics were drastically different: static (flooded and drained) systems had reduced (mu = - 428 mV +/- 57) and oxidized (mu = + 73 mV - 32) values, respectively, with no evidence of periodic variation while the tidal systems exhibited regularly oscillating Eh (amplitudes 40-250 mV). Sediment trace gases also corresponded to the Eh, with the major species detected being CO2 and H2O (drained, tidal) vs. CO2 + H2O + sulfides + methane (flooded). The NSH transformation rates were different in each hydrologic regime and decreased as follows: tidal greater than or equal to drained much greater than flooded. These results indicated that there were subtle differences in NSH processing in drained and tidal systems, but both of these systems transformed NSHs faster and to lower levels than flooded sediments. These data suggest that in situ remediation options that preserve wetland integrity and tidal hydrology can be as or more effective than static conditions that obtain in approaches such as impoundment and excavation-upland placement.

TI  - Elevated CO2 enhances biological contributions to elevation change in coastal wetlands by offsetting stressors associated with sea-level rise
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Sea-level rise, one indirect consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2, poses a major challenge to long-term stability of coastal wetlands. An important question is whether direct effects of elevated CO2 on the capacity of marsh plants to accrete organic material and to maintain surface elevations outweigh indirect negative effects of stressors associated with sea-level rise (salinity and flooding).2. In this study, we used a mesocosm approach to examine potential direct and indirect effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration, salinity and flooding on elevation change in a brackish marsh community dominated by a C-3 species, Schoenoplectus americanus, and a C-4 grass, Spartina patens. This experimental design permitted identification of mechanisms and their role in controlling elevation change, and the development of models that can be tested in the field.3. To test hypotheses related to CO2 and sea-level rise, we used conventional ANOVA procedures in conjunction with structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM explained 78% of the variability in elevation change and showed the direct, positive effect of S. americanus production on elevation. The SEM indicated that C-3 plant response was influenced by interactive effects between CO2 and salinity on plant growth, not a direct CO2 fertilization effect. Elevated CO2 ameliorated negative effects of salinity on S. americanus and enhanced biomass contribution to elevation.4. The positive relationship between S. americanus production and elevation change can be explained by shoot-base expansion under elevated CO2 conditions, which led to vertical soil displacement. While the response of this species may differ under other environmental conditions, shoot-base expansion and the general contribution of C-3 plant production to elevation change may be an important mechanism contributing to soil expansion and elevation gain in other coastal wetlands.5. Synthesis. Our results revealed previously unrecognized interactions and mechanisms contributing to marsh elevation change, including amelioration of salt stress by elevated CO2 and the importance of plant production and shoot-base expansion for elevation gain. Identification of biological processes contributing to elevation change is an important first step in developing comprehensive models that permit more accurate predictions of whether coastal marshes will persist with continued sea-level rise or become submerged.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical coastal wetlands and alternative agricultural land uses
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

TI  - Eutrophication in Portuguese estuaries evidenced by delta N-15 of macrophytes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial inputs of nitrogen in estuaries are increasing and altering salt marsh primary production, plant communities and associated biota. We used N isotope ratios and %N in Spartina maritima, Halimione portulacoides, Zostera noltii and below-canopy sediments to study eutrophication caused by anthropogenic land-derived nitrogen in the Mondego and Mira estuaries, Portugal. In spite of different land use practice intensities between estuaries, there were no marked differences in nitrate concentrations in the water column, but ammonium, total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations were greater in the Mondego estuary. Sediment and shoot N contents suggest a general pattern of high nitrogen regimes in Mondego and Mira, and point to a somewhat higher delivery of nitrogen into the Mondego. However, these parameters were not sensitive indicators of level of eutrophication. In contrast, delta(15) N ratios in plant shoots differed significantly and were higher in Mondego for all 3 plant species. Plant delta(15) N signatures were therefore more sensitive sentinels of land-derived nitrogen load. The parallel increase of delta(15) N in shoots and sediments indicated that both shoots and sediments followed and reflected the level of eutrophication and some larger whole estuary difference in N loads. Thus, nitrogen isotopic signatures in macrophytes and sediments were useful indicators of land-derived nitrogen in estuaries.

TI  - Late Holocene paleoenvironmental changes in the Seal Beach wetland (California, USA): A micropaleontological perspective
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollen, benthic foraminifera, diatoms, sediment grain size, and organic matter content from a 230-cm long-AMS dated sediment core (Core SB-51B) were used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes and paleoclimatic evolution within the Seal Beach wetland (southern California, USA), during the last similar to 2000 years. A Q-mode cluster analysis based on diatom and foraminiferal data identified three distinct units: 1) the lowest sandy to silty-sand unit deposited before 1838 cal years BP (230 -140 cm in depth) is devoid of microfossils; 2) a clay rich intermediate unit dated between 1838 and 513 cal years BP (140-52 cm) is dominated by brackish and brackish-marine diatoms and foraminifera; and 3) a clay-rich zone deposited after 513 cal years BP(52 cm to the surface) contains high salt marsh adapted microfossils. Fresh-water and salt-tolerant diatoms from Unit 2 indicated several fresh-water influx events at 105 cm, 82 cm, and 75 cm possibly from a nearby stream. A shift from saltmarsh plants to terrestrial plants was inferred by pollen analysis. Throughout the record, the pine pollen increases suggest a shift towards cooler and wetter conditions during the last 300 years. Regional pollen records support our findings indicating a trend from drier conditions during the last 1800 years to the cooler, more mesic conditions of the Little Ice Age. The analyzed sedimentary sequence indicated the possible occurrence of three seismic events during the Late Holocene: E3 and E2 before 1760 cal years BP and E1, which took place just prior to 390 cal years BP.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VEGETATION AND SOIL FORMATION IN A RAPIDLY SUBMERGING COASTAL MARSH
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purposes of this study were to determine the relative importance of organic matter and mineral matter to marsh vertical accretion and to determine if insufficient vertical accretion was a factor in land loss in a Terrebonne Basin (Louisiana, USA) marsh. Cs-137 dating indicated that vertical accretion (0.98 cm yr-1) was extremely rapid relative to other marshes, but insufficient to counter submergence (1.38 cm yr-1). Mineral and organic matter accumulation were similar to that in other marshes. Variation in vertical accretion was accounted for by variation in organic matter accumulation rather than mineral matter accumulation; thus, inadequate vertical accretion resulted from inadequate organic matter accumulation. Inadequate organic matter accumulation (593 g m-2 yr-1) was attributed to inadequate plant production resulting primarily from flooding stresses; inadequate mineral matter accumulation (1629 g m-2 yr-1) was attributed to inadequate mineral matter availability. These data suggest that this marsh is threatened by a positive feedback loop of plant flooding stress and inadequate vertical accretion. Inadequate plant growth limits vertical accretion, which further increases flooding and decreases plant production. Thus plant production, which has previously been considered only in the context of trophic dynamics, also partly determines the degree of submergence some coastal and estuarine marshes will tolerate.

TI  - Secondary productivity of macrobenthos in mangrove and salt marsh in Gaoqiao of Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province of South China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the secondary productivity of macrobenthos in different botanic habitats in intertidal zone in Gaoqiao of Zhanjiang, the Brey' s empirical formula was applied to calculate the secondary productivity based on the investigations in the habitats of Sonneratia apetala Aegiceras corniculatum, Sporobolus virginicus, and Bruguiera conjugate in four seasons, 2010. The secondary productivity of the macrobenthos in the habitats in four seasons was averagely 11.77 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1), being the highest in S. apetala habitat (18. 16 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), followed by in A. corniculatum habitat (17. 67 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), S. virginicus habitat (8. 34 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)), and B. conjugate habitat (2. 92 g AFDM . m(-2) . a(-1)). The P/B ratio of the macrobenthos was the highest in B. conjugate habitat (2. 38), followed by in S. virginicus, S. virginicus, and A. corniculatum habitats, with the values of 1. 23, 0. 99, and 0. 48, respectively. The differences in the secondary productivity and P/B ratio of the macrobenthos among the four botanic habitats were mainly related to the sediment total organic carbon, food type, and macrobenthos individual size.

TI  - Organic matter accumulation in western boreal saline wetlands: A comparison of undisturbed and oil sands wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing landscapes after open pit mining of the Canadian oil sands presents enormous challenges. Freshwater peatlands dominate the pre-disturbance landscape; however, elevated salinity in the post-disturbance landscape will exclude the use of many freshwater vegetation species for reclamation. Successful reclamation will require plants to grow and accumulate peat despite elevated salinity. We evaluated the potential of salt-tolerant plants to accumulate peat by integrating plant production and decomposition rates in natural and oil sands wetlands across a salinity gradient. These wetlands were dominated by marsh-like vegetation with relatively rapid decomposition, especially of the belowground plant material. Aboveground production was high enough to compensate for rapid decomposition, resulting in mean annual organic matter accumulation of 307 g m(-2). Thus, both natural wetlands (which despite the elevated salinity had peat deposits >35 cm) and the oil sands wetlands accumulated organic matter during the study. There is potential for peat to accumulate in future oil sands wetlands, although long-term accumulation rates may be slower than in undisturbed freshwater fens and bogs. A reliable water supply and a host of other factors will be required for wetlands to accumulate organic matter, and eventually peat, in the post-mining landscape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pH, alkalinity (Alk), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in estuarine waters of several rivers of Georgia in the southeastern United States are reported. Although they discharge into a narrow area in the South Atlantic Eight, the rivers along the coast of Georgia differ significantly in their drainage area (piedmont rivers vs. coastal plain rivers), chemical composition (contents of carbonate and humics), and discharge rates. Large differences in pH, DIG, and Alk between these rivers clearly reflect the differences of material inputs to the rivers. Dramatic pH increases in the early stage of mixing (more obvious for the coastal plain rivers) reflect the low buffering capacity of the river waters despite the high content of humic substances. Flux of riverine DIC to the South Atlantic Eight is estimated to be 52.5 X 10(9) mol yr(-1). We suggest that the presently available world total riverine DIC flux to the ocean could have much uncertainty if the small river fluxes are important. Calculated pCO(2) values from the pH and DIC measurements are extremely high in low-salinity areas (1,000 to >6,000 mu atm at salinity <10) as are the corresponding CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere (20 to >250 mol m(-2) yr(-1) at salinity <10). Data presented suggest that the most Likely causes that sustain the high pCO(2) values and high water-to-air fluxes in the estuaries are CO2 inputs from organic carbon respiration in the tidally flooded salt marshes and groundwater.

T2  - BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF HORSESHOE CRABS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on the Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs
CL  - Dowling Coll, Oakdale, NY
AB  - Horseshoe crabs are valued for economic, ecological, and educational purposes. These values have raised interest in managing natural stocks and culturing crabs for conservation, research, and education. To inform these efforts, we used N and C stable isotopes to define the natural diet of juvenile horseshoe crabs and then assessed effects of different diets on growth and survival of juveniles in culture. In the natural environment, N and C isotope ratios in juvenile horseshoe crabs changed as crabs grew, with larger crabs consuming larger prey. Linear mixing analyses suggested young crabs were supported by high quantities of benthic and suspended particulate organic matter (POM), shifting between marine algae and salt marsh-based food webs, depending on size. In culture, we tested the relative importance of algae, as a proxy for POM, in horseshoe crab diet by feeding juvenile crabs different percentages of algae and prey animals. Initially,juvenile crabs showed a significant increase in size when fed diets >70% protein, but showed a decrease in survival compared to algae-rich diets. Overall, growth rates and survival declined through time during the 128-day study, regardless of diet composition. These data Suggest horseshoe crabs require foods from a combination of plant and animal sources. Successful culture or conservation of horseshoe crabs will depend on understanding the relative importance of different food sources at different life stages as well as discerning the balance between factors that increase growth, but reduce survival.

TI  - ANOXIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF RADIOLABELED HYDROGEN-SULFIDE IN MARINE AND FRESH-WATER SEDIMENTS
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiolabeled hydrogen sulfide (HS-)-S-35 was used to trace the anoxic sulfur transformations in marine and freshwater sediment slurries. Time course studies consistently showed a rapid (S2O3=)-S-35 formation and a progressive accumulation of (SO4=)-S-35 and thus indicated an anoxic sulfide oxidation to sulfate. Thiosulfate was partly turned over by oxidation or disproportionation and was found to be an intermediate in the (SO4=)-S-35 formation. The results demonstrate that oxidative and reductive sulfur cycling may occur simultaneously in marine and freshwater sediments. When added as exogenous oxidant, nitrate (NO3-) stimulated the anoxic sulfide oxidation to sulfate. Ferric iron, added in the form of lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), caused the precipitation of iron sulfides and only partial sulfide oxidation to pyrite and elemental sulfur.

TI  - A carbon isotope method to quantify groundwater discharge at the land-sea interface
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new method to characterize and quantify groundwater discharge to estuaries and the coastal ocean. Using data from the Pages Creek estuary in the Cape Fear region of southeastern North Carolina, we show that the concentration and carbon isotopic composition (Delta(14)C and delta(13)C values) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) can provide a tracer of a single, well-defined component of the surface water-groundwater system in coastal regions-the integrated freshwater discharge to an estuary from confined aquifers. Groundwater from the two shallowest confined aquifers in the Cape Fear region (the Castle Hayne and the Peedee) has DIC Delta(14)C values ranging from -282parts per thousand to -829parts per thousand, significantly lower than the radiocarbon content of surficial (water table) groundwater, rivers and streams, and seawater in the area (Delta(14)C = -38parts per thousand to +97parts per thousand). DIC additions from salt marsh decomposition and DIC removal via photosynthesis and gas evasion can influence estuarine DIC concentrations and DIC delta(13)C values. However, none of these processes results in strongly depleted DIC Delta(14)C values. Because artesian springs are the only significant low-Delta(14)C DIC input to the Pages Creek estuary, flood-ebb C-14 budgets provide a direct measure of the fraction of the total freshwater inputs to the Pages Creek estuary that is derived from artesian discharge. With this method, we have observed a striking range in the relative contribution of artesian flow to the Pages Creek estuary freshwater budget. During November 1999 and April 2001 (both periods of low precipitation in southeastern North Carolina), artesian groundwater discharge could account for essentially all of the Pages Creek freshwater inputs. In contrast, during July 2000 (a period of high precipitation in this region), artesian groundwater made a negligible contribution to the creek's freshwater budget.

AB  - Wetland stability has ramifications for habitat availability, carbon sequestration, and coastal hazards. An understanding of wetland sediment budgets is necessary for modeling marsh vulnerability and prioritizing future salt marsh management actions. With funding from the Natural Resource Preservation Program (NRPP), the USGS made oceanographic measurements in order to quantify wetland sediment transport parameters within two Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network park units Gateway National Recreation Area (Jamaica Bay) and Fire Island National Seashore (Great South Bay)with the goal of informing management efforts. Bottom landing platforms with instrumentation to measure currents, waves, water level, optical turbidity, water temperature, conductivity, and water quality parameters were deployed at two sites in Jamaica Bay, and four sites in Great South Bay. In Jamaica Bay, platforms were deployed in sequential periods: August 15-October 16, 2017, October 18-December 11, 2017, December 14, 2017-January 27, 2018, and March 27-June 13, 2018. In Great South Bay, platforms were deployed in sequential periods: August 17-October 19, 2017, October 21-December 21, 2017, and March 28-June 27, 2018.

TI  - Effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling: interactions and feedbacks
T2  - PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Solar UV radiation, climate and other drivers of global change are undergoing significant changes and models forecast that these changes will continue for the remainder of this century. Here we assess the effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles and the interactions of these effects with climate change, including feedbacks on climate. Such interactions occur in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. While there is significant uncertainty in the quantification of these effects, they could accelerate the rate of atmospheric CO2 increase and subsequent climate change beyond current predictions. The effects of predicted changes in climate and solar UV radiation on carbon cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are expected to vary significantly between regions. The balance of positive and negative effects on terrestrial carbon cycling remains uncertain, but the interactions between UV radiation and climate change are likely to contribute to decreasing sink strength in many oceanic regions. Interactions between climate and solar UV radiation will affect cycling of elements other than carbon, and so will influence the concentration of greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases. For example, increases in oxygen-deficient regions of the ocean caused by climate change are projected to enhance the emissions of nitrous oxide, an important greenhouse and ozone-depleting gas. Future changes in UV-induced transformations of aquatic and terrestrial contaminants could have both beneficial and adverse effects. Taken in total, it is clear that the future changes in UV radiation coupled with human-caused global change will have large impacts on biogeochemical cycles at local, regional and global scales.

CL  - WASHINGTON, D.C.
AB  - Seasonal variations in the sediment porewater concentration profiles of organic and inorganic sulfur species at a Chesapeake Bay channel site provide new insight into an esturarine sulfur cycle. Oxidation of sulfide, as evidenced by the presence of zero-valent sulfur, occurs in this sulfidic sediment despite bottom water column and sediment anoxia. Thiosulfate shows a bimodal occurrence profile with a maximum in the late spring and fall, and is absent in midsummer. Two thiols, cysteine and glutathione, show maximal concentrations at 4 cm in mid-summer, which overlaps the highest gradient of sulfide and zero-valent sulfur occurrence patterns, suggesting a role in elemental sulfur redox or transport processes. Mercaptoacetate and mercaptopyruvate, were found in much lower concentrations and appear to be linked to the diagenesis of cysteine. Two mercaptopropanoic acids show temporal profiles increasing with sediment depth and may be linked to deeper sediment methanogenic bacterial activities.

TI  - Integrating Successional Ecology and the Delta Lobe Cycle in Wetland Research and Restoration
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inactive deltas are more extensive than active deltas in most deltaic landscapes; thus, the subsurface generally is dominated by mineral sediments that rapidly accreted at different times, whereas the landscape at any one time generally is dominated by ephemeral emergent wetlands that are slowly accreting via vegetative growth. Subsidence is slow enough in most deltas that emergent wetlands, although ephemeral, can persist for millennia but accelerating global sea level rise probably will slow wetland creation in active deltas and accelerate the loss of existing wetlands in inactive deltas this century worldwide. A recent publication created confusion regarding the effects of river management on coastal Louisiana, where spatially variable subsidence is great enough in some areas to mimic extremely rapid sea level rise. I show how integrating Successional Ecology with the Delta Lobe Cycle, and correcting some omissions and errors in recent publications, clarifies the effects of river management in coastal Louisiana and provides a framework for predicting deltaic landscape dynamics worldwide. Successional Ecology provides a framework for understanding changes in natural and managed environments worldwide, whereas the Delta Lobe Cycle provides a framework for understanding river-dominated deltas worldwide. Sediment diversions are a form of river management that removes artificial barriers to river flow and are designed to mimic hydrologic conditions during the active delta stage of the Delta Lobe Cycle by focusing rapid mineral sedimentation in open water and thus creating new emergent wetlands. Freshwater diversions are another form of river management that also removes artificial barriers to river flow but are designed to mimic hydrologic conditions during the inactive stages of the Delta Lobe Cycle by reducing salinity stress over large areas of emergent wetlands and thus promoting marsh vertical accretion via vegetative growth. The Delta Lobe Cycle and both types of river diversions also create salinity gradients that simultaneously increase the sensitivity of emergent wetlands to disturbance while increasing the ability of emergent wetlands to recover from disturbance. Freshwater diversions only slow the loss of existing wetlands because the natural Delta Lobe Cycle, artificial channels that increase salinity stress, artificial ridges that increase flooding stress, and repeated disturbances eventually will cause vertical accretion via vegetative growth to become inadequate. Formally integrating these concepts might advance research and restoration in deltaic landscapes worldwide especially in the majority of deltas where inactive deltas are more extensive than active deltas.

TI  - Distribution characteristics and influencing factors of the benthic macroinvertebrate functional groups in the salt marshes of Chongming Dongtan
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on monthly surveys in the salt marshes of Chongming Dongtan in the Yangtze Estuary, we analyzed the distribution characteristics of macroinvertebrate functional groups and driving factors , especially exotic plants , along an elevation gradient. The results showed that dominant species varied across different elevations. Both omnivores and herbivores were dominant functional groups in the middle tiddal zone , while omnivores were dominant in the other sites. Both the abundance and biomass of each functional group significantly varied along the elevation gradient (P<0.01) , and such variations differed for different functional groups. The abundance and biomass of carnivores in the lowest mudflat were significantly higher than those in the vegetated zones (P< 0.05 ) , while those of herbivores in the middle tidal zone, occupied by Scirpus mariqueter, were significantly higher than that in the other sites (P<0.05). Main habitat factors (including total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic matter, available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen contents and median-sized grain of the sediment) , and shoot height and aboveground biomass of the vegetation, varied significantly along the elevation gradient ( P <0.05) , and the characteristics of those variations changed among different factors. The invasion of Spartina alterniflora did not change the dominant functional group in the high tidal zone, but increased the abundance and biomass of omnivores (P<0.05). Some environmental factors, including available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and organic matter of the sediment , were significantly different between invasive S. alterniflora and natural Phragmites australis zones (P<0.05). The variations of the composition and distribution of the benthic macroinvertebrate functional groups were determined by the combination of multiple environmental factors, while the main factors varied with groups. Nutrient content and salinity of the sediment were the most important factors driving the abundance and biomass of the functional groups, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the comprehensive effects of various environmental variables including hydrology, vegetation and sediment when we examine the distribution characteristics and underlying mechanism of functional groups of benthic macroinvertebrate.

TI  - Decomposition dynamics of six salt marsh halophytes as determined by cupric oxide oxidation and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a comparative study on the aerobic decomposition of six salt marsh plant species over a period of 2 yr. In addition to ash-free dry weight (AFDW) determination and elemental analysis (C and N), two analytic methods have been applied to obtain insight into the decomposition dynamics of lignin in the various plant tissues. The analytic methods an (1)cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and(2) direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS).AFDW losses could generally be well described by double exponential relations with time. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios increased during the initial stages of decomposition and decreased again afterward. For five of the six plant species, a correlation between initial lignin content and AFDW loss was observed. Decay dynamics of lignin denoted a rapid relative increase during the first weeks of field exposure, followed by stabilizing contents over the next 2 yr. CuO oxidation data indicate the establishment of a stable "lignin endmember" within 1-2 months. DT-MS data, on the contrary, showed continuous modification of the lignin polymer throughout the duration of the experiment.Evidence was found for the incorporation of (presumably) microbial N-acetylglucosamine in the complex residue produced upon decomposition. Combination of CuO oxidation and DT-MS data suggested that lignin degradation products became attached to the original macromolecular material and could still be identified as lignin-derived material. The data support a humification mechanism via condensation of small degradation products instead of the selective preservation of certain biomacromolecules (like lignin).

TI  - Changes in soil properties induced by pioneer vegetation patches in coastal ecosystem
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization occurs naturally in coastal areas owing to seawater intrusion and upward salt accumulation. High soil salinity limits most plants and the plant community in coastal salt marsh is mainly composed of salt-tolerant plants. The resilience of ecosystem is largely determined by the standing vegetation. However, little is known about how pioneer vegetation impacts on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, especially associated with salinization. Thus, field investigations were conducted to evaluate the difference of soil indicators in vegetation patches with that in bare lands during an intense soil salinization period in Bohai Sea coastal wasteland, North China. Root distribution for vegetation patches and soil physicochemical properties for vegetation patches and bare lands were examined in 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depth layers. The results showed that regardless of the plant species, roots in vegetation patches were mainly distributed in 0-20 cm depth and greatly promoted the soil spatial heterogeneity. Particularly, soils beneath vegetation patches exhibited higher soil total carbon content, total porosity, macro-porosity, large aggregates percentage, mean weight diameter, and saturated water content; lower bulk density, capillary porosity, soil water storage capacity, and soil electrical conductivity than that for bare lands in 0-20 cm depth. The correlation analysis among topsoil (0-20 cm) indicated that the formation of soil large aggregates and pore structure was negatively related to soil electrical conductivity. In conclusion, vegetation patches promoted the formation of soil large aggregates and macro-porosity in topsoil by root distribution. Moreover, the plant-mediated soil structure improvement enhanced the soil resistance to salt accumulation and further promoted the topsoil desalinization. The findings of this study provide some insights into the regulation of pioneer vegetation on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, supporting ecological succession and plant-mediated ecological restoration in saline lands.

TI  - Identification and characterization of humic substances-degrading bacterial isolates from an estuarine environment
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial isolates were obtained from enrichment cultures containing humic substances extracted from estuarine water using an XAD-8 resin. Eighteen isolates were chosen for phylogenetic and physiological characterization based on numerical importance in serial dilutions of the enrichment culture and unique colony morphology. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that six of the isolates were associated with the a subclass of Proteobacteria, three with the gamma -Proteobacteria, and nine with the Gram-positive bacteria. Ten isolates degraded at least one (and up to six) selected aromatic single-ring compounds. Six isolates showed ability to degrade [C-14]humic substances derived from the dominant salt marsh grass in the estuary from which they were isolated (Spartina alterniflora), mineralizing 0.4-1.1% of the humic substances over 4 weeks. A mixture of all Is isolates did not degrade humic substances significantly faster than any of the individual strains, however, and no isolate degraded humic substances to the same extent as the natural marine bacterial community (3.0%). Similar studies with a radiolabeled synthetic lignin ([beta-C-14]dehydropolymerisate) showed measurable levels of degradation by all 18 bacteria (3.0-8.8% in 4 weeks), but mineralization levels were again lower than that observed for the natural marine bacterial community (28.2%). Metabolic capabilities of the Is isolates were highly Variable and generally did not map to phylogenetic affiliation. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

TI  - Taillardat et al. (2020) - Restoration cost database V5.xlsx from Climate change mitigation potential of wetlands and the cost-effectiveness of their restoration
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks, yet they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine the role they play on climate and discuss their suitability for inclusion in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) mitigation policies; (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation strategies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB)=28.119.13 gC m2 y1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential (SGWP)=298.2100.6 gCO2 eq1 m2 y1). This ambivalence shows that the choice of metric can lead to misinterpretation on the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review report high heterogeneity and a still limited number of studies that document wetland carbon budgets. In this study, we demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce and the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere, compared with long-term carbon sequestration for older inland wetlands. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C1) compared with inland wetlands (US$ 4200-49200 ton C1). For inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration, while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Above- and belowground biomass and nutrient pools of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in a South American salt marsh
T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to examine the role of position in the tidal range on biomass production and nutrient pools in Spartina alterniflora in an Argentinian estuary, we estimated productivity, the concentration of C, N and P in tissues and pools (concentration x biomass) of these elements in low (LM) and high (HM) zones. Aboveground biomass of S. alterniflora was higher in HM than in LM. Aboveground primary productivity was 106 and 439 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1) in LM and HM, respectively. Belowground biomass was similar in LM and HM. Belowground primary productivity was 526 and 744 g dry wtm(-2) year(-1) for LM and HM, respectively. Nutrient pools were higher in HM than in LM. Biomass and productivity values were low, which makes nutrient pools low. The lower values of the parameters analysed in LM than in HM indicate that position in the tidal range is an important factor in this system, possibly due to the effect of flooding. Moreover, this pattern is opposite to the general one observed in the northern hemisphere, meaning that studying marshes from different environments is worth doing. Because pools were higher in HM, this zone would be more important for nutrient input to the estuary.

TI  - State Changes in Tropical Intertidal Systems: A Palaeo-Ecological Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim was to review ecosystem state changes and the role of palaeo-ecological tools with application to intertidal subtropical and tropical intertidal wetlands. These systems are especially vulnerable to stress from sea-level change, climate change, and development activities. Responses to stress can lead to significant state changes with the system passing thresholds, potentially beyond recovery. Indicators of state changes and approaching tipping points include a critical slowing down following perturbation signalled by, for example, slowing recovery rates, increased attribute variance, and changed skewness. To identify such changes, data are needed for the relevant variables such as vegetation, sea level, and sediment processes so as to observe the indicative changes and their timing. Because changes may be relatively slow in ecological terms, very long-term data are needed to inform management about future likely states or thresholds so that mitigation or adaptation can be planned. One approach is to use palaeo-ecological data. These data are relatively scarce in tropical intertidal systems. This paper reviews a range of palaeo-indicators. These include state indicators (pollen, foraminifera, and diatoms), stable isotope analysis, and stratigraphy and temporal indicators involving sediment dating. Each is potentially useful, although there are uncertainties related to, for example, the redistribution organic matter in sediment cores. In conclusion, it is recommended that integrating or combining several indicators can assist in triangulating results, thereby increasing confidence in their interpretation. It is also suggested that data, if available, can be retrofitted to assess at least some of the state change indicators, such as data variance and skewness.

TI  - Microbial Community Structure and Function in Peat Soil
T2  - FOOD TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Many peatlands in Europe have been subjected to land reclamation and systematic drainage, which have substantially affected nutrient cycles in the soil. This work reviews published studies on microbial processes linked to carbon and nitrogen transformations in the soils of the Ljubljana marsh, a drained peatland positioned close to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This region is known for its dramatic diversity of animal and plant life, but below ground it hides diverse bacterial and archaeal communities that are highly responsive to environmental changes and make the Ljubljana marsh soils a good source of N2O and CO2, and a sink for CH4. Methanogenesis is highly restricted in these soils due to competition for electron donors with iron reducers. In addition, methane is efficiently removed by methanotrophs, which are highly active, especially in the soil layers exposed to the changing water table. Denitrification is limited by electron acceptors and in deeper soil layers also by carbon, which becomes more recalcitrant with depth. Nitrification involves bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers with ammonia oxidation rates being among the highest in the world. Interestingly, ammonia-oxidising Thaumarchaeota in acidic bog soils thrive only on ammonia released through mineralisation of organic matter and are incapable of oxidising added mineral ammonia. The soils of the Ljubljana marsh are rich in bacterial laccase-like genes, which may encode enzymes involved in lignin degradation and are therefore interesting for bioexploitations. Future challenges involve designing studies that will reveal specific physiological functions of phenol oxidases and other enzymes involved in peat transformations and address relations between microbial diversity, function and ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbances.

TI  - Comparing Automated Classification and Digitization Approaches to Detect Change in Eelgrass Bed Extent during Restoration of a Large River Delta
T2  - NORTHWEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Native eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an important contributor to ecosystem services that supplies cover for juvenile fish, supports a variety of invertebrate prey resources for fish and waterbirds, provides substrate for herring roe consumed by numerous fish and birds, helps stabilize sediment, and sequesters organic carbon. Seagrasses are in decline globally, and monitoring changes in their growth and extent is increasingly valuable to determine impacts from large-scale estuarine restoration and inform blue carbon mapping initiatives. Thus, we examined the efficacy of two remote sensing mapping methods with high-resolution (0.5 m pixel size) color near infrared imagery with ground validation to assess change following major tidal marsh restoration. Automated classification of false color aerial imagery and digitized polygons documented a slight decline in eelgrass area directly after restoration followed by an increase two years later. Classification of sparse and low to medium density eelgrass was confounded in areas with algal cover, however large dense patches of eelgrass were well delineated. Automated classification of aerial imagery from unsupervised and supervised methods provided reasonable accuracies of 73% and hand-digitizing polygons from the same imagery yielded similar results. Visual clues for hand digitizing from the high-resolution imagery provided as reliable a map of dense eelgrass extent as automated image classification. We found that automated classification had no advantages over manual digitization particularly because of the limitations of detecting eelgrass with only three bands of imagery and near infrared.

TI  - Origin, composition and quality of suspended particulate organic matter in relation to freshwater inflow in a South Texas estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - South Texas has a semi-arid climate with a large interannual variability of freshwater inflows. This study sought to define how changes in freshwater inflow affect the composition, quantity and quality of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) in a South Texas estuary: the Mission-Aransas estuary. The study was implemented 1.5 months after a large rain event in September 2010 and continued for 10 months of drought conditions. The composition of SPOM originating from rivers, the Gulf of Mexico and the estuary were determined using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34). The quantity and quality of SPOM were assessed using organic carbon content, chlorophyll a concentrations and C/chl a ratios. Our results demonstrated that autochthonous phytoplankton was the dominant component of SPOM in the Mission-Aransas estuary during droughts. Benthic organic matter from local primary producers (i.e., seagrass, salt marsh plants, benthic microalgae) did not influence SPOM composition, either as fresh material or as detritus. A comparison with a positive estuary (i.e., Sabine-Neches estuary, TX) indicates that decreases in freshwater inflow may lead to decreases of terrestrial organic matter inputs and to increase the ratio of autochtonous phytoplanktonic material in SPOM.

T2  - GEOBIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - One hundred and twenty-one samples were collected in three estuaries of the Huelva littoral (SW Spain). The 12,923 individuals picked were assigned to forty-seven species. The analysis of the foraminiferal percentages allows the distinction of seven assemblages: two salt marsh assemblages (Trochammina inflata and Jadammina macrescens), four assemblages widely represented both in the channel margins and the channels (Ammonia inflata Astrononion stelligerum, Cribroelphidium vadescens, Ammonia ammoniformis) and one marginal marine assemblage (Ammonia beccarii-Quinqueloculina spp). The distribution of these assemblages is controlled by the salinity, the altitude above the lowest tidal level and, to a lesser extent, by the grain size, organic matter and the test transport. In the Tinto-Odiel estuary, both effects of heavy metal pollution and sedimentary changes in the foraminiferal distribution were analyzed, indicating some recuperation mainly in the Odiel river, one of the most polluted areas of the world.

TI  - Terrestrial-marine connectivity: Patterns of terrestrial soil carbon deposition in coastal sediments determined by analysis of glomalin related soil protein
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glomalin, an arbuscular mycorrhizal protein component of soil, can be used as an indicator of terrigenous-derived carbon. We measured glomalin in sediments using the terrestrial end-member as a reference in four coastal settings: (1) intertidal seagrass meadows distributed over a rainfall gradient, (2) sediments inshore and offshore from the mouth of a river, (3) coastal coral reefs at various distances from the shore, and (4) intertidal wetlands with varying levels of groundwater influence. Across the rainfall gradient, glomalin in seagrass meadow sediments increased at sites with high mean annual rainfall during the wet season (r(2) = 0.27; F-1,F-29 = 5.75; p = 0.029). Glomalin decreased in inshore river sediments (terrestrial) to offshore (marine) sediments (r(2) = 0.81; F-1,F-17 = 71.7; p <= 0.0001). Furthermore, glomalin in reef sediments decreased with distance from the shore. The high intertidal was rich in glomalin where groundwater flowed directly into the wetland compared with those with little groundwater influences. Our data indicate that rivers and groundwater transport terrestrial material, and that mangroves, salt marsh, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs accumulate it, but the connections vary among sites, within sites, and seasonally. Variations in glomalin concentrations are indicative of links between the terrestrial and marine environment that reflect proximity, filtration services, and the level of subsidies that marine ecosystems derive from terrestrial sources. Assessment of glomalin contributes to evaluating terrestrial-marine connectivity, and thus provides knowledge to improve catchment management for the protection of marine ecosystems.

AB  - Knowledge about geochemical fractions of vanadium (V) in different soils is required to understand its potential mobilization which we assessed in thirteen soil profiles originating from Germany and Egypt using the sequential extraction technique of the Commission of the European Communities Bureau of Reference (BCR). The concentrations of total, AB-DTPA-extractable, and the geochemical fractions [acid soluble (F1), reducible (F2), oxidisable (F3), and residual (F4) fraction] of V in the soils were determined. The total V concentrations ranged from 20.7 to 133.1 mg kg(-1) and correlated positively with clay content and the total concentrations of iron (Fe-t), aluminum (Al-t), and manganese (Mn-t). The total V was stronger affected by free Fe and Mn oxides (Fe-d and Mn-d) in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils. The residual fraction of V was dominant in the soils followed by the reducible and the oxidisable fraction and showed a similar behavior to total V. The reducible V was higher in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils and was positively correlated with Fe-t, Al-t, Mn-t, Fe-d, and Mn-d. The impact of Fe-t, Al-t, and Mn-t on the reducible V was stronger in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils, while the impact of Fe-d and Mn-d on the reducible V was stronger in the German soils than Egyptian soils. The oxidisable V was affected by soil organic matter and total sulphur (S-t) in the German soils and by carbonates and S-t in the Egyptian soils. The acid soluble fraction of V was lower than the detection limits in all soils. The AB-DTPA-extractable V concentrations (potential available V) ranged between 0.04 and 4.04 mg kg(-1). The potential mobile fraction (PMF = Sigma F1-F3) accounted 4.4-64.7% of the total V. The alkaline soils showed the highest potential mobility and availability of V compared to the acidic soils, and thus the AB-DTPA-extractable V correlated positively with soil pH as well as clay content, cation exchange capacity, and Fe-t. The reducible fraction contributed stronger to the potential mobility and availability of V than the oxidisable fraction. The canonical discrimination analysis explained 64% of the variability of the geochemical behavior of the different soil groups and showed that the different groups of soils could differentiate from each other. The German soil groups (Eutric Fluvisols, Calcic Luvisols, Tidalic Fluvisol and Haplic Gleysol (Marsh soils)), showed a different geochemical behavior; while the Egyptian Eutric Fluvisols and Sodic Fluvisols were relatively similar in their geochemical behavior and the Haplic Calcisols was relatively close to them. Our results demonstrate that the potential mobilization of V was high in the soils (except for Luvisols) - especially under alkaline conditions-which indicate a release of this toxic metal from the soils to soil solution. This release may cause potential environmental risks such as the transfer of V into the groundwater, the vegetation and food chain. Future studies should elucidate the temporal kinetics of V and the determining factors under different flooding conditions and remediation approaches are necessary to ameliorate V-contaminated soils.

TI  - Assessing the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on labile and recalcitrant C and N pools by means of soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - An exotic grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to Jiuduansha wetlands in Yangtze River estuary in 1997, and since then it had rapidly replaced native plant Scirpus mariqueter that used to dominate the estuarine salt marshes. We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

TI  - Can we manage coastal ecosystems to sequester more blue carbon?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To promote the sequestration of blue carbon, resource managers rely on best-management practices that have historically included protecting and restoring vegetated coastal habitats (seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves), but are now beginning to incorporate catchment-level approaches. Drawing upon knowledge from a broad range of environmental variables that influence blue carbon sequestration, including warming, carbon dioxide levels, water depth, nutrients, runoff, bioturbation, physical disturbances, and tidal exchange, we discuss three potential management strategies that hold promise for optimizing coastal blue carbon sequestration: (1) reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs, (2) reinstating top-down control of bioturbator populations, and (3) restoring hydrology. By means of case studies, we explore how these three strategies can -minimize blue carbon losses and maximize gains. A key research priority is to more accurately quantify the impacts of these strategies on atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions in different settings at landscape scales.

TI  - Organic matter sources for tidal marsh sediment over the past two millennia in the Minho River estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 25th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry (IMOG)
CL  - Interlaken, SWITZERLAND
AB  - Environmental changes during the last 2 millennia in the Minho River tidal marsh (NW Portugal-Spain border) were reconstructed. Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

AB  - In salty marsh bay Dirty (White sea) are distinguished two belts differed by the characteristics of medium and by the species composition of organisms. Aloft of salt marsh predominate plants forming dense grass sod, balking the development of burrowing animals, below - in thin plant, cover - dominate invertebrates. On the whole the distribution of plants has more expressed zone al character, than invertebrates (randomly-mosaic). In spring distribution of invertebrates is connected by principal image with maregraphic level, by the composite of ground and by the content of organic matter. At the end summer also essentially increases the role of vegetation cover. In the process seasonal succession noticeably grows the community integration. In spring distinctly are distinguished several vegetably-animals of associations having randomly-mosaic distribution on littoral. To autumn formation common vegetably-bestial association including most dominate species salty marsh.

TI  - Sources, bioavailabitity, and photoreactivity of dissolved organic carbon in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed bioavailability, photoreactivity, fluorescence, and isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) collected at 13 stations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta during various seasons to estimate the persistence of DOC from diverse shallow water habitat sources. Prospective large-scale wetland restorations in the Delta may change the amount of DOC available to the food web as well as change the quality of Delta water exported for municipal use. Our study indicates that DOC contributed by Delta sources is relatively refractory and likely mostly the dissolved remnants of vascular plant material from degrading soils and tidal marshes rather than phytoplankton production. Therefore, the prospective conversion of agricultural land into submerged, phytoplankton-dominated habitats may reduce the undesired export of DOC from the Delta to municipal users. A median of 10% of Delta DOC was rapidly utilizable by bacterioplankton. A moderate dose of simulated solar radiation (286 W m(-2) for 4 h) decreased the DOC bioavailability by an average of 40%, with a larger relative decrease in samples with higher initial DOC bioavailability. Potentially, a DOC-based microbial food web could support <= 0.6 x 10(9) g C of protist production in the Delta annually, compared to approximate to 17 x 10(9) g C phytoplankton primary production. Thus, DOC utilization via the microbial food web is unlikely to play an important role in the nutrition of Delta zooplankton and fish, and the possible decrease in DOC concentration due to wetland restoration is unlikely to have a direct effect on Delta fish productivity.

TI  - Ecophysiological adaptations of two halophytes to salt stress: Photosynthesis, PS II photochemistry and anti-oxidant feedback - Implications for resilience in climate change
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocomia fruticosa commonly exhibit a reddish coloration especially in high evaporation periods, due to betacyanin production in response to stress. Although sharing the same area in salt marshes, they present different strategies to overcome salinity stress. While S. fruticosa present a dilution strategy, increasing succulence, H. portulacoides appears to have developed an ionic compartmentalization strategy. Nevertheless, there's still a decrease in the photosynthetic activity in different extents. While in S. fruticosa, the impairment of photosynthetic activity is due to a decrease in the flow from the electron transport chain to the quinone pool; in H. portulacoides the process is affected far more early, with high amounts of energy dissipated at the PSII light harvesting centers. This photosynthetic impairment leads to energy accumulation and consequently to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). SOD was particularly active in stressed individuals, although this increment is rather more significant in S. fruticosa than in H. portulacoides suggesting that H. portulacoides may have a maximum salt concentration at which can sustain cellular balance between ROS production and scavenging. These different ecophysiological responses have great importance while evaluating the impacts climate change driven increase of sediment salinity on halophyte physiology and on the marsh community and ecosystem services.

TI  - Responses of bacterial assemblages on standing-decaying blades of smooth cordgrass to additions of water and nitrogen
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plots of intermediate-height cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) were fertilized with nitrogen, misted with freshwater, given both misting and N, or left untreated. Bacterial responses on standing-decaying leaf blades were measured as changes in epiphytic mass, rates of shedding of bacterial cells into seawater, and rates of net growth on blades. Epiphytic mass rose with time, and it did so 6-fold more sharply for the combination of fertilization and misting than for control. Since the sediment surface would offer higher N and water availability, this may indicate that movement of leaf material to marsh sediments would strongly favor bacterial activity. Net growth on aerially incubated (15 h), wet blades as percentage of standing bacterial mass was unchanging with duration of decay period, but was affected by treatment (about 0 to +5% h(-1) for misted treatments, +15% h(-1) for unmisted treatments). Faster growth on newly wetted, unmisted blades may have been due to release of cells from growth limitation by desiccation. Plot treatment did not affect specific rate of bacterial shedding (about 8% of standing bacterial epiphytic mass during one h of submergence at 4 weeks, and 149% h(-1) at 12 weeks). It may be that during high spring tides, bacterial shedding from standing-decaying blades could provide numbers of new cells in the water column near to or greater than those provided by division of bacterioplanktonic cells.

T2  - Environmental Data Initiative
M3  - Data set
AB  - Stable isotopes of primary producers will be compared to stable isotopes of functional groups of organisms at primarily three sites within the estuary that have different dominant sources of organic matter.The three sites are: Lower (IBYC, SO-3, mouth of Plum Island Sound, 2-3 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary), Middle (OTL, PR-10.1, upper Sound, lower Parker, 8-11 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary) and Upper (P2, PR-21.9, upper Parker, above Middle Rd Bridge (22 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary). The Lower site is dominated by marine phytoplankton, the Middle site is dominated by a mixture of salt marsh and phytoplankton and the Upper site is dominated by oligohaline phytoplankton and fresh marsh.Ten functional groups will be sampled at each site (Surface sediment, benthic diatoms, Nereis, mummichog, ribbed mussels, POM, blue mussels, pelagic copepods (Acartia), silversides and soft shell clams (Mya). Marsh, benthic algae and phytoplankton inputs or benthic vs. pelagic pathways will be evident in the isotopic signals of these functional groups. Samples will be collected between the middle and end of August to reflect a growing season using recently produced OM. Samples of 15 - 20 individuals will be pooled for analysis. Some silverside samplings will have 3 different pooled samples for determination of variance. Often times the same species are not collected at each site due to habitat differences (salinity/discharge) so additional species are collected to try to accomplish task of getting functional groups collected.

TI  - Uncertainty propagation in an ecosystem nutrient budget
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - New aspects and advancements in classical uncertainty propagation methods were used to develop a nutrient budget with associated uncertainty for a northern Gulf of Mexico coastal embayment. Uncertainty was calculated for budget terms by propagating the standard error and degrees of freedom. New aspects include the combined use of Monte Carlo simulations with classical error propagation methods, uncertainty analyses for GIS computations, and uncertainty propagation involving literature and subjective estimates of terms used in the budget calculations. The methods employed are broadly applicable to the mathematical operations employed in ecological studies involving step-by-step calculations, scaling procedures, and calculations of variables from direct measurements and/or literature estimates. Propagation of the standard error and the degrees of freedom allowed for calculation of the uncertainty intervals around every term in the budget. For scientists and environmental managers, the methods developed herein provide a relatively simple framework to propagate and assess the contributions of uncertainty in directly measured and literature estimated variables to calculated variables. Application of these methods to environmental data used in scientific reporting and environmental management will improve the interpretation of data and simplify the estimation of risk associated with decisions based on ecological studies.

TI  - The carbon balance of grazed and non-grazed Spartina anglica saltmarshes at Skallingen, Denmark
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1 Canopy-level CO2 exchange and biomass were measured monthly for 9 consecutive months during 1990 on grazed and non-grazed portions of a Danish salt marsh dominated by Spartina anglica. The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.

TI  - Sustainable management of Australia's coastal seascapes: a case for collecting and communicating quantitative evidence to inform decision-making
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia's developed coasts are a heavily competed space, subject to urban, industrial and agricultural development. A diversity of habitats, such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses, comprise Australia's coastal seascape and provide numerous benefits including fish productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, coastal protection and recreation. Decision makers need to be able to weigh up the relative costs and benefits of coastal development, protection or repair and to do this they need robust, accessible and defensible data on the ecological function and economic value of Australia's coastal seascapes. We reviewed the published literature, with a focus on saltmarsh as a vulnerable ecological community, to determine the availability of information on key ecological functions that could inform ecosystem service valuation. None of the publications we reviewed quantified nutrient cycling, coastal protection or recreation functions. Only 13 publications presented quantitative information on carbon sequestration and fish productivity. These were limited geographically, with the majority of studies on sub-tropical and temperate saltmarsh communities between south-east Queensland and Victoria. This demonstrates a lack of quantitative information needed to substantiate and communicate the value of Australia's saltmarshes in different locations, scales and contexts. Research should focus on addressing these knowledge gaps and communicating evidence in a relevant form and context for decision-making. We discuss four principles for research funding organisations and researchers to consider when prioritising and undertaking research on key ecological functions of Australia's saltmarshes, and coastal seascapes more broadly, to support sustainable coastal development, protection and repair for long-term economic and community benefit.

TI  - Can greening of aquaculture sequester blue carbon?
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions have been seriously augmented due to the devastating effects of anthropogenic pressures on coastal ecosystems including mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The greening of aquaculture, however, including an ecosystem approach to Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) and Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) could play a significant role in reversing this trend, enhancing coastal ecosystems, and sequestering blue carbon. Ponds within IAA farming systems sequester more carbon per unit area than conventional fish ponds, natural lakes, and inland seas. The translocation of shrimp culture from mangrove swamps to offshore IMTA could reduce mangrove loss, reverse blue carbon emissions, and in turn increase storage of blue carbon through restoration of mangroves. Moreover, offshore IMTA may create a barrier to trawl fishing which in turn could help restore seagrasses and further enhance blue carbon sequestration. Seaweed and shellfish culture within IMTA could also help to sequester more blue carbon. The greening of aquaculture could face several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize substantial benefits from enhanced blue carbon sequestration and eventually contribute to global climate change mitigation.

TI  - Macrofaunal succession and community structure in Salicornia marshes of southern California
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of basic understanding of ecosystem structure and function forms a major impediment to successful conservation of coastal ecosystems. This paper provides a description of the fauna and examines faunal succession in Salicornia-vegetated sediments of southern California. Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) and macrofaunal (animals greater than or equal to 0.3 mm) community structure were examined in sediments of five natural, southern California Salicornia spp. marshes (Tijuana Estuary, San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Anaheim Bay) and in created Salicornia marshes 16 months to 10 years in age, located within four of the bays. Oligochaetes and insects were the dominant taxa in both natural (71 to 98% of total fauna) and created (91 to 97%) marshes. In San Diego, Newport and Anaheim Bays, macrofaunal densities were generally higher in the created marshes (88 000 to 290 000 ind m(-2)) than in their natural counterparts (26 000 to 50 000 ind m(-2)). In the youngest system, Mission Bay, the reverse was true (natural: 113 000 vs created: 28 000 ind m-2). Similar species numbers were recorded from the created and adjacent natural marshes. Insects, especially chironomids, dolichopodids, and heleids, as well as the naidid oligochaete, Paranais litoralis, characterize early successional stages. Enchytraeid and tubificid oligochaetes reflect later succession evident in natural and older created marshes. Sediment organic matter (both combustible and below-ground plant biomass) was the environmental variable most commonly associated with densities of various macrofaunal taxa. These relationships were generally negative in the natural marshes and positive in the created marshes. Within-bay comparisons of macrofauna from natural Salicornia- vs Spartina-vegetated habitat in San Diego and Mission Bays revealed lower macrofaunal density (San Diego Bay only), proportionally fewer oligochaetes and more insects, and no differences in species richness in the Salicornia habitat. The oldest created Salicornia marsh (San Diego Bay) exhibited an assemblage intermediate in composition between those of the natural Salicornia- and Spartina-vegetated marshes. These results suggest: (a) faunal recovery following Salicornia marsh creation can require 10 or more years, (b) high macrofaunal variability among bays requires marsh creation reference site selection from within the same bay, and (c) Spartina-based research should not be used for Salicornia marsh management decisions.

TI  - Disturbance is complicated: Headward-eroding saltmarsh creeks produce multiple responses and recovery trajectories
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Disturbances are one of the most important processes affecting natural systems, but there is a gap between simple conceptual models of disturbance and complex empirical studies. We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation. Our study illustrates the challenges in moving from simple conceptual models of disturbance to empirical studies in which multiple variables are likely to be affected differently and follow different recovery trajectories.

TI  - COASTAL METABOLISM AND THE OCEANIC ORGANIC-CARBON BALANCE
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Net organic metabolism (that is, the difference between primary production and respiration of organic matter) in the coastal ocean may be a significant term in the oceanic carbon budget. Historical change in the rate of this net metabolism determines the importance of the coastal ocean relative to anthropogenic perturbations of the global carbon cycle. Consideration of long-term rates of river loading of organic carbon, organic burial, chemical reactivity of land-derived organic matter, and rates of community metabolism in the coastal zone leads us to estimate that the coastal zone oxidizes about 7 x 10(12) moles C/yr. The open ocean is apparently also a site of net organic oxidation (approximately 16 x 10(12) moles C/yr). Thus organic metabolism in the ocean appears to be a source Of CO2 release to the atmosphere rather than being a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The small area of the coastal ocean accounts for about 30% of the net oceanic oxidation. Oxidation in the coastal zone (especially in bays and estuaries) takes on particular importance, because the input rate is likely to have been altered substantially by human activities on land.

TI  - Sediment (grain size and clay mineralogy) and organic matter quality control on living benthic foraminifera
T2  - Revue de Micropaleontologie
M3  - Article
AB  - The paleoccological interpretation of fossil foraminiferal assemblages depends on an understanding of the ecological processes operating at the present. This study investigates both the quality of organic matter (OM) by elemental analysis as well as the sediment grain size and clay mineralogy to understand their relative influence on distribution and abundance of benthic foraminifera. This study is carried out on 15 samples regularly spaced from the mudflat to the tidal marsh. The results indicate that grain size is the most limiting parameter. Living (stained) benthic foraminiferal density and species richness are both very low within coarser sediments. OM is the second limiting factor. The density of foraminifera. is the lowest and the species richness is the highest with the lowest organic carbon (C-org) contents and C/N < 12. Conversely, when the C-org is very high and C/N > 12, the density is high and the species richness medium. A high smectite proportion within the clay-size fraction seems to favor the development of Miliammina fitsca. Trochammina inflata and Jadammina macrescens are both favored by an increase of organic carbon proportion but Trochammina inflata preferentially feeds on algal-derived OM when compared with Jadammina macrescens.

TI  - Relating daily solar ultraviolet radiation dose in salt marsh-associated estuarine systems to laboratory assessments of photoactivated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries of the southeastern United States not only serve an important nursery function but also are common repositories of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from upland activities. Thus, these habitats may be at risk for PAH phototoxicity. To better characterize this risk, a daily survey of ultraviolet-A (UV-A; 320-400 nm) irradiance was performed at Leadenwah Creek (Wadmalaw Island, SC, USA) on June 27 and August 1, 2003. In addition, laboratory assays were completed using two light exposure regimes: One that was typical of historical phototoxicity assessments (continuous light [C-UV]), and a more environmentally realistic regime (ER-UV). On both survey days, irradiance at a depth of 10 cm exhibited a pattern generally similar to that observed at the surface, whereas irradiance at the bottom of the creek was a function of both tidal height and time of day. Total UV-A dose at a 10-cm depth on June 27 and August 1, 2003 was 4.37 and 4.78 J/cm(2), respectively. Attenuation coefficients on both days varied as a function of tidal height. In the laboratory, larval grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) exposed to an ER-UV regime for these habitats (photoperiod, 12:12-h light:dark; total daily UV-A dose, 4.40 J/cm(2)) exhibited a 2.5-fold decrease in toxicity compared with those exposed to the C-UV regime (photoperiod, 24:0-h light:dark; total daily UV dose, 1.50 J/cm(2)), despite a threefold higher UV dose in the ER-UV regime. The lower potency under the ER-UV regime likely is attributable to the presence of a 12-h dark period allowing for recovery. The consequences of these results are discussed in the context of habitat-specific UV-A dose and its relevance to future laboratory assessments of PAH phototoxicity.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on the Challenges in Environmental Science and Engineering (CESE)

AB  - The soil microbial respiration (SMR) and physicochemical characteristics of Jiuduansha wetland at the Yangtze Estuary were analyzed in order to clarify the variability of SMR under different vegetation succession stages and its influencing factors. The results indicated that SMR of different vegetation succession stages are significantly various (P < 0.05). The SMR of the Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) zone (0.43 mgCO(2).g(-1).24h(-1)) was the highest. These findings implied that S. alterniflora could enhance the SMR. Based on both the SMR and input of organic matter from plant decay, the Phragmites australis (P. australis) community likely possesses a higher organic carbon accumulation capability. Considering both SMR and input of organic matter from decayed plant biomass of wetland with different vegetation type, the P. australis community, in theory, has higher organic carbon accumulation capability. Path analysis shows that the main bio-factors influencing on SMR include bacterial diversity and soil microbial biomass (SMB). Soil moisture, inorganic N (IN), salinity and available P (AP) in soil also have significant effects on the mentioned biological factors.

TI  - Patterns and bioavailability of soil nutrients and carbon across a gradient of inundation frequencies in a lowland river channel, Murray-Darling Basin, Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of both carbon and nutrient stores in the landscape is not homogeneous, and is influenced by soil properties such as texture and organic content as well as spatial gradients such as inundation frequency. In this study the distribution of water extractable soil nutrients and water mobile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its bioavailability were investigated at specific levels along a cross-sectional gradient that extended from the baseflow level deep in the channel to the floodplain. The frequency with which these specific levels are inundated was modelled under three flow regimes to determine if flow change is likely to influence nutrient supply to the river. Soil surface litter and soil organic carbon content, DOC and SRP increased along a trajectory from the base of the channel onto the floodplain. Ammonium increased and nitrate decreased as in-channel height decreased. This reflects an increase in soil inundation frequency lower in the channel decreasing nitrification rates and increasing NO3- losses via mobilisation and denitrification. Bioavailable soil DOC (BDOC) was lowest in the most frequently inundated soils; however, overall soil BDOC did not relate to either changing soil properties or inundation frequency. There were no significant differences in nutrient and carbon supply to the river under the three modelled flow regimes (with flows extraction rules, without flow extraction rules and natural flows) explored as flow change was most marked in the channel bed region, where little organic matter was stored.

TI  - Dynamics of phosphorus speciation and the phoD phosphatase gene community in the rhizosphere and bulk soil along an estuarine freshwater-oligohaline gradient
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes play a key role in phosphorus (P) retention and cycling; however, they are suffering from small but significant increases in tidal saltwater intrusion. The likely impacts of these low-level saltwater intrusions on P availability and microbial activity are unclear. Here, we investigated soil P speciation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the phoD phosphatase gene community along a freshwater-oligohaline gradient in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The results indicated that with the transition from freshwater to oligohaline water, the levels of soil-water salinity, pH and sulfate content were greater, and ALP activity was lower, which were associated with higher concentrations of organic P, available P, aluminum-bound P, calciumbound P, and occluded P and lower levels of iron-bound P. There was a strong shift in the phoD phosphatase community composition in response to the freshwater-oligohaline gradient. Our findings showed that with the transition from freshwater to an oligohaline environment, in addition to the associated increases in salinity and soil pH and decreases in general microbial and biological activity and soil organic carbon, there is a shift in soil P toward more recalcitrant and immediately available fractions with less labile forms.

TI  - Spectral Irradiance, Phytoplankton Community Composition and Primary Productivity in a Salt Marsh Estuary, North Inlet, South Carolina, USA
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated spatial and temporal changes in spectral irradiance, phytoplankton community composition, and primary productivity in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA. High concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were responsible for up to 84 % of the attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). Green-yellow wavelengths were the predominant colors of light available at the two sampling sites: Clam Bank Creek and Oyster Landing. Vertical attenuation coefficients of PAR were 0.7-2.1 m(-1) with corresponding euphotic zone depths of 1.5-6.7 m. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a [chl a]) varied seasonally with a summer maximum of 16 mu g chl a l(-1) and a winter minimum of 1.4 mu g chl a l(-1). The phytoplankton community consisted mainly of diatoms, prasinophytes, cryptophytes and haptophytes, with diatoms and prasinophytes accounting for up to 67 % of total chl a. Changes in phytoplankton community composition showed strongest correlations with temperature. Light-saturated chl a-specific rates of photosynthesis and daily primary productivity varied with season and ranged from 1.6 to 14 mg C (mg chl a) (-1) h(-1) (32-803 mg C m(-3) day(-1)). Calculated daily rates added up to an annual carbon fixation rate of 84 g C m(-3) year(-1). Overall, changes in phytoplankton community composition and primary productivity in North Inlet showed a strong dependence on temperature, with PAR and spectral irradiance playing a relatively minor role due to short residence times, strong tidal forcing and vertical mixing.

T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pore-waters from two boxcores from the Oman Margin, from sites NIOP484 and NIOP487 (respectively in and below the oxygen minimum zone in the water column), were analysed for concentrations of iodide, sulphide, thiosulphate, phosphate, silica, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, dissolved iron, dissolved manganese and dissolved sulphur. In addition, the solid phase of samples from the same cores was analysed for organic carbon, pyritic sulphur, acid volatile sulphide, elemental sulphur, organic polysulphides, humic sulphur, reactive iron phases and reactive manganese phases. Pore-water profiles show that post-oxic diagenesis dominates in these Holocene sediments. Only minor amounts of reduced sulphur species were found in pore-waters, despite the low oxygen concentration of the bottom-water and the relatively high organic-matter content of the sediments. Significant amounts of solid-phase reduced sulphur were only found in the lower half of the boxcore at station NIOP484. Consequently, sulphate reduction is not as significant in these sediments relative to sediments from other upwelling areas, and thus more sedimentary organic matter is preserved.

TI  - Changes in the elemental (C, N) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) composition of estuarine plants during diagenesis and implications for ecological studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotopes have been used to quantify the contributions of plant-derived detritus in nutrient cycling and energy flow based on the assumption that mixtures reflect the isotopic composition of their sources. However, during the decay process, the plant detritus carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures may vary from that of the original plant material. This fractionation during plant decomposition may impose limitations on the interpretation of results based on the stable isotopes approach. Studies investigating this process for estuarine primary producers have shown contrasting results, and for some producers, they are still scarce. The present study investigated the temporal variations in the elemental (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratios) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions of C-3 and C-4 salt marsh plants (Scitpus maritimus and Spartina densiflora, respectively), seagrass (Ruppia maritima) and opportunistic macroalgae (Rhizoclonium sp.) during decomposition. For this purpose, an in situ experiment using litterbag incubations was conducted in a shallow water ( < 2 m) estuarine site over twelve weeks to investigate the plant decomposition process under the natural variability of environmental conditions (i.e., freshwater discharge, dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, water salinity and temperature). Our results indicated that detritus biomass and nutrient mineralization rates varied among the different estuarine plant species. Overall decreases in the C:N ratios primarily resulted from total organic carbon losses. However, low variations in delta C-13 ( < 2 parts per thousand) were detected, possibly due to the short-term duration of our study. The observed lack of significant changes in total nitrogen content and the small changes in N-15 values during plant material degradation suggests, to some extent, N-limitation of microbial growth. The observed low levels of isotopic fractionation during decomposition support the usefulness of stable isotopes as natural tracers of organic matter. Nonetheless, to investigate the effects of several environmental and biotic factors on nutrient isotopic fractionation during plant decay and their implications for ecological studies, we emphasize the need for further experimental studies performed under distinct environmental conditions.

TI  - Rolling covenants to protect coastal ecosystems in the face of sea-level rise
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers how "rolling covenants" (i.e., covenants on land title that can operate in a "rolling" geographic area to keep pace with sea-level rise) can be used to permit productive use of land in the short term, while ensuring land use can shift over time to allow for coastal ecosystem migration in the medium to long term. We use Australia as a case study, and through analysis of legislation and a series of semistructured interviews, we demonstrate how land title-based covenants can be used to give legal effect to "rolling covenant" arrangements where land is subject to existing use and occupation. We then consider practical issues associated with drafting a rolling covenant arrangement, including an analysis of the types of events or scenarios that could be used as a basis for land use changing (e.g., projected sea-level rise, actual ecosystem migration), and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We conclude that rolling covenants are a viable option for land management in the coastal zone, especially in circumstances where funding sources are available to incentivize uptake. Rolling covenants may provide opportunities for coastal wetlands to be maintained and even enhanced in cover, thereby delivering important ecosystem services (e.g., blue carbon) into the future.

TI  - PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL OF MINERAL MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS AS A SOIL PARTICLE SIZE PROXY
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of mineral magnetic concentration parameters (chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM) as a potential particle size proxy for soil samples collected from the Isle of Man (British Isles) is explored as an alternative means of normalizing particle size effects. Comparison of soil-related analytical data by correlation analyses between each magnetic parameter and individual particle size classes (i.e. sand, silt and clay), more discrete intervals within classes (e.g. rule sand or medium silt) and cumulative size fractions (e.g. clay + fine silt) are reported. Both chi(LF) and chi(ARM) parameters reveal significant (p <0.05; n = 46), but relatively weak (r(s) = 0.297 and 0.369), associations with clay content, while X-LF, chi(ARM) and SIRM parameters have no significant relationship with sand and silt content or any discrete or CLullUlatiVC size fractions. Contrary to earlier research Findings. this indicates that magnetic measurements are not always a suitable particle size proxy and it is only certain environments and/or specific settings that are appropriate for granulometric normalization by this technique. However, if future researchers working in other soil settings can identify a formal predictable relationship. the technique is known to offer it simple, reliable, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and non-destructive approach that Could lie a valuable particle size proxy for normalizing particle size effects in Soil contamination Studies.

TI  - Accumulation of total trace metals due to rapid urbanization in microtidal zone of Pallikaranai marsh, South of Chennai, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results for enrichment of total trace metals (TTMs) from Pallikaranai salt marsh in South Chennai, a metropolis on the southeast coast of India. TTMs Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Sr, V, and Hg along with sediment texture, OC, and CaCO(3) were analyzed in 36 surface sediments collected during August 2008 to recognize and observe the input of TTMs in the marsh from various sources in the city limits. In view of the rapid urbanization and industrialization in Chennai City, especially on the southern side, uncontrolled input of sewage, garbage, and industrial effluents into the Pallikaranai marsh land, the elevated concentrations are not surprising. The level of enrichment of TTMs has also increased by 20% to 60% for most of the elements when compared with all other ecosystems in the world as well as the nearby area. The results also indicate that the marshy region is more heavily contaminated with Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn than other regions on the southeast coast of India. The Enrichment Factor, Contamination Factor, and I (geo) indexes are calculated, and these values are useful to assess the degree of pollution in sediments. The spatial distributions of TTMs are also controlled by other factors like geochemical, precipitation, and flocculation of particulate substances in the marsh. The results of the present study suggest the need for a regular monitoring and management program which will help to improve the quality of Pallikaranai pristine marsh land.

TI  - Distribution Patterns and Pollution Assessments of Heavy Metals in the Spartina alterniflora Salt-Marsh Wetland of Rudong, Jiangsu Province
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the ecological impact of Spartina alterniflora on the coastal wetland environment, field survey was carried out in July, 2010, over the intertidal areas of Rudong coast, Jiangsu province; sediment samples were collected from a series of stations with different conditions of vegetation cover and S. alterniflora growth. The contents of eight heavy metals, together with sediment composition and total organic carbon were analyzed to reveal the distribution patterns of the heavy metals. Environmental quality status was evaluated using both the index of geoaccumulation (I-geo) and the index of the Hakanson ecological risk. The analytical results showed that the average contents of Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were below the standard for the Category I sediment quality, among which Cd, Hg, Ni and Zn exceeded the sediment background value of the region. On the whole, the contents of eight heavy metals in vegetation areas were higher than those associated with the adjacent bare flat areas. These data sets indicate a non-polluted condition in term of I-geo estimation; however, a critical state of low to moderate degrees of pollution and a low level of risk were deduced according to the index of the Hakanson potential ecological risk. Both indices suggested that the pollution level of Hg and Cd were the highest among the eight metals measured. Along the transection from seaward to landward, the contents of As, Cu and Hg, their indices of Igeo and Hakanson ecological risk all showed an increasing tread, in accordance with the condition of vegetation cover. Along the coastline with S. alterniflora being distributed in patchiness, all metal contents and their ecological risk level values for the marshes were higher than those for the unvegetated sediments nearby; moreover, except for Hg, other seven metals exhibited relatively low values than those in the shore-normal section with a better S. alterniflora growth. These findings indicate that S. alterniflora is one of important factors to enrich the heavy metal in tidal flat sediment. Thus, ecological risk of the heavy metal is reduced or blocked, due to the filtering effect of salt-marsh, which prevents metals from entering the open sea directly. The distribution of heavy metal is influenced by a combination of colonization time of vegetation, chemical form of metals and their origins.

TI  - Methane distribution and methane oxidation in the water column of the Elbe estuary, Germany
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The River Elbe, as one of the major waterways of central Europe, is a potential source of high amounts of methane into the North Sea. Twelve sampling cruises from October 2010 until June 2013 were conducted from Hamburg towards the mouth of the Elbe at Cuxhaven. The dynamic of methane concentrations in the water column and its consumption via methane oxidizing bacteria was measured. In addition, physico-chemical parameters were used to estimate their influence on the methanotrophic activity. We observed high methane concentrations at the stations in the area of Hamburg harbour ("upper estuary'') and about 10 times lower concentrations in the lower estuary (median of 416 versus 40 nmol L-1, respectively). The methane oxidation rate mirrored the methane distribution with high values in the upper estuary and low values in the lower estuary (median of 161 versus 10 nmol L-1 day(-1), respectively). Methane concentrations were significantly influenced by the river hydrology (falling water level) and the biological oxygen demand while interestingly, no clear relation to the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was found. Methane oxidation rates were significantly influenced by methane concentration and to a lesser extent by temperature. Methane oxidation accounted for 41 +/- 12 % of the total loss of methane in summer/fall periods, but for only 5 +/- 3 % of the total loss in the winter/spring periods (total loss = methane oxidation ? diffusion into the atmosphere). The average sea-air flux of methane was 33 +/- 8 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1). We applied a box model taking into account the residence times of each water parcel depending on discharge and tidal impact. We observed almost stable methane concentrations in the lower estuary, despite a strong loss of methane through diffusion and oxidation. Thus we postulate that losses in the lower Elbe estuary were balanced by additional inputs of methane, possibly from extensive salt marshes near the river mouth.

TI  - Trophic ecology of mullets during their spring migration in a European saltmarsh: A stable isotope study
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mullet populations are abundant in littoral waters throughout the world and play a significant role in organic matter fluxes. Mullets are opportunistic feeders: adults have frequently been shown to feed on primary producers (e.g. fresh or detrital plant material, microphytobenthos) but they may also feed on meiofauna. The population structure and stomach contents of mullets that colonize saltmarsh creeks in Aiguillon Bay (French Atlantic coast) were studied to determine if they use saltmarshes as a feeding ground in spring. Stable isotope analyses were carried out on mullets sampled to assess their diet during their spring migration. The mullet population was primarily composed of young-of-the-year (G0), 1 year-old (G1) of both Liza ramada and Liza aurata species and 3 year-old or older (G3+) L ramada individuals. G0 and G3+ population densities increased during the spring period: catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased from 0.22 to 1.49 ind min(-1) for the GO age group; but stomach content analyses revealed that only G1 and G3+ feed in the saltmarsh. Isotopic signatures of G1 (spring: delta(13)C: -14.8 parts per thousand delta(15)N: 14.1 parts per thousand) and G3+ mullets (spring: delta(13)C: -16.9 parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 13.8 parts per thousand) indicate that mullet growth is supported largely by primary consumers, such as benthic meiofauna or small macrofauna. Mullets are thus positioned at a much higher trophic level than true primary consumers. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of glyphosate and imazamox on the control of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The south-American cordgrass, Spartina densiflora, has become the dominant plant species on recent tidal marsh restorations in the Donana National Park (SW Spain). We examined the effect of different doses of glyphosate (720-7200 ga.i.ha(-1)) and imazamox (20-68 ga.i.ha(-1)) on growth and photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora. Imazamox had no effect on neither on growth nor photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora. On the contrary, glyphosate inhibited photochemical efficiency of photosynthesis from day one. Net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic pigments and the number of new tillers were reduced. Glyphosate at high doses (ca. 7200 g.a.i. ha(-1)) could be an appropriate method of control, since it has a negative effect over the photosynthetic apparatus and growth of S. densiflora. Furthermore, glyphosate and its main metabolite, AMPA, were not extracted from the soil, since they were retained by the very high iron and aluminum oxide content of this soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Habitat-specific food webs and trophic interactions supporting coastal-dependent fishery species: an Australian case study
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as estuaries, tidal wetlands and shallow coastal waters are often highly productive and provide important habitats to many recreationally and commercially important fish and invertebrates that use these areas as nursery, feeding and/or reproduction grounds. The diversity of coastlines found worldwide results in differences in types of provisioning and function, and in community structure and trophic organisation. Since almost all coastal fishery species require particular components of the seascapes during specific stages of their life-cycles, it is important to understand the way fish use different habitats throughout ontogeny. Access to rich feeding environments is a key contributor to habitat value, and so knowledge on food webs and feeding relationships, and how these vary over space and time, is central to understanding the importance of the different coastal environments. However, the functional roles of the different habitats in supporting fishery species are still not well understood for most regions. In this study, we review and discuss the available literature to identify key knowledge gaps in the understanding of habitat- and context-specific food webs and trophic interactions supporting fisheries species relying on coastal ecosystems. We use Australia and Australian fisheries species as a case-study, as Australia's extensive coastline encompasses many of the coastal ecosystems and habitats found globally. Given the ever increasing transformation of coastal landscapes by either direct human action or by sea level rise and changing climate, these knowledge gaps need to be urgently addressed for appropriate management and mitigation of various impacts.

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora Invasion on Soil Respiration in the Yangtze River Estuary, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have found that plant invasion can enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, by increasing net primary production (NPP) and/or decreased soil respiration. While most studies have focused on C input, little attention has been paid to plant invasion effects on soil respiration, especially in wetland ecosystems. Our study examined the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil respiration and C dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. The estuary was originally occupied by two native plant species: Phragmites australis in the high tide zone and Scirpus mariqueter in the low tide zone. Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH. Our results indicated that enhanced ANPP by S. alterniflora exceeded invasion-induced C loss through soil respiration. This suggests that S. alterniflora invasion into the Yangtze River estuary could strengthen the net C sink of wetlands in the context of global climate change.

TI  - Toward a mechanistic understanding of "peat collapse" and its potential contribution to coastal wetland loss
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

TI  - Sulphur partitioning in sediments and biodeposits below mussel rafts in the Ria de Arousa (Galicia, NW Spain)
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forty four core samples were analyzed to determine sediment particle size, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen and total sulphur. Sequential extraction of S was also carried out, differentiating AVS (acid volatile sulphide), elemental S, organic S and pyrite S. The results obtained show that the presence of mussel rafts causes intense changes in the physicochemical composition and properties of the sea floor in the Ria de Arousa. The percentage of silt and clay, TOC, TIC and total N were significantly higher in the biodeposit than in the sediment. In contrast, there were no differences between the biodeposit and the sediment in terms of pH (8.0-8.7.) and redox potential. The sediment and biodeposit were always anoxic, with values of redox potentials below -100 mV. In accordance with these conditions, the dominant fraction of S was Pyrite S (FeS2). The AVS fraction and elemental S were present at low concentrations, except in the Uppermost part of each core. Pyrite was relatively stable when the biodeposit and sediment were maintained in suspension for 8 days in oxic sea water; Unlike the AVS fraction, which disappeared within a few hours.

TI  - Temporal Variability in Ecological Stoichiometry and Material Exchange in a Tidally Dominated Estuary (North Inlet, South Carolina) and the Impact on Community Nutrient Status
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the coastal zone, rates of carbon and nutrient exchange are defined by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of individual estuarine systems. Elemental stoichiometry provides a mechanism for simplifying overlapping physical, chemical, and biological drivers into proxies that can be used to compare and monitor estuarine biogeochemistry. To this end, the seasonal and tidal variability of estuarine stoichiometry was examined over an annual cycle in North Inlet (NI), South Carolina. Surface samples for dissolved and particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were collected every 20days (August 2014 to August 2015) over a semi-diurnal tidal cycle. Dissolved nutrient flux estimates of an individual tidal creek were also made. Overall, the results demonstrated the dominance of seasonal versus tidal forcing on water column C:N:P stoichiometry. This seasonal behavior mediated the relative exchange of N and P into and out of the tidal creek and influenced the nutrient status index (NSI) of NI plankton communities. These communities were largely N deficient with the magnitude of this deficiency impacted by assumptions of inorganic versus organic plankton P demand and nutrient supply. Persistent N deficiency appeared to help drive the net import of N, while temporary P surplus likely drives its seasonal export. Combined, these results indicate that material delivery must be considered on seasonal time frames, as net annual fluxes do not reflect the short-term deliveries of C and nutrients into nearshore ecosystems.

TI  - Mobility of rare earth elements, yttrium and scandium from a phosphogypsum stack: Environmental and economic implications
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the mobility and fluxes of REE, Y and Sc under weathering conditions from an anomalously metal-rich phosphogypsum stack in SW Spain. The interactions of the phosphogypsum stack with rainfall and organic matter-rich solutions, simulating the weathering processes observed due to its location on salt-marshes, were simulated by leaching tests (e.g. EN 12457-2 and TCLP). Despite the high concentration of REE, Y and Sc contained in the phosphogypsum stack, their mobility during the leaching tests was very low; <0.66% and 1.8% of the total content of these elements were released during both tests. Chemical and mineralogical evidences suggest that phosphate minerals may act as sources of REE and Y in the phosphogypsum stack while fluoride minerals may act as sinks, controlling their mobility. REE fractionation processes were identified in the phosphogypsum stack; a depletion of LREE in the saturated zone was identified due probably to the dissolution of secondary LREE phosphates previously formed during apatite dissolution in the industrial process. Thus, the vadose zone of the stack would preserve the original REE signature of phosphate rocks. On the other hand, an enrichment of MREE in relation to HREE of edge outflows is observed due to the higher influence of estuarine waters on the leaching process of the phosphogypsum stack. Despite the low mobility of REE, Y and Sc in the phosphogypsum, around 104 kg/yr of REE and 40 kg/yr of Y and Sc are released from the stack to the estuary, which may imply an environmental concern. The information obtained in this study could be used to optimize extraction methods aimed to recover REE, Y and Sc from phosphogypsum, mitigating the pollution to the environment.

TI  - Climate Change Impacts on the Coastal Wetlands of Australia
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian continent spans coastal wetland settings ranging from extensive mangrove forest and sabkha plains occupying in the tropical north, to the southern half of the continent, where high wave energy constrains wetlands within numerous barrier-fronted estuaries, drowned river valleys and coastal embayments. Only on the island of Tasmania are mangroves absent; elsewhere mangroves, Casuarina, Melaleuca and saltmarsh interact in ways illustrative of the effects of ongoing climate, tidal and sea-level change. Observations over several decades have suggested that recent anthropogenic climate change may already be impacting Australian coastal wetlands in important ways. A period of accelerating sea-level rise has been associated with saline intrusion, mangrove encroachment and Melaleuca dieback in the tropical north, punctuated by widespread mangrove mortality in drought periods. The consistent trend of mangrove encroachment and replacement of saltmarsh in the south, is associated with an "accretion deficit" in saltmarsh during contemporary sea-level rise. We review the ecological and cultural implications of these changes, including impacts on habitat provision for migratory birds, fisheries values, carbon sequestration and Indigenous cultural values. Current legislative and policy protections may not be sufficient to meet the increasingly dynamic impacts of climate change in altering wetland boundaries, composition and function.

TI  - Photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in size-fractionated Southern California coastal waters
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photochemical production was measured in bulk and size-fractionated surf zone and source waters (Orange County, California, USA). Post-irradiation (60 min: 300 W ozone-free xenon lamp), maximum H2O2 concentrations were similar to 10000 nM (source) and similar to 1500 nM (surf zone). Average initial hydrogen peroxide production rates (HPPR) were higher in bulk source waters (11 +/- 7.0 nM s(-1)) than the surf zone (2.5 +/- 1 nM s(-1)). A linear relationship was observed between non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon and absorbance coefficient (m(-1) (300 nm)). HPPR increased with increasing absorbance coefficient for bulk and size-fractionated source waters, consistent with photochemical production from CDOM. However, HPPR varied significantly (5x) for surf zone samples with the same absorbance coefficients, even though optical properties suggested CDOM from salt marsh source waters dominates the surf zone. To compare samples with varying CDOM levels, apparent quantum yields (Phi) for H2O2 photochemical production were calculated. Source waters showed no significant difference in Phi between bulk, large (>1000 Da (>1 kDa)) and small (<1 kDa) size fractions, suggesting H2O2 production efficiency is homogeneously distributed across CDOM size. However, surf zone waters had significantly higher Phi than source (bulk 0.086 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.034 +/- 0.013; <1 kDa 0.183 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.027 +/- 0.018; >1 kDa 0.151 +/- 0.090 vs. 0.016 +/- 0.009), suggesting additional production from non-CDOM sources. H2O2 photochemical production was significant for intertidal beach sand and senescent kelp (sunlight; similar to 42 nM h(-1) vs. similar to 5 nM h(-1)), on the order of CDOM production rates previously measured in coastal and oceanic waters. This is the first study of H2O2 photochemical production in size-fractionated coastal waters showing significant production from non-CDOM sources in the surf zone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Substrate and/or substrate-driven changes in the abundance of methanogenic archaea cause seasonal variation of methane production potential in species-specific freshwater wetlands
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are large temporal and spatial variations of methane (CH4) emissions from natural wetlands. To understand temporal changes of CH4 production potential (MPP), soil samples were collected from a permanently inundated Carex lasiocarpa marsh and a summer inundated Calamagrostis angustifolia marsh over the period from June to October of 2011. MPP, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, abundance and community structure of methanogenic archaea were assessed. In the C. lasiocarpa marsh, DOC concentration, MPP and the methanogen population showed similar seasonal variations and maximal values in September. MPP and DOC in the C. angustifolia marsh exhibited seasonal variations and values peaked during August, while the methanogen population decreased with plant growth. Methanogen abundance correlated significantly (P = 0.02) with DOC only for the C. lasiocarpa marsh. During the sampling period, the dominant methanogens were the Methanosaetaceae and Zoige cluster I (ZC-I (TM)) in the C. angustifolia marsh, and Methanomicrobiales and ZC-I (TM) in the C. lasiocarpa marsh. MPP correlated significantly (P = 0.04) with DOC and methanogen population in the C. lasiocarpa marsh but only with DOC in the C. angustifolia marsh. Addition of C. lasiocarpa litter enhanced MPP more effectively than addition of C. angustifolia litter, indicating that temporal variation of substrates is controlled by litter deposition in the C. lasiocarpa marsh while living plant matter is more important in the C. angustifolia marsh. This study indicated that there was no apparent shift in the dominant types of methanogen during the growth season in the species-specific freshwater wetlands. Temporal variation of MPP is controlled by substrates and substrate-driven changes in the abundance of methanogenic archaea in the C. lasiocarpa marsh, while MPP depends only on substrate availability derived from root exudates or soil organic matter in the C. angustifolia marsh.

TI  - Benthic macroinfaunal assemblages associated with Amazonian saltmarshes
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition and abundance of the poorly known benthic macroinfauna associated with northern Brazilian saltmarshes, were described from eight sites (between 0 degrees 42'2.5 '' S, 47 degrees 52'44.1 '' W and 0 degrees 5 '' 17.3 '' S, 46 degrees 36'13.3 '' W) along the Para coast, Brazil. Sampling was carried out in November of 2007. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test for differences in sediment, vegetation and macroinfaunal variables among sites. No vertical zonation of the macroinfauna was detected. Macroinfaunal structure differed greatly among sites with different sediment and vegetation characteristics. Number of individuals and taxa were low in sites with sandy sediments and short, sparse vegetation and high in those with silty sediments with high organic matter and water contents, and tall, dense vegetation. Increasing number of individuals and taxa were associated with a geographical gradient in pore water salinity, which increases from west to east, coinciding with patterns of rainfall described for the Para coast.

T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mean relative growth rate and net photosynthesis of Aster tripoliun, Spartina anglica, Puccinellia maritima and Elymus pycnanthus, grown in a range of NaCl concentrations in nutrient solution, were studied in a controlled environment. In all four species mean relative growth rate and net photosynthesis were reduced by NaCl. Mean relative growth rate of the most salt tolerant species, S. anglica, was significantly reduced at 450 mM NaCl. Growth of P. maritima and A. tripolium was significantly inhibited at 300 mM NaCl, and growth of E. pycnanthus, the most salt sensitive species was reduced at 150 mM NaCl. Net photosynthesis was significantly inhibited by increasing concentrations of NaCl in the nutrient solution for all four salt marsh species studied. The reduction of net photosynthesis by salinity in Spartina anglica did not differ from the inhibition found for Elymus pycnanthus. Inhibition of net photosynthesis by salinity does not seem to be the primary cause of the growth reduction measured in the four species.The various physiological causes of growth reduction by salinity are discussed.

TI  - The cytokinin trans-zeatine riboside increased resistance to heavy metals in the halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya pentacarpos in the absence but not in the presence of NaCl
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metals such as cadmium and zinc constitute major pollutants in coastal areas and frequently accumulate in salt marshes. The wetland halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya pentacarpos is a promising species for phytostabilization of contaminated areas. In order to assess the role of the antisenescing phytohormone cytokinin in heavy metal resistance in this species, seedlings were exposed for two weeks to Cd (10 mu M), Zn (100 mu M) or Cd + Zn (10 mu M + 100 mu M) in the presence or absence of 50 mM NaCl and half of the plants were sprayed every two days with the cytokinin trans-zeatine riboside (10 mu M). Zinc reduced the endogenous cytokinin concentration. Exogenous cytokinin increased plant growth, stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis and total ascorbate and reduced oxidative stress estimated by malondialdehyde in Zn-treated plants maintained in the absence of NaCl. Heavy metal induced an increase in the senescing hormone ethylene which was reduced by cytokinin treatment. Plants exposed to the mixed treatment (Cd + Zn) exhibited a specific hormonal status in relation to accumulation of abscisic acid and depletion of salicylic acid. Non-protein thiols (glutathione and phytochelatins) accumulated in response to Cd and Cd + Zn. It is concluded that toxic doses of Cd and Zn have different impacts on the plant behavior and that the simultaneous presence of the two elements induces a specific physiological constraint at the plant level. Salinity helps the plant to cope with heavy metal toxicities and the plant hormone cytokinin assumes key function in Zn resistance but its efficiency is lower in the presence of NaCl.

TI  - PYRITE FORMATION IN 2 FRESH-WATER SYSTEMS IN THE NETHERLANDS
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cycling of Fe and S was investigated in sediments of Gerritsfles and Kliplo, two acidic shallow moorland pools in the Netherlands, in order to reveal the importance of pyrite as a pool of inorganic S. The porewater chemistry in both pool sediments is extremely dynamic as, e.g., Fe2+ concentrations may increase twentyfold within a time span of a month. Periodic oxidized conditions occur in the top several centimetres of the sediment. The redox status appeared to be a main factor in determining whether pyrite or a monosulfide, defined by the content of acid volatile sulfur (AVS), is formed. In Gerritsfles and Kliplo, pyrite was the most important iron sulfide phase; sedimentary FeS2-S/AVS-S molar ratios were 32 and 55, respectively. In other lakes, where stratification caused anaerobic conditions in the hypolimnion, FeS2/AVS ratios were < 1. Morphological investigation by light and scanning electron microscopy indicated that pyrite was present as single crystals and as framboids. The framboids, mainly associated with organic matter, were thought to form in microsites where they may form slowly. The presence of a single crystal morphology point to a rapid formation of pyrite.

TI  - Linking habitat structure to life history strategy: Insights from a Mediterranean killifish
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern theories of life history evolution deal with finding links between environmental factors, demographic structure of animal populations and the optimal life history strategy. Small-sized teleost fish, occurring in fragmented populations under contrasting environments, have been widely used as study models to investigate these issues. In the present study, the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus was used to investigate the relationships between some habitat features and life history strategy. We selected four sites in the Venice lagoon inhabited by this species, exhibiting different combinations of two factors: overall adult mortality, related to intertidal water coverage and a consequent higher level of predator exposure, and the level of sediment organic matter, as indicator of habitat trophic richness. Results showed that these were the two most important factors influencing demography and life history traits in the four sites. Fish from salt marshes with high predator pressure were smaller and produced a higher number of eggs, whereas bigger fish and a lower reproductive investment were found in the two closed, not tidally influenced habitats. Habitat richness was positively related with population density, but negatively related with growth rate. In particular the synergy between high resources and low predation level was found to be important in shaping peculiar life history traits. Results were discussed in the light of the interactions between selective demographic forces acting differentially on age/size classes, such as predation, and habitat trophic richness that may represent an important energetic constraint on life history traits. The importance to link habitat productivity and morphology to demographic factors for a better understanding of the evolution of life history strategy under contrasting environments was finally suggested.

T2  - CRUSTACEANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Population dynamics and production of the amphipod, Orchestia gammarellus were studied for two years in a Ria Formosa saltmarsh (southern Portugal). The animals were sampled every 6th week using pitfall traps and core samples. The highest densities were recorded in the organic matter deposits during spring 1999 (core samples) and most intense activity (pitfall traps) during autumn 1998. Females lived for 8-11 months and reached up to 14 mm body length while males lived for 812 months and reached 17 mm body length. Reproduction was continuous and started when females were 6-7 months old. Females produced, on an average, 17 eggs each and fecundity increased with size. Sex ratio was 58% on an annual average. Daily mortality was generally high (0.9%) with higher values in spring/summer (1.8%) and lower in autumn/winter (0.5%). Significant differences in the Von Bertalanffy growth curves were found with males growing faster than females. Annual production has been calculated by the increment summation method as 1.4 g AFDW/m(2) with a corresponding P/B ratio of 3.9. Production rate was highest in spring and summer 1999. It is pointed out that O. gammarellus has adopted an r-strategy to exploit this saltmarsh.

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of nutrient enrichment on salt marsh plant production and microbial community structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient enrichment impacts ecosystems globally. Population history, especially past resource environments, of numerically dominant plant species may affect their responses to subsequent changes in nutrient availability. Eutrophication can also alter plant-microbe interactions via direct effects on associated microbial communities or indirect effects on dominant species' biomass production/allocation as a result of modified plant-soil interactions. We combined a greenhouse common garden and a field reciprocal transplant of a salt marsh foundation species (Spartina alterniflora) within a long-term, whole-ecosystem, nutrient-enrichment study to determine whether enrichment affects plant production and microbial community structure differently depending on plant population history. For the greenhouse portion, we collected 20 S. alterniflora genotypes-10 from an enriched creek that had received elevated nutrient inputs for 10 years and 10 from an unenriched reference creek-and reared them in a common garden for 1 year. For the field portion, we conducted a 2-year, fully crossed reciprocal transplant experiment with two gardens each at the enriched and unenriched sites; we examined the effects of source site (i.e. population history), garden site and plant genotype. After 2 years, plants in enriched gardens had higher above-ground biomass and altered below-ground allocation compared to plants in unenriched gardens. However, performance also depended on plant population history: plants from the enriched site had decreased above-ground and rhizome production compared to plants from the unenriched site, most notably in unenriched gardens. In addition, almost all above- and below-ground traits varied depending on plant genotypic identity. Effects of nutrient enrichment on the associated microbial community were also pronounced. Following 1 year in common garden, microbial community structure varied by plant population history and S. alterniflora genotypic identity. However, at the end of the reciprocal transplant, microbial communities differed primarily between enriched and unenriched gardens. Synthesis. Nutrient enrichment can impact plant foundation species and associated soil microbes in the short term. Most importantly, nutrient enrichment can also have long-lasting effects on plant populations and associated microbial communities that potentially compromise their ability to respond to changing resource conditions in the future.

TI  - Chernobyl Cs-137 used to determine sediment accretion rates at selected northern European coastal wetlands
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment cores were collected from five coastal wetlands along the North Sea (England and Netherlands) and Baltic Sea (Poland). Cs-137 dating was used to assess sediment accretion rates, including rates based on the Cs-137 peak from the 1986 accident at Chernobyl. Peaks from the Chernobyl fallout were found in cores from the Oder and Vistula Rivers in Poland, from the Eastern Scheldt in the Netherlands, and in one of the two cores from Stiffkey Marsh, U.K. No evidence of Chernobyl fallout was found in cores from Dengie Marsh, U.K. The Chernobyl Cs-137 peak serves as an excellent marker for short-term accretion rates because of its high activity. Vertical accretion rates (cm yr(-1)) based on 1963 and 1986 peaks were similar at most sites; differences may be due to large inputs of sediment from storms or recent accumulation of organic matter. Large differences in sediment characteristics and accretion rates were found between samples from Poland and western Europe. Vertical accretion rates over the period 1963-1986 ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 cm yr(-1) and from 0.30 to 1.90 cm yr(-1) over the 1986-1991 period. Vertical accretion rates for the period 1963-1991 were greater than the rates of relative sea-level rise for all cores, so it does not seem that any of these sites are in imminent danger of excessive flooding. The Chernobyl Cs-137 peak will be especially useful for studies of short-term (i.e. very recent) sedimentation in the near future and for comparisons of sediment processes over different time scales.

TI  - Historical sedimentary trends of mercury and other trace elements from two saltmarshes of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd International Symposium on Environmental Biogeochemistry (ISEB)
CL  - Piran, SLOVENIA
AB  - Purpose Previous research conducted in the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea) has shown that this environment has been affected by trace metal contamination, especially by mercury (Hg), from both industrial (the chlor-alkali plant) and mining activities (Idrija mine, Slovenia). Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg. Conservation and monitoring of saltmarshes should be taken into consideration also from this environmental point of view.

M3  - Data set
AB  - This dataset provides mapped tidal wetland gross primary production (GPP) estimates (g C/m2/day) derived from multiple wetland types at 250-m resolution across the conterminous United States at 16-day intervals from March 5, 2000, through November 17, 2019. GPP was derived with the spatially explicit Blue Carbon (BC) model, which combined tidal wetland cover and field-based eddy covariance (EC) tower GPP data into a single Bayesian framework and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Model development entailed determining the locations of and grouping of tidal wetlands into four classes: woody mangroves, woody freshwater swamps, herbaceous salt marshes, and herbaceous freshwater wetlands. Tidal wetlands are a critical component of global climate regulation. Tidal wetland-based carbon, or "blue carbon," is a valued resource that is increasingly important for restoration and conservation purposes.

TI  - Infilling of the Canche Estuary (eastern English Channel, France): Insight from benthic foraminifera and historical pictures
T2  - MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A multiproxy approach based on benthic foraminifera, sediment grain-size, total organic carbon content, major and trace element concentrations, and radionuclide activities was used to investigate the recent landscape evolution of the Canche Estuary (eastern English Channel, France). In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries. When dating is not provided by classic radiometric methods, historical pictures (< 100 years) may constitute a valuable alternative method to reconstruct recent environments.

TI  - Changes in Sediment Organic Carbon Accumulation under Conditions of Historical Sea-Level Rise, Southeast Saline Everglades, Florida, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves can store more sediment organic carbon (SOC) than freshwater and salt marshes. Understanding how mangroves have responded to historical sea-level rise (SLR) is fundamental to assessing their resilience and capacity to store carbon as SLR accelerates. We quantified landscape-level temporal and spatial trends in historical coastal wetland sediment accumulation and associated SOC content (i.e., storage) along coastal-to-inland gradients in Southeast Florida. The observed trends were transgressive and attributed to the historical rise in sea level. Our results indicate an overall significant increase in the SOC content of the historic wetland sediment succession caused by the vertical accumulation and landward migration of carbon-rich mangrove-dominated plant communities (mean = 0.08 g cm(-3)) into and over carbon-poor wet prairie plant communities (mean = 0.02 g cm(-3)). The observed historical increase in SOC is predicted to diminish over time as the difference between rates of SLR and vertical sediment accumulation increases and because the landward migration of mangrove-dominated plant communities is now obstructed by a shore-parallel flood-control levee. These results are likely to unfold in other low-latitude coastal wetlands where they are sandwiched between rising seas and an urbanized landscape.

TI  - Short-term water quality variability in two tropical estuaries, central Sumatra
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined high frequency fluctuations in water quality parameters in two tropical coastal plain estuaries in response to changing tidal flow conditions. The variability in total suspended sediments (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, and indicators of water quality, including pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, over one spring tidal cycle during the early wet monsoon season was measured in two estuaries in eastern Sumatra. The relatively high rainfall experienced throughout the year, in combination with the recent extensive vegetation clearing and modification of the landscape, resulted in significant concentrations of TSS, VSS, and TOC being discharged to coastal waters. Maximum values are reached on the ebb tide (TSS > 1,013 mg l(-1); VSS > 800 mg l(-1); TOC > 60 mg l(-1)). The influence of freshwater discharge and tidal flow on water properties of the lower estuaries is also marked by the variability in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the tidal cycle, with minimum values for each of these parameters following maximum current velocities and after the completion of the strong ebb tide. Estimation of seaward sediment fluxes, which are of significant interest in a region where rapid environmental change is occurring, would require further examination of sedimentary processes, such as resuspension and advection of sediment, as well as a consideration of neap-spring tidal variations and the effect of seasonality on estuarine circulation.

AB  - Fish habitat use is affected by biotic and environmental factors. These factors do not act in isolation; they commonly operate together, and can be modified by the presence of habitat structure, like vegetation. We studied at the Bahia Blanca estuary (38 degrees 52' S, 62 0 degrees 6' W), the seasonal patterns of fish habitat use in a Spartina alterniflora saltmarsh and a contiguous tidal fiat, and related them with biotic and environmental factors. The results showed that all fish species contributed to differences in the structure of fish assemblages between areas. The silverside Odontesthes argentinensis and the menhaden Brevoortia aurea were more abundant and smaller in size in the saltmarsh. In this area, the structure of fish assemblage was positively correlated with the structure of benthic community. The latter, was probably related to the high abundance of the polychaete Laeonereis acuta, the main benthic prey for fishes. Environmental factors that correlated with the structure of fish assemblages were particulate organic matter and sediment penetrability, both in the saltmarsh and in the tidal flat. This evidenced that in terms of physical and chemical factors studied, both areas present similar characteristics for fishes. This work highlights that saltmarshes in southern hemisphere provide both protection and food resources for fishes, and give support to the notion of saltmarshes as important fish habitat worldwide.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in two coastal wetlands in the northeastern Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea
T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured in wetlands in Liminganlahti (Baltic Sea) in the vicinity of the estuaries of the Lumijoki and Temmesjoki. Wetlands were significant sources of CH4, with a mean flux of 206 mg m(-2) d(-1). Methane fluxes correlated positively with temperature and were slightly higher from the wetland of the Lumijoki, where water SO42- concentrations were lower. On average, the wetland close to the Temmesjoki was a small source of N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)), whereas the wetland close to the Lumijoki was a small sink for N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)). The higher availability of nitrogen in the wetland near the Temmesjoki obviously induced the higher N2O fluxes. Estuarine wetlands seem to be important Sources of atmospheric CH4 but do not represent an important source of N2O although increased N loading.

TI  - Variable Impacts of Climate Change on Blue Carbon
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.

TI  - Exploring the role of organic matter accumulation on delta evolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the role of plant matter accumulation in the sediment column in determining the response of fluvial-deltas to base-level rise and simple subsidence profiles. Making the assumption that delta building processes operate to preserve the geometry of the delta plain, we model organic sedimentation in terms of the plant matter accumulation and accommodation (space made for sediment deposition) rates. A spatial integration of the organic sedimentation, added to the known river sediment input, leads to a model of delta evolution that estimates the fraction of organic sediments preserved in the delta. The model predicts that the maximum organic fraction occurs when the organic matter accumulation rate matches the accommodation rate, a result consistent with field observations. The model also recovers the upper limit for coal accumulation previously reported in the coal literature. Further, when the model is extended to account for differences in plant matter accumulation between fresh and saline environments (i.e., methanogenesis versus sulfate reduction) we show that an abrupt shift in the location of the fresh-salt boundary can amplify the speed of shoreline retreat.

TI  - Contemporary Deposition and Long-Term Accumulation of Sediment and Nutrients by Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands Impacted by Sea Level Rise
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary deposition (artificial marker horizon, 3.5 years) and long-term accumulation rates (Pb-210 profiles, similar to 150 years) of sediment and associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measured in wetlands along the tidal Savannah and Waccamaw rivers in the southeastern USA. Four sites along each river spanned an upstream-to-downstream salinification gradient, from upriver tidal freshwater forested wetland (TFFW), through moderately and highly salt-impacted forested wetlands, to oligohaline marsh downriver. Contemporary deposition rates (sediment, C, N, and P) were greatest in oligohaline marsh and lowest in TFFW along both rivers. Greater rates of deposition in oligohaline and salt-stressed forested wetlands were associated with a shift to greater clay and metal content that is likely associated with a change from low availability of watershed-derived sediment to TFFW and to greater availability of a coastal sediment source to oligohaline wetlands. Long-term accumulation rates along the Waccamaw River had the opposite spatial pattern compared to contemporary deposition, with greater rates in TFFW that declined to oligohaline marsh. Long-term sediment and elemental mass accumulation rates also were 3-9x lower than contemporary deposition rates. In comparison to other studies, sediment and associated nutrient accumulation in TFFW are lower than downriver/estuarine freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marshes, suggesting a reduced capacity for surface sedimentation (short-term) as well as shallow soil processes (long-term sedimentation) to offset sea level rise in TFFW. Nonetheless, their potentially large spatial extent suggests that TFFW have a large impact on the transport and fate of sediment and nutrients in tidal rivers and estuaries.

TI  - Tidal Freshwater Marshes Harbor Phylogenetically Unique Clades of Sulfate Reducers That Are Resistant to Climate-Change-Induced Salinity Intrusion
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates of sea level rise associated with climate change are predicted to increase in the future, potentially altering ecosystems at all ecological levels. Sea level rise can increase the extent of brackish water intrusion into freshwater ecosystems, which in turn can affect the structure and function of resident microbial communities. In this study, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment using intact tidal freshwater marsh sediment cores to examine the effect of a 5-part per thousand (ppt) salinity increase on the diversity and community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. We used a clone library approach to examine the dsrA gene, which encodes an important catalytic enzyme in sulfate reduction. Our results indicate that tidal freshwater marshes contain extremely diverse communities of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Members of these communities were, on average, only 71 % similar to known cultured sulfate reducers and 81 % similar to previously sequenced environmental clones. Salinity and associated increases in sulfate availability did not significantly affect the diversity or community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. However, carbon quality and quantity, which correlated with depth, were found to be the strongest drivers of sulfate-reducing community structure. Our study demonstrates that the sulfate-reducing community in tidal freshwater marsh sediments appears resistant to increased salinity in the face of sea level rise. Additionally, the microorganisms that comprise this sulfate-reducing community appear to be unique to tidal freshwater marsh sediments and may represent novel lineages of previously undescribed sulfate reducers.

TI  - SEDIMENT DEPOSITION PATTERNS IN RESTORED FRESH-WATER WETLANDS USING SEDIMENT TRAPS
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sedimentation rates in constructed wetlands in northeastern Illinois, USA, ranged from 5.9 to 12.8 kg m(-2) y(-1) in 1989-1990, higher than expected based on concentrations of suspended sediment in influent waters of the wetlands. This predicted an accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 cm/y. Rates were significantly lower in 1991 growing season, ranging from 1.2 to 4.2 kg m(-2) y(-1). Factors contributing to the high sedimentation included internal autochthonous production of organic matter and resuspension. Low- and high-flow hydrologic conditions had little effect on sedimentation from 1989-90 but sedimentation was higher in the high-flow wetlands in the 1991 growing season. Deposition was a function of hydrologic loading near the water inflows; no differences were evident further downstream in the basins. Deposition rates and organic and phosphorus concentrations of the sediments increased through the growing season in conjunction with higher sediment concentrations in the inflow water. The patchy nature of vegetation density within the experimental wetlands created channelized flow, resulting in spatial variability in sediment deposition.

TI  - Ecophysiological responses of the salt marsh grass Spartina maritima to salinity
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of salinity on growth and productivity of Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald were investigated in glasshouse and field experiments in 2008. In the glasshouse study, plants were subjected to 2%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 80% sea water, with tidal simulation, for 10 months. Increase in salinity from 2% to 20% sea water increased biomass accumulation, CO2 exchange, quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII), electron transport rate (ETR) through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII, while further increases in salinity to 80% resulted in significant decreases in these parameters. Concentrations of proline increased significantly with increase in salinity up to 80% sea water. In the field study, soil physicochemical conditions between streamside and inland sites were compared, and the constraints imposed by any differences on plant ecophysiological responses determined. At the inland site, soil water potential (Psi), electrical conductivity of the soil, total cations, and the concentrations of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and P, were significantly higher than those of the streamside site, while CO2 exchange, quantum yield of PSII, ETR through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII were significantly lower. The results suggest that S. maritima grows optimally at a salinity of about 20% sea water, and that higher salinity decreases growth and photosynthetic performance.

TI  - S-34/S-32 fractionation by sulfate-reducing microbial communities in estuarine sediments
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction in brackish estuarine sediments was studied using an experimental flow-through reactor approach designed to preserve the in situ physical, geochemical and microbial structure of the sediment. Concurrent measurements of potential sulfate reduction rates and S-34/S-32 fractionations were carried out using intact sediment slices (2 cm thick, 4.2 cm diameter) from unvegetated, intertidal sites adjoining a salt marsh along the Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands. A total of 30 reactor experiments were performed with sediments collected in February, May and October 2006. The effects of incubation temperature (10, 20, 30 and 50 degrees C) and sediment depth (0-2, 4-6 and 8-10 cm) were investigated. Sulfate was supplied in non-limiting concentrations via the reactor inflow solutions; no external electron donor was supplied. Isotope fractionations (epsilon values) were calculated from the measured differences in sulfate delta S-34 between in-and outflow solutions of the reactors, under quasi-steady state conditions. Potential sulfate reduction rates (SRR) varied over one order of magnitude (5-49 nmol cm(-3) h(-1)) and were highest in the 30 degrees C incubations. They decreased systematically with depth, and were highest in the sediments collected closest to the vegetated marsh. Isotope fractionations ranged from 9 parts per thousand to 34 parts per thousand and correlated inversely with SRR, as predicted by the standard fractionation model for enzymatic sulfate reduction of Rees (1973). The epsilon versus SRR relationship, however, varied between sampling times, with higher e values measured in February, at comparable SRRs, than in May and October. The observed epsilon versus SRR relationships also deviated from the previously reported inverse trend for sediments collected in a marine lagoon in Denmark (Canfield, 2001b). Thus, isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction is not uniquely determined by SRR, but is site-and time-dependent. Factors that may affect the epsilon versus SRR relationship include the structure and size of the sulfate-reducing community, and the nature and accessibility of organic substrates. Whole-sediment data such as those presented here provide a link between isotopic fractionations measured with pure cultures of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes and sulfur isotopic signatures recorded in sedimentary deposits.

TI  - Growth and survival of Halimione portulacoides stem cuttings in heavy metal contaminated soils
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The halophytic shrub Halimione portulacoides demonstrates a high tolerance to heavy metal contamination and a capacity for accumulating metals within its tissues. On the Iberian Peninsula, this species has colonized habitats with high levels of metal pollution. The aim of this study is to analyze the response of H. portulacoides stem cuttings to this pollution. Growth, photosynthesis and metal uptake were examined in H. portulacoides through an experiment in which stem cuttings were replanted in metal-contaminated soil. This condition decreased growth and lowered both photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance. Reduced photosynthetic performance was largely due to the reduced concentration of photosynthetic pigments. Despite these responses, there was some important evidence suggesting the phytoremediatory potential of Halimione stem cuttings. The results of our study indicate that this salt-marsh shrub may represent a biotool of value in the restoration of polluted areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of salinity on temperature-dependent photosynthetic parameters of a native C-3 and a non-native C-4 marsh grass in the Yangtze Estuary, China
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of Spartina alterniflora along the coasts of China has allowed this C-4 grass to outcompete often much of the native, salt marsh vegetation, such as Phragmites australis (C-3 grass), in the Yangtze Estuary. In this study, native grass, P. australis, and non-native grass, S. alterniflora, were grown in fresh and saline water (moderate salinity of 15aEuro degrees and high salinity of 30aEuro degrees) to compare the effects of salinity on photosynthetic and biochemical parameters in combination with measurement temperatures. The C-4 grass, S. alterniflora, showed a greater CO2 assimilation rate than P. australis, across the tested temperatures. The net photosynthetic rate declined significantly with increasing salinity as a result of inhibited stomatal conductance together with a greater decrease in the maximum rate of electron transport (J (max)). In P. australis, salt treatments shifted the optimum temperatures for the maximum rate of carboxylation by Rubisco (V (cmax)) and J (max) to lower temperatures. S. alterniflora showed a greater salt tolerance to moderate stress than that of the native grass, with lower sensitivity of V (cmax), J (max), and the maximum rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation. Both moderate and high stress decreased significantly stomatal conductance of S. alterniflora; high salinity reduced significantly photosynthetic efficiency and J (max). Our findings indicated that the combination of stomatal conductance, enzyme activity, and electron transport affected the photosynthetic performance of the plants in response to salt treatments. The success of S. alterniflora could be probably attributed to its C-4 photosynthetic pathway and the tolerance to moderate salinity. In this study, a modified parameterization of the photosynthetic model was suggested to support a more reasonable simulation of photosynthesis under salt stress.

TI  - C/S ratios in estuarine sediments of the Odiel River-mouth, SW Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - iron-sulfide formation in estuarine environments is controlled by sulfur availability, which is distinct in each subenvironment. Along the mesotidal, mixed-energy Huelva coast, s.w. Spain, appreciable quantites of iron sulfide appear in all the estuarine sediments. Formation of iron sulfides in the Odiel River estuary is produced under different crystallization habits in the various subenvironments. There are: (1) octahedral bipyramidal crystals, (2) concentrated crystals in the tests of foraminifers, and (3) framboidal aggregates. Sediments display higher organic carbon/sulfur ratios in the subtidal channel subenvironment than in the intertidal channel-margin sectors. This is because the channel is always submerged under water, thereby producing the sulfur available for bacterial activity. In contrast, the channel-margin sectors are only periodically submerged. Sediments of the salt marsh sectors show C/S ratio values near to those observed in fresh-water environments, since the organic carbon content is highest with only minor sulfur content because the flood water enters it only periodically. The sterile marsh sectors show a higher C/S ratio than those from the marine environments because they are reached only by astronomic tides, occurring every 60 or 183 days. The water introduced there remains for a sufficient time to allow for the sulfur to be completely comsumed. All these differences found in each estuarine subenvironment are clearly recorded in the direct correlations with distinct slopes corresponding to different C/S ratios.

TI  - Discerning natural and anthropogenic organic matter inputs to salt marsh sediments of Ria Formosa lagoon (South Portugal)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sedimentary organic matter (OM) origin and molecular composition provide useful information to understand carbon cycling in coastal wetlands. Core sediments from threors' Contributionse transects along Ria Formosa lagoon intertidal zone were analysed using analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) to determine composition, distribution and origin of sedimentary OM. The distribution of alkyl compounds (alkanes, alkanoic acids and alkan-2-ones), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), lignin-derived methoxyphenols, linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), steranes and hopanes indicated OM inputs to the intertidal environment from natural-autochthonous and allochthonous-as well as anthropogenic. Several n-alkane geochemical indices used to assess the distribution of main OM sources (terrestrial and marine) in the sediments indicate that algal and aquatic macrophyte derived OM inputs dominated over terrigenous plant sources. The lignin-derived methoxyphenol assemblage, dominated by vinylguaiacol and vinylsyringol derivatives in all sediments, points to large OM contribution from higher plants. The spatial distributions of PAHs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) showed that most pollution sources were mixed sources including both pyrogenic and petrogenic. Low carbon preference indexes (CPI > 1) for n-alkanes, the presence of UCM (unresolved complex mixture) and the distribution of hopanes (C-29-C-36) and steranes (C-27-C-29) suggested localized petroleum-derived hydrocarbon inputs to the core sediments. Series of LABs were found in most sediment samples also pointing to domestic sewage anthropogenic contributions to the sediment OM.

TI  - Distribution of biologic, anthropogenic, and volcanic constituents as a proxy for sediment transport in the San Francisco Bay Coastal System
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although conventional sediment parameters (mean grain size, sorting, and skewness) and provenance have typically been used to infer sediment transport pathways, most freshwater, brackish, and marine environments are also characterized by abundant sediment constituents of biological, and possibly anthropogenic and volcanic, origin that can provide additional insight into local sedimentary processes. The biota will be spatially distributed according to its response to environmental parameters such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon content, grain size, and intensity of currents and tidal flow, whereas the presence of anthropogenic and volcanic constituents will reflect proximity to source areas and whether they are fluvially- or aerially-transported. Because each of these constituents have a unique environmental signature, they are a more precise proxy for that source area than the conventional sedimentary process indicators.This San Francisco Bay Coastal System study demonstrates that by applying a multi-proxy approach, the primary sites of sediment transport can be identified. Many of these sites are far from where the constituents originated, showing that sediment transport is widespread in the region. Although not often used, identifying and interpreting the distribution of naturally-occurring and allochthonous biologic, anthropogenic, and volcanic sediment constituents is a powerful tool to aid in the investigation of sediment transport pathways in other coastal systems.

TI  - Effect of Spartina alterniflora Loisel, 1807 on growth of the stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius (Lightfoot, 1786) in a SW Atlantic estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic organisms that produce epibenthic structures such as saltmarsh plants play key roles in habitat functioning through their ecosystem engineering effects. Intertidal Spartina species are well known for modifying tidal hydrodynamic and sediment processes, affecting cohabiting infaunal organisms. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius is an infaunal filter-feeding species that inhabits a broad range of mudflats (MF) and Spartina saltmarshes (SM) along the American Atlantic coast. Through descriptive and experimental approaches conducted at the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, 38 degrees 47'S, 62 degrees 20'W), we evaluated ecosystem engineer effects of Spartina alterniflora (due to changes in sediment and water characteristics) on somatic and shell growth of T. plebeius. Comparison of bulk sediment parameters indicated that the sediment is more easily eroded in the SM than in the MF, but softer in the latest. In addition, food supply for clams (i.e., total particulate organic matter) was higher in the MF although food quality (i.e., percentage of organic matter in the water column) was in general higher in SM. Shell growth was higher but clam condition index (CI) was lower in the MF, and the opposite pattern was found in the SM. These results represent an uncoupling between shell and somatic growth with a positive effect of S. alterniflora on the Cl of clams. Nevertheless, results of field experiments manipulating stems and roots of plants separately suggested that the effect of Spartina on clam's Cl was not due to the structural changes generated by plant presence itself, although a better food quality in the SM may be related to the larger clam.

TI  - Tidal cycling of mercury and methylmercury between sediments and water column in the Venice Lagoon (Italy)
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sediment of Venice Lagoon regularly undergoes complex redistribution due to tidal forcing, which affects the cycling of contaminants such as mercury (Hg) between the sediment and the water column. We examined the distribution of total Hg (THg) and monomethylmercury (MMHg) in the water column, sediment and pore-water at two sites: VE1 (located in a depositional area adjacent to salt marshes) and VE2 corresponding to a moderately erosive, open area. We obtained instantaneous (using cores and micro-needle samplers) and time-integrated (using peepers) concentrations of the two mercury species in both dissolved and particulate forms. THg and MMHg concentrations were higher in the sediments at site VE1 (621.9 +/- 213.7 ng g(-1) and 1.25 +/- 0.63 ng g(-1) for THg and MMHg, respectively) than in those of the site VE2 (386.9 +/- 92.7 ng g(-1) and 0.53 +/- 0.30 ng g(-1)). Hg concentrations in sediments were positively correlated with silts and organic matter content. Over two tidal cycles, the concentrations of THg and MMHg varied with the evolution of the tides. During the tidal flooding, both THg and MMHg peaked at the sediment-water interface and a moderate increase of dissolved MMHg was also observed in the water column. These fluctuations were observed during both tides and are suggestively related to advection of mercury species from surficial sediment pore-water to the water column and to desorption from suspended particles. The short-term increase in MMHg concentrations can result from in situ production, release from organic matter degradation, or from oxidative dissolution of redox-sensitive sulfide minerals and iron oxide reduction by micro-organisms: the two latter mechanisms being favored by redox oscillations in the surface sediment layers due to the tidal forcing. The decrease of both dissolved THg and MMHg concentrations at the sediment-water interface after high tide was attributed to a rapid adsorption onto particles. THg concentrations on suspended particles showed little variations during the tidal cycle with a minor peak at tide maximum, while MMHg concentrations on suspended particles slightly increased during ebb tide. MMHg concentrations on suspended particles were double than those in surface sediments, suggesting that tidal flushing may enhance dispersal of particle bound MMHg throughout the lagoon.

TI  - Biogeochemical and plant trait mechanisms drive enhanced methane emissions in response to whole-ecosystem warming
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming perturbs ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, causing both positive and negative feedbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, we began a tidal marsh field experiment in two vegetation communities to investigate the mechanisms by which whole-ecosystem warming alters C gain, via plant-driven sequestration in soils, and C loss, primarily via methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we report the results from the first 4 years. As expected, warming of 5.1 degrees C more than doubled CH4 emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4 consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits. Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate coastal wetland responses to climate change.

TI  - Comparison of belowground biomass in C-3- and C-4-dominated mixed communities in a Chesapeake Bay brackish marsh
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Below ground biomass is a critical factor regulating ecosystem functions of coastal marshes, including soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and the ability of these systems to keep pace with sea-level rise. Nevertheless, below ground biomass responses to environmental and vegetation changes have been given little emphasis marsh studies. Here we present a method using stable carbon isotopes and color to identify root and rhizomes of Schoenoplectus americanus (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz and R. Keller (C-3) and Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. (C-4) occurring in C-3- and C-4-dominated communities in a Chesapeake Bay brackish marsh. The functional significance of the biomass classes we identified is underscored by differences in their chemistry, depth profiles, and variation in biomass and profiles relative to abiotic and biotic factors. C-3 rhizomes had the lowest concentrations of cellulose (29.19%) and lignin (14.43%) and the lowest C:N (46.97) and lignin:N (0.16) ratios. We distinguished two types of C-3 roots, and of these, the dark red C-3 roots had anomalously high C:N (195.35) and lignin:N (1.14) ratios, compared with other root and rhizome classes examined here and with previously published values. The C-4-dominated community had significantly greater below ground biomass (4119.1 g m(-2)) than the C-3-dominated community (3256.9 g m(-2)), due to greater total root biomass and a 3.6-fold higher C-3-root:rhizome ratio in the C-4-dominated community. C-3 rhizomes were distributed significantly shallower in the C-4-dominated community, while C-3 roots were significantly deeper. Variability in C3 rhizome depth distributions was explained primarily by C-4 biomass, and C-3 roots were explained primarily by water table height. Our results suggest that below ground biomass in this system is sensitive to slight variations in water table height (across an 8 cm range), and that the reduced overlap between C-3 and C-4 root profiles in the C-4-dominated community may account for the greater total root biomass observed in that community. Given that future elevated atmospheric CO2 and accelerated sea-level rise are likely to increase C-3 abundance in Atlantic and Gulf coast marshes, investigations that quantify how patterns of C-3 and C-4 below ground biomass respond to environmental and biological factors stand to improve our understanding of ecosystem-wide impacts of global changes on coastal wetlands.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of sediment-associated fluoranthene in benthic copepods: uptake, elimination and biotransformation
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) entering aquatic systems reside in sediments and in the storage lipids of the benthic biota. Massive amounts of PAHs reach estuarine systems and threaten their ecosystems. Copepods abound in the estuarine benthos, where they are an important component of food webs. The accumulation of sediment-associated [C-14]fluoranthene was examined in adult females of two species of sediment-dwelling copepods, Schizopera knabeni and Coullana sp., collected from a Louisiana salt marsh. Accumulation was measured throughout a short- (24 h) and a long-term (10-day) exposure to concentrations in the sediment ranging from 0 to 1652 nmol (g dry wt.)(-1). Fluoranthene apparent steady slate body residue was reached very rapidly(< 12 h) at all concentrations for both species. Lipid and organic-carbon-normalized bioaccumulation factors (BSAFs) calculated at day 1 were 0.57-0.80 for S, knabeni and 0.35-0.71 for Coullana sp. Fluoranthene body burden in female Coullana sp. changed dramatically during their reproductive cycle. A significant fraction of the fluoranthene residue was stored in the lipid-rich maturing eggs which were extruded into paired egg sacs. For S, knabeni, fluoranthene depuration occurred at similar rates in sediment and water (half life approximately 4.8 h), while it was faster in sediment than in water for Coullana sp. (half lives = 4.2 and 7.4 h). Fluoranthene was biotransformed to polar compounds in both species. Metabolites accounted for approximately 12% of the C-14 activity in the tissues following a 96-h sediment exposure in both species, Given that fluoranthene was taken up from spiked sediment very efficiently and reached steady-state levels in the tissues very rapidly, PAH-contaminated sediments may pose a risk for benthic copepods and their predators.

TI  - Variability of the partial pressure of CO2 on a daily-to-seasonal time scale in a shallow coastal system affected by intensive aquaculture activities (Bay of Cadiz, SW Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study describes the temporal variability of the water fCO(2) as well as the different driving forces controlling this variability, on time scales from daily to seasonal, in the Rio San Pedro, a tidal creek located in a salt marsh area in the Bay of Cadiz (SW Iberian Peninsula). This shallow tidal creek system is affected by effluents of organic matter and nutrients from the surrounding marine fish farms. Continuous pCO(2), salinity and temperature were recorded for four periods of approximately one month, between February and September in 2004. Major processes controlling the CO2 variability are related to three different time scales. Daily variations in fCO(2) are controlled by tidal advection and mixing of the water from within the creek and the seawater that enters from the Bay of Cadiz. Significant cyclical variations of the fCO(2) have been observed with the maximum values occurring at low tide. On a fortnightly time scale, the amplitude of the daily variability of fCO(2) is modulated by the variations in the residence time of the water within the creek, which are related to the spring-neap tide sequence. On a third time scale, high seasonal variability is observed for the temperature, salinity and fCO(2). Maximum and minimum values for fCO(2) were 380 mu atm and 3760 mu atm for February and July respectively. Data suggest that seasonal variability is related to the seasonal variability in discharges from the fish farm and to the increase with temperature of organic matter respiratory processes in the tidal creek. The fCO(2) values observed are in the same range as several highly polluted European estuaries or waters surrounding mangrove forests. From the air-water CO2 flux computed, it can be concluded that the Rio San Pedro acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere throughout the year, with the summer accounting for the higher average monthly flux.

TI  - Plant genotype controls wetland soil microbial functioning in response to sea-level rise
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can strongly alter soil microbial functioning via plant-microbe interactions, often with important consequences for ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant-microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress - i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem-climate feedbacks in the coastal zone.

TI  - Organic matter sources and rehabilitation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (California, USA)
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a complex mosaic of tidal Freshwater habitats in California. is the focus of a major ecosystem rehabilitation effort because of significant long-term changes in critical ecosystem functions. One of these functions is the production, transport and transformation of organic matter that constitutes the primary food supply, which may be sub-optimal at trophic levels supporting fish recruitment. A long historical data set is used to define the most important organic matter sources, the factors underlying their variability, and the implications of ecosystem rehabilitation actions for these sources.2. Tributary-borne loading is the largest organic carbon source on an average annual Delta-wide basis; phytoplankton production and agricultural drainage are secondary; wastewater treatment plant discharge, tidal marsh drainage and possibly aquatic macrophyte production are tertiary; and benthic microalgal production, urban run-off and other sources are negligible.3. Allochthonous dissolved organic carbon must be converted to particulate form-with losses due to hydraulic flushing and to heterotroph growth inefficiency-before it becomes available to the metazoan food web. When these losses are accounted for, phytoplankton production plays a much larger role than is evident from a simple accounting of bulk organic carbon sources, especially in seasons critical for larval development and recruitment success. Phytoplankton-derived organic matter is also an important component of particulate loading to the Delta.4. The Delta is a net producer of organic matter in critically dry years but, because of water diversion from the Delta, transport of organic matter from the Delta to important, downstream nursery areas in San Francisco Bay is always less than transport into the Delta from upstream sources.5. Of proposed rehabilitation measures, increased use of floodplains probably offers the biggest increase in organic matter sources.6. An isolated diversion facility-channelling water from the Sacramento River around the Delta to the water projects-would result in substantial loading increases during winter and autumn, but little change in spring and summer when food availability probably matters most to developing organisms.7. Flow and fish barriers in the channel could have significant effects, especially on phytoplankton sources and in dry years, by eliminating 'short-circuits' in the transport of organic matter to diversion points.8. Finally, productivity of intentionally flooded islands probably would exceed that of adjacent channels because of lower turbidity and shallower mean depth, although vascular plants rather than phytoplankton could dominate if depths were too shallow.

TI  - Nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean through submarine groundwater discharge: controls and potential impact
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nutrient input through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rivals river inputs in certain regions and may play a significant role in nutrient cycling and primary productivity in the coastal ocean. In this paper, we review the key factors determining the fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) associated with SGD and present a compilation of measured rates. We show that, in particular, the water residence time and the redox conditions in coastal aquifers and sediments determine fluxes and ratios of N and P in SGD. In many coastal groundwater systems, and especially in contaminated aquifers, N/P ratios exceed those in river water and are higher than the Redfield ratio. Thus, anthropogenically driven increases in SGD of nutrients have the potential to drive the N-limited coastal primary production to P-limitation. River input of N and P to the coastal ocean has doubled over the past 50 yr. Results of a dynamic biogeochemical model for the C, N and P cycles of the global proximal coastal ocean (which includes large bays, the open water part of estuaries, deltas, inland seas and salt marshes), suggest that this has led to a factor 2 increase in primary production and. biomass and a decline in water column N/P ratios i.e. the system has become more N-limiting. With the same model, we show that an increase of SGD-N fluxes to similar to0.7-1.1 Tmol yr(-1) (with a SGD N/P ratio of 100; equal to similar to45-70% of pre-human riverine N-inputs) is required to drive the coastal ocean to P-limitation within the next 50 yr.

TI  - Spatial and temporal changes of phosphorus in coastal wetland soils as affected by a tidal creek in the Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate spatial and temporal changes of soil phosphorus and its availability in coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Estuary, soil samples from five sampling sites (Sites 1-5) in four sampling periods were collected and the contents of soil phosphorus and other properties were detected. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils among the five sampling sites (p > 0.05), whereas significant differences were observed between June and other months (p < 0.05) following the order June > August > November > April. Generally, available phosphorus (AP) contents also showed a fluctuation in different sampling periods and there were significant differences between November and August and April at 10-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). The soil P supply was generally lower with lower AP:TP ratios less than 2%. Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter. The findings indicated that seasonal changes in soil P should be given more concerns to minimize the eutrophication risk of water bodies in coastal wetlands and guide the flow and sediment regulation regime of the upstream reservoir.

TI  - Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Carbon Paradox: CO2 Sinks or Sites of Terrestrial Carbon Incineration?
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 3
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Estuaries are a major boundary in the land-ocean interaction zone where organic carbon (OC) and nutrients are being processed, resulting in a high water-to-air carbon dioxide (CO2) flux (similar to 0.25 Pg C y(-1)). The continental shelves, however, take up CO2 (similar to 0.25 Pg C y(-1)) from the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 17% of open ocean CO2 uptake (1.5 Pg C y(-1)). It is demonstrated here that CO2 release in estuaries is largely supported by microbial decomposition of highly productive intertidal marsh biomass. It appears that riverine OC, however, would bypass the estuarine zone, because of short river-transit times, and contribute to carbon cycling in the ocean margins and interiors. Low-latitude ocean margins release CO2 because they receive two-thirds of the terrestrial OC. Because of recent CO2 increase in the atmosphere, CO2 releases from low latitudes have become weaker and CO2 uptake by mid- and high-latitude shelves has become stronger, thus leading to more dissolved inorganic carbon export to the ocean.

M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of sorptive inert surfaces on growth of marine bacteria and metabolism, as well as partitioning of organic substrates, were examined in microcosms inoculated with bacterioplankton from a local salt marsh. Introduction of organic-free glass beads to a dilute seawater medium (tryptic soy broth) increased yields of ATP, a surrogate for bacterial biomass, by 187% within the entire microcosm (attached + free-living). Growth efficiencies (bacterial C/media C) were 30% for bacteria grown in microcosms with beads compared with 16% without beads. Surface enrichment increased rates of proteolytic enzyme activity and cell-specific [H-3]leucine incorporation into protein by factors of 6.8 and 2.2, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy revealed obvious organic coatings on all beads after 2 h of exposure, but few strongly attached bacteria were evident, even after 40 h of exposure. Results support the hypothesis that mineral surfaces facilitate bacterial utilization of complex organic matter through physical-chemical processes that increase conversion efficiencies of labile substrate despite possible kinetic limitations. Furthermore, firm attachment by bacteria to these surfaces is apparently not a requirement to produce surface-enhanced activity.

TI  - Relationships Between Salinity and Short-Term Soil Carbon Accumulation Rates from Marsh Types Across a Landscape in the Mississippi River Delta
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity alterations will likely change the plant and environmental characteristics in coastal marshes thereby influencing soil carbon accumulation rates. Coastal Louisiana marshes have been historically classified as fresh, intermediate, brackish, or saline based on resident plant community and position along a salinity gradient. Short-term total carbon accumulation rates were assessed by collecting 10-cm deep soil cores at 24 sites located in marshes spanning the salinity gradient. Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates. Based on both analyses, the coastal Louisiana total marsh area (1,433,700 ha) accumulates about 2.7 to 3.3 Tg C year(-1). Changing salinities due to increasing relative sea level or resulting from restoration activities may alter carbon accumulation rates in the short term and significantly influence the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Detrital shadows: estuarine food web connectivity depends on fluvial influence and consumer feeding mode
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured the influence of landscape setting on estuarine food web connectivity in five macrotidal Pacific Northwest estuaries across a gradient of freshwater influence. We used stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34) in combination with a Bayesian mixing model to trace primary producer contributions to suspension-and deposit-feeding bivalve consumers (Mytilus trossulus and Macoma nasuta) transplanted into three estuarine vegetation zones: emergent marsh, mudflat, and eelgrass. Eelgrass includes both Japanese eelgrass (Zostera japonica) and native eelgrass (Zostera marina). Fluvial discharge and consumer feeding mode strongly influenced the strength and spatial scale of observed food web linkages, while season played a secondary role. Mussels displayed strong cross-ecosystem connectivity in all estuaries, with decreasing marine influence in the more fluvial estuaries. Mussel diets indicated homogenization of detrital sources within the water column of each estuary. In contrast, the diets of benthic deposit-feeding clams indicated stronger compartmentalization in food web connectivity, especially in the largest river delta where clam diets were trophically disconnected from marsh sources of detritus. This suggests detritus deposition is patchy across space, and less homogenous than the suspended detritus pool. In addition to fluvial setting, other estuary-specific environmental drivers, such as marsh area or particle transport speed, influenced the degree of food web linkages across space and time, often accounting for unexpected patterns in food web connectivity. Transformations of the estuarine landscape that alter river hydrology or availability of detritus sources can thus potentially disrupt natural food web connectivity at the landscape scale, especially for sedentary organisms, which cannot track their food sources through space.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to increase our understanding of the interaction of soil-halophyte (Salicornia brachiata) relations and phytoremediation, we investigated the aboveground biomass, carbon fixation, and nutrient composition (N, P, K, Na, Ca, and Mg) of S. brachiata using six sampling sites with varying characteristics over one growing season in intertidal marshes. Simultaneously, soil characteristics and nutrient concentrations were also estimated. There was a significant variation in soil characteristics and nutrient contents spatially (except pH) as well as temporally. Nutrient contents in aboveground biomass of S. brachiata were also significantly differed spatially (except C and Cl) as well as temporally. Aboveground biomass of S. brachiata ranged from 2.51 to 6.07 t/ha at maturity and it was positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and available Na, whereas negatively with soil pH. The K/Na ratio in plant was below one, showing tolerance to salinity. The aboveground C fixation values ranged from 0.77 to 1.93 C t/ha at all six sampling sites. This study provides new understandings into nutrient cycling-C fixation potential of highly salt-tolerant halophyte S. brachiata growing on intertidal soils of India. S. brachiata have a potential for amelioration of the salinity due to higher Na bioaccumulation factor.

TI  - Offspring sensitivity to ocean acidification changes seasonally in a coastal marine fish
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Experimental assessments of species vulnerabilities to ocean acidification are rapidly increasing in number, yet the potential for short-and long-term adaptation to high CO2 by contemporary marine organisms remains poorly understood. We used a novel experimental approach that combined bi-weekly sampling of a wild, spawning fish population (Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia) with standardized offspring CO2 exposure experiments and parallel pH monitoring of a coastal ecosystem. We assessed whether offspring produced at different times of the spawning season (April to July) would be similarly susceptible to elevated (similar to 1100 mu atm, pH(NIST) = 7.77) and high CO2 levels (similar to 2300 mu atm, pH(NIST) = 7.47). Early in the season (April), high CO2 levels significantly (p < 0.05) reduced fish survival by 54% (2012) and 33% (2013) and reduced 1 to 10 d post-hatch growth by 17% relative to ambient conditions. However, offspring from parents collected later in the season became increasingly CO2-tolerant until, by mid-May, offspring survival was equally high at all CO2 levels. This interannually consistent plasticity coincided with the rapid annual pH decline in the species' spawning habitat (mean pH: 1 April/31 May = 8.05/7.67). It suggests that parents can condition their offspring to seasonally acidifying environments, either via changes in maternal provisioning and/or epi genetic transgenerational plasticity (TGP). TGP to increasing CO2 has been shown in the laboratory but never before in a wild population. Our novel findings of direct CO2-related survival reductions in wild fish offspring and seasonally plastic responses imply that realistic assessments of species CO2-sensitivities must control for parental environments that are seasonally variable in coastal habitats.

TI  - The variability in CO2 fluxes at different time scales in natural and reclaimed wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary and their key influencing factors
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing pace of global warming, studies of the carbon cycle and carbon sink capacity of estuarine wetlands have received increasing attention. Estuarine wetlands are often located in economically developed and densely populated areas, and their reclamation has become an important way to acquire land resources. To explore the effect of reclamation on the carbon sink function of estuarine wetlands, the Chongming Dongtan reclaimed wetland and jiuduansha natural wetland, which are located in the Yangtze River estuary, were selected to investigate their variabilities in carbon fluxes and the main influencing factors using the open path eddy co-variance flux monitoring system. The CO2 uptake capacity of the Dongtan reclaimed wetland was significantly weaker than that of the Jiuduansha natural wetland (P < 0.05). The difference in carbon fluxes between the two wetlands was mainly influenced by plant growth and carbon fixation, which accounted for 70.7% of the variation, with soil respiration being the second most important factor. The soil water content and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the redaimed wetland significantly decreased due to the barrier to water flow presented by a dam (P < 0.01). Nitrogen limitation was the main reason for the poor plant growth in the reclaimed wetland. Although nitrogen inputs in the natural wetland promoted soil respiration (40.6%), they were overshadowed by the inhibitory effect of soil moisture and salinity (55.8%). It was therefore possible to improve the carbon sink function of reclaimed wetlands if plant growth and carbon fixation efficiency could be enhanced without promoting soil respiration.

TI  - Microbial Community Characteristics Largely Unaffected by X-Ray Computed Tomography of Sediment Cores
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning is used to study the physical characteristics of soil and sediment cores, allowing scientists to analyze stratigraphy without destroying core integrity. Microbiologists often work with geologists to understand the microbial properties in such cores; however, we do not know whether CT scanning alters microbial DNA such that DNA sequencing, a common method of community characterization, changes as a result of X-ray exposure. Our objective was to determine whether CT scanning affects the estimates of the composition of microbial communities that exist in cores. Sediment cores were extracted from a salt marsh and then submitted for CT scanning. We observed a minimal effect of CT scanning on microbial community composition in the sediment cores either when the cores were examined shortly after recovery from the field or after the cores had been stored for several weeks. In contrast, properties such as sediment layer and marsh location did affect microbial community structure. While we observed that CT scanning did not alter microbial community composition as a whole, we identified a few amplicon sequence variants (13 out of 7,037) that showed differential abundance patterns between scanned and unscanned samples among paired sample sets. Our overall conclusion is that the CT-scanning conditions typically used to obtain images for geological core characterization do not significantly alter microbial community structure. We stress that minimizing core exposure to X-rays is important if cores are to be studied for biological properties. Future investigations might consider variables, such as the length and energy of radiation exposure, the volume of the core, or the degree, to which microbial communities are stressed as important factors in assessing the impact of X-rays on microbes in geological cores.

CL  - Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD
AB  - The surface layer of marine sediments is an environment in transition: sediment added to the top of the layer transits to the bottom of the layer and is buried. A complex set of chemical reactions alters the sediment as it transits, lowering the free energy of the system. If a balance can be achieved between the rate of the reactions and the supply of the reactants, the distributions of reactants and reaction products can reach a steady state. Near the sediment-water interface the steady state is rarely achieved, and diagenesis proceeds via a succession of transient states that reflects variable external forcing and involves a multitude of redox reactions whose relative importance can vary in time and space. The transient state can be difficult to observe directly with conventional techniques, and much of what is known comes from indirect evidence. Development and application of new technologies for benthic research and monitoring are needed to advance our understanding of the time variable nature of sediment diagenesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecophysiological differences between genetic lineages facilitate the invasion of non-native Phragmites australis in North American Atlantic coast wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Over the last century, native Phragmites australis lineages have been almost completely replaced along the North American Atlantic coast by an aggressive lineage originating from Eurasia. Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate biological invasions is critical to better understand what makes an invasive species successful.2. Our objective was to determine what makes the introduced lineage so successful in the study area by specifically investigating if morphological and ecophysiological differences exist between native and introduced genetic lineages of P. australis. We hypothesized a priori that due to phenotypic differences and differences in plant nitrogen (N) content between lineages, the introduced lineage would have a greater photosynthetic potential.3. In situ ecophysiological and morphological data were collected for 2 years in a mid-Atlantic tidal marsh and in a glasshouse experiment. We measured photosynthetic parameters (A(max), water use efficiency, stomatal conductance) using infrared gas analysis, in conjunction with ecophysiological and morphological parameters [specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, chlorophyll content, N content].4. Introduced P. australis maintained 51% greater rates of photosynthesis and up to 100% greater rates of stomatal conductance which are magnified by its 38-83% greater photosynthetic canopy compared to the native type. The introduced lineage also had a significantly greater SLA and N content. Glasshouse-grown plants and naturally occurring populations demonstrated similar trends in ecophysiological characteristics, verifying the heritability of these differences. These ecophysiological differences, when combined with an extended growing season, provide the mechanism to explain the success of introduced P. australis in North America.5. Our findings suggest the native type is a low-nutrient specialist, with a more efficient photosynthetic mechanisms and lower N demand, whereas the introduced type requires nearly four times more N than the native type to be an effective competitor.6. Synthesis. Our study is the first to combine field and laboratory data to explain a biological invasion attributed to ecophysiological differences between genetic lineages. Our data corroborates earlier work suggesting anthropogenic modification of wetland environments has provided the state change necessary for the success of introduced P. australis. Finally, our results suggest that genotypic differences within species merit further investigations, especially when related to biological invasions.

TI  - PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY OF INVASIVE SPARTINA DENSIFLORA (POACEAE) ALONG A BROAD LATITUDINAL GRADIENT ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Premise of the study: Phenotypic acclimation of individual plants and genetic differentiation by natural selection within invasive populations are two potential mechanisms that may confer fitness advantages and allow plants to cope with environmental variation. The invasion of Spartina densiflora across a wide latitudinal gradient from California (USA) to British Columbia (Canada) provides a natural model system to study the potential mechanisms underlying the response of invasive populations to substantial variation in climate and other environmental variables.Methods: We examined morphological and physiological leaf traits of Spartina densiflora plants in populations from invaded estuarine sites across broad latitudinal and climate gradients along the Pacific west coast of North America and in favorable conditions in a common garden experiment.Key results: Our results show that key foliar traits varied widely among populations. Most foliar traits measured in the field were lower than would be expected under ideal growing conditions. Photosynthetic pigment concentrations at higher latitudes were lower than those observed at lower latitudes. Greater leaf rolling, reduced leaf lengths, and lower chlorophyll and higher carbon concentrations were observed with anoxic sediments. Lower chlorophyll to carotenoids ratios and reduced nitrogen concentrations were correlated with sediment salinity. Our results suggest that the variations of foliar traits recorded in the field are a plastic phenotypic response that was not sustained under common garden conditions.Conclusions: Spartina densiflora shows wide differences in its foliar traits in response to environmental heterogeneity in salt marshes, which appears to be the result of phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic differentiation.

TI  - Context-dependent consumer control in New England tidal wetlands
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies in coastal wetlands have indicated that consumers may play an important role in regulating large-scale ecosystem processes. Predator removal experiments have shown significant differences in above-ground biomass production in the presence of higher level consumers, or predators. These results indicate that predators play an important role in regulating biomass production, but the extent to which this regulation impacts additional ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and organic matter accumulation, is unclear. This study evaluated the impact that consumers have on large-scale ecosystem processes within southern New England tidal wetlands and contributes to the general understanding of trophic control in these systems. I established enclosure cages within three coastal wetlands and manipulated the presence of green crab predators to assess how trophic interactions affect ecosystem functions. Findings suggest that although these consumers may exert some top-down effects, other environmental factors, such as other consumers not studied here or bottom-up interactions, may variably play a larger role in the maintenance of ecosystem processes within the region. These results indicate that the loss of top-down control as an important mechanism influencing ecosystem functions may not hold for all wetlands along the full extent of the New England coastline.

TI  - EFFECT OF THE LONG-TERM ELEVATION OF CO2 CONCENTRATION IN THE FIELD ON THE QUANTUM YIELD OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF THE C3 SEDGE, SCIRPUS-OLNEYI
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - CO2 concentration was elevated throughout 3 years around stands of the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi on a tidal marsh of the Chesapeake Bay.  The hypothesis that tissues developed in an elevated CO2 atmosphere will show an acclimatory decrease in photosynthetic capacity under light-limiting conditions was examined.  The absorbed light quantum yield of CO2 uptake (phi-abs and the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry were determined for plants which had developed in open top chambers with CO2 concentrations in air of 680 micromoles per mole, and of 351 micromoles per mole as controls.  An Ulbricht sphere cuvette incorporated into an open gas exchange system was used to determine phi-abs and a portable chlorophyll fluorimeter was used to estimate the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II.  When measured in an atmosphere with 10 millimoles per mole O2 to suppress photorespiration, shoots showed a phi-abs of 0.093 +/- 0.003, with no statistically significant difference between shoots grown in elevated or control CO2 concentrations.  Efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry was also unchanged by development in an elevated CO2 atmosphere.  Shoots grown and measured in 680 micromoles per mole of CO2 in air showed a phi-abs of 0.078 +/- 0.004 compared with O.065 +/- 0.003 for leaves grown and measured in 351 micromoles per mole CO2 in air; a highly significant increase.  In accordance with the change in phi-abs, the light compensation point of photosynthesis decreased from 51 +/- 3 to 31 +/- 3 micromoles per square meter per second for stems grown and measured in 351 and 680 micromoles per mole of CO2 in air, respectively.  The results suggest that even after 3 years of growth in elevated CO2, there is no evidence of acclimation in capacity for photosynthesis under light-limited conditions which would counteract the stimulation of photosynthetic CO2 uptake otherwise expected through decreased photorespiration.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Vertical and lateral variability of organic geochemical parameters was established for the Seam 4 of the Fila Maestra coal deposit (Quebradon Formation, Oligocene-Early Miocene age) through the study of coals and carbonaceous shales collected in different outcrops of the coal seam. Chemical and physical analysis included moisture and ash contents, maceral groups, vitrinite reflectance, total carbon, bitumen and its fractions, as well as characterization of saturated hydrocarbons by gas chromatography (n-alkane distributions and pristane/phytane ratios). A production sample, representative of the Seam 4, was further analyzed for S, Cl, C, H, O and its calorific value determined. The data collected allowed us to classify these samples as high-volatile bituminous coals, types B and C, according to ASTM classification.The results of the analysis showed little vertical or lateral variation in the properties studied. A gradual increase in ash content in the westward direction, together with a thinning of the coal seam, suggest a greater proximity of the basin border in this direction. High values in pristane/phytane ratio (4-7), predominance of heavy alkanes and high contents in vitrinites clearly indicates that primigenic organic matter was essentially continental in character. However, the bimodal n-alkane distribution, together with a high sulfur (2.7%) and chlorine (0.12%) contents suggest a marine-influenced environment. In consequence, it is proposed that these coals were formed in a transitional environment, as salt-marshs in coastal lagoons or in low deltaic plains. These results are in agreement with the stratigraphic analysis of the sedimentary unit.

TI  - Concentrations, turnover rates and fluxes of polyamines in coastal waters of the South Atlantic Bight
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyamines are short-chain aliphatic compounds containing multiple amine groups. They are important components of the cytosol of eukaryotes and are present at mmol L-1 concentrations inside phytoplankton cells, while complex polyamines play a role in biosilica deposition. Concentrations of polyamines measured in seawater are typically in the sub-nmol L-1 range, implying rapid and efficient uptake by osmotrophs, likely bacterioplankton. We measured turnover rates of three polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) using H-3-labeled compounds and determined their concentrations by HPLC to estimate polyamine contributions to dissolved organic matter and bacterioplankton carbon and nitrogen demand. These measurements were made on transects from the inner shelf to the Gulf Stream across the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) during April and October of 2011 and in salt marsh estuaries on the Georgia coast during August of 2011 and April of 2012. We found that turnover rates of polyamines were similar to those of amino acids (arginine and glutamic acid) measured in the same samples; however, fluxes of polyamines into bacterioplankton were much lower than amino acid fluxes as a result of low ambient concentrations. Turnover rates and fluxes of polyamines decreased from near-shore waters to the shelf-break, following the pattern of chlorophyll a concentration. Polyamine uptake accounted for less than 10 % of bacterial N demand and 5 % of bacterial C demand on average, with a large variation among water masses.

TI  - Metal Bioaccumulation by Estuarine Food Webs in New England, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the degree of metal exposure and bioaccumulation in estuarine organisms is important for understanding the fate of metals in estuarine food webs. We investigated the bioaccumulation of Hg, methylmercury (MeHg), Cd, Se, Pb, and As in common intertidal organisms across a watershed urbanization gradient of coastal marsh sites in New England to relate metal exposure and bioaccumulation in fauna to both chemical and ecological factors. In sediments, we measured metal and metalloid concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) and SEM-AVS (Simultaneously extracted metal-acid volatile sulfides). In five different functional feeding groups of biota, we measured metal concentrations and delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures. Concentrations of Hg and Se in biota for all sites were always greater than sediment concentrations whereas Pb in biota was always lower. There were positive relationships between biota Hg concentrations and sediment concentrations, and between biota MeHg concentrations and both pelagic feeding mode and trophic level. Bioavailability of all metals measured as SEM-AVS or Benthic-Sediment Accumulation Factor was lower in more contaminated sites, likely due to biogeochemical factors related to higher levels of sulfides and organic carbon in the sediments. Our study demonstrates that for most metals and metalloids, bioaccumulation is metal specific and not directly related to sediment concentrations or measures of bioavailability such as AVS-SEM.

TI  - Coastal wetland responses to a century of climate change in northern Sahara, Morocco
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Coastal wetlands are highly sensitive to changes occurring at the coastline. It is critically important to determine region-specific projections for these areas due to their specificities and vulnerabilities to climate change. This work aimed to value the impacts of recent climate changes at West Africa Sahara coastland, southern Morocco, at Khnifiss Lagoon. We have applied a combined approach using remote sensing techniques and environmental reconstructions based on high-resolution analysis of sediment cores, covering the current warm period. Remote sensing highlighted changes to the lagoon inlet, accompanied by a greater meandering character of the tidal channels. As a response, the sediment cores have recorded a predominant vegetation substitution due to changes in the tidal limit, and an increase in organic carbon accumulation was observed. For the current climatology, during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, winds reaching the coast strengthen in an east-to-west direction. In the Khnifiss Lagoon, whose inlet is dominated by the ebb tide, the intensity and direction of the winds on the coast at surface level modifies its connection to the ocean by increasing sediment transport toward the interior of the lagoon. Locally biological responses to wind intensification, and possibly sea-level rise, exemplify the lagoon sensitivity to large-scale processes. Coastal vegetated wetlands are considered to be highly dynamic environments. However, we expect a loss of the upper tidal vegetation due to boundary conditions limiting the accommodation space in this arid environment in a possible future scenario of continuously inland tidal line displacement.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon exchange and nitrogen removal rates in two 33-year-old constructed salt marshes are similar to those in a nearby natural marsh
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have led to 1-2% of coastal wetlands lost per year globally, with subsequent losses in ecosystem services such as nutrient filtering and carbon sequestration. Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.

TI  - Salt marsh pore water geochemistry does not correlate with microbial community structure
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal trends in pore water geochemistry and sediment microbial community structure are compared at three intertidal sites of a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA. The sites include a heavily bioturbated, unvegetated creek bank, a levee with dense growth of Spartina alterniflora. and a more sparsely vegetated ponded marsh site. The redox chemistry of the pore waters ranges from sulfide-dominated at the ponded marsh site to suboxic at the creek bank site. At the three sites. the vertical redox stratification of the pore waters is more compressed in summer than in winter. The trends in redox chemistry reflect opposing effects of sediment respiration and pore water irrigation. Intense and deep burrowing activity by fiddler crabs at the creek bank site results in the efficient oxidation of reduced byproducts of microbial metabolism and, hence, the persistence of suboxic conditions to depths of 50 cm below the sediment surface. Increased supply of labile organic substrates at the vegetated sites promotes microbial degradation processes. leading to sharper redox gradients. At the levee site, this is partly offset by the higher density and deeper penetration of roots and macrofaunal burrows. Surprisingly, the microbial community structure shows little correlation with the variable vertical redox zonation of the pore waters across the saltmarsh. At the three sites, the highest population densities of aerobic microorganisms, iron- plus manganese-reducing bacteria, and sulfate reducers coexist within the upper 10 cm of sediment. The absence of a clear vertical separation of these microorganisms is ascribed to the hi It supply of labile organic matter and intense mixing of the topmost sediment via bioturbation.

TI  - Sources of Terrestrial Organic Carbon in the Mississippi Plume Region: Evidence for the Importance of Coastal Marsh Inputs
T2  - AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - High sedimentation rates along river-dominated margins make these systems important repositories for organic carbon derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. Using elemental carbon/nitrogen ratios, molecular biomarker (lignin phenol), and stable carbon isotopic (bulk and compound-specific) analyses, this study examined the sources of organic carbon to the Louisiana shelf within one of the primary dispersive pathways of the Mississippi River. Surface sediment samples were collected from stations across the inner, mid, and outer Louisiana shelf, within the Mississippi River plume region, during two cruises in the spring and fall of 2000. Lignin biomarker data showed spatial patterns in terrestrial source plant materials within the river plume, such that sediments near the mouth of the Mississippi River were comparatively less degraded and richer in C-4 plant carbon than those found at mid-depth regions of the shelf. A molecular and stable isotope-based mixing model defining riverine, marsh, and marine organic carbon suggested that the highest organic carbon inputs to the shelf in spring were from marine sources (55-61% marine organic carbon), while riverine organic carbon was the highest (63%) in fall, likely due to lower inputs of marine organic carbon at this time compared with the spring season. This model also indicated that marsh inputs, ranging from 19 to 34% and 3-15% of the organic carbon in spring and fall, respectively, were significantly more important sources of organic carbon on the inner Louisiana shelf than previously suggested. Finally, we propose that the decomposition of terrestrial-derived organic carbon (from the river and local wetlands sources) in mobile muds may serve as a largely unexplored additional source of oxygen-consuming organic carbon in hypoxic bottom waters of the Louisiana shelf.

TI  - Application of feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms for saltmarsh biomass estimation using Worldview-2 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing large scale plant productivity of coastal marshes is essential to understand the resilience of these systems to climate change. Two machine learning approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) regression were tested to estimate biomass of a common saltmarshes species, salt couch grass (Sporobolus virginicus). Reflectance and vegetation indices derived from 8 bands of Worldview-2 multispectral data were used for four experiments to develop the biomass model. These four experiments were, Experiment-1: 8 bands of Worldview-2 image, Experiment-2: Possible combination of all bands of Worldview-2 for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) type vegetation indices, Experiment-3: Combination of bands and vegetation indices, Experiment-4: Selected variables derived from experiment-3 using variable selection methods. The main objectives of this study are (i) to recommend an affordable low cost data source to predict biomass of a common saltmarshes species, (ii) to suggest a variable selection method suitable for multispectral data, (iii) to assess the performance of RF and SVM for the biomass prediction model. Cross-validation of parameter optimizations for SVM showed that optimized parameter of e-SVR failed to provide a reliable prediction. Hence, nu-SVR was used for the SVM model. Among the different variable selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE) selected a minimum number of variables (only 4) with an RMSE of 0.211 (kg/m2). Experiment-4 (only selected bands) provided the best results for both of the machine learning regression methods, RF (R-2= 0.72, RMSE= 0.166 kg/m2) and SVR (R-2= 0.66, RMSE = 0.200 kg/m2) to predict biomass. When a 10-fold cross validation of the RF model was compared with a 10-fold cross validation of SVR, a significant difference (p = <0.0001) was observed for RMSE. One to one comparisons of actual to predicted biomass showed that RF underestimates the high biomass values, whereas SVR overestimates the values; this suggests a need for further investigation and refinement.

TI  - Trophodynamics of estuarine intertidal harpacticoid copepods based on stable isotope composition and fatty acid profiles
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trophic interactions at the basis of food webs, for instance between meiofauna, primary producers and bacteria, are key drivers of benthic energy fluxes. Yet both qualitative and quantitative information about meiofaunal resource utilization under in situ conditions is scant. By means of natural stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen and of fatty acid (FA) profiles, we examined the variability of in situ resource utilization of a range of harpacticoid copepod species from 5 stations in an estuarine intertidal area. These stations, located in different habitats, differed in sediment granulometry, resource availability, presence/absence of vegetation and other environmental variables, as well as in copepod species composition. Our goal was to describe interspecific differences among harpacticoid species, as well as spatio-temporal variability within species. Despite differences in resource availability between habitats, delta C-13 data clearly point at microphytobenthos (MPB) as the major carbon source to the harpacticoid assemblages at all 5 stations. Small differences in carbon isotopic ratios between co-occurring species indicate some degree of resource differentiation, whereas both the delta N-15 and FA composition suggest that several harpacticoid species obtain MPB carbon indirectly, perhaps through feeding on bacteria or ciliates. For a limited number of species, such as Paraleptastacus spinicauda, clear dietary contributions of suspended particulate matter and bacteria were found, and MPB appeared to have only a small or no contribution. Even in vegetated salt-marsh stations, Spartina anglica detritus did not appear to contribute to copepod diets. The delta C-13 of Cletodidae were highly depleted, reflecting a contribution of methane-derived carbon.

TI  - Variability of metal contents in the sea rush Juncus maritimus - estuarine sediment system through one year of plant's life
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal accumulation by Juncus maritimus and the effect this plant might have on the physicochemical composition of sediments, from Douro river estuary (NW Portugal), were investigated through one year of plant's life. The contents of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes) and different tissues of J. maritimus. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied, one a sandy sediment with relatively low organic matter content, the other a muddy site. The role of the plant seemed to be markedly dependent on the sediment composition. At the sandy site, significant variations throughout the year (a decrease from winter to summer and an increase in autumn) either in rhizosediment and sediment or in J. maritimus roots were only observed in Cd and Cu levels. These variations were the same in both compartments, probably caused by tidal water movements and the activity of the plant. At the muddy site, variations throughout the year were observed for all studied elements but Pb. Changes in the Cd and Zn contents of roots were opposite to those in the rhizosediment (uptake of Cd and Zn by J maritimus roots in summer may have caused a decrease in rhizosediment levels). Fe and Mn showed similar patterns of variation in both roots and rhizosediment (contents significantly increasing in summer). Higher contents of Fe and Mn in roots in summer could be related to changes in mass, higher availability of the elements, or accumulation at the surface of the root in (hydr)oxides forms. For the remaining elements no significant correlations between rhizosediment and roots variations were observed, indicating that their uptake and release by roots were not based on single exchanges with the sediment. J. maritimus showed capacity to accumulate Cu, Zn and particularly Cd, thus appearing to be useful for the phytostabilization of these metals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Utility of radium quartet for evaluating porewater-derived carbon to a saltmarsh nearshore water: Implications for blue carbon export
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are global hotspots of carbon sequestration and storage and are known as effective blue carbon ecosystems. However, the role of porewater exchange in saltmarshes as a source of carbon to the nearshore waters is still poorly constrained. Herein, we examined the radium quartet, dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in the porewater and nearshore surface water of Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh, China. Multiple methods based on the radium quartet were applied to estimate the porewater exchange, including the three-endmember model, mass balance model and time series observation. All methods revealed that the porewater exchange rate in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh equaled 3.37 +/- 1.23 cm d(-1). The porewater-derived DIC and DOC fluxes were then estimated to be (151 +/- 0.64) x 10(7) and (9.97 +/- 6.96) x 10(5) mol d(-1), respectively, which correspondingly made up 64.6% and 35.6%, of the total inputs into the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh nearshore water. Considering the intertidal area covered by saltmarsh vegetation, carbon export through the porewater exchange was 3.87 +/- 1.55 g C m(-2) d(-1), and was 1.2-fold greater than the carbon burial rate, accounting for approximately 29% of carbon outwelling in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh. This study highlights the significance of porewater exchange for evaluating carbon sequestration capacity, and suggests that porewater exchange should not be overlooked in blue carbon assessments of saltmarshes.

TI  - Geochemical survey and metal bioaccumulation of three bivalve species (Crassostrea gigas, Cerastoderma edule and Ruditapes philippinarum) in the Nord Medoc salt marshes (Gironde estuary, France)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A 15-month experiment combining a geochemical survey of Cd, Cu, Zn and Fig with a bioaccumulation study for three filter-feeding bivalve species (oysters, Crassostrea gigas; cockles, Cerastoderma edule; and clams, Ruditapes philippinarum) was conducted in a breeding basin of the Nord Medoc salt marshes connected to the Gironde estuary, which is affected by historic polymetallic pollution. Regular manual surface measurements of temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved O-2 concentration and hourly multiprobe in situ measurements throughout several periods for 6-8 weeks were performed. The geochemical behavior of metals in water, suspended particulate matter and sediment and their ecotoxicological impact on the three bivalve species were evaluated by in situ exposure of juvenile oysters (water column) and adult cockles and clams (sediment surface).The physico-chemical parameters reflected seasonal variations and basin management. A distinct daily periodicity (except salinity) indicated intense photosynthesis and respiration. In summer, low dissolved O-2 saturations (similar to 40-50%) occurred in the early morning at 30 cm above the sediment, whereas in depressions, the water column near the sediment surface was suboxic. Cadmium, Zn and Cu concentrations in suspended particulate matter exceeded typical estuarine values and were much higher than the homogeneously distributed concentrations in different depth ranges of the basin sediment. Particles collected in sediment traps showed intermediate metal concentrations close to sediment values. These results suggest trace metal recycling due to reductive dissolution under suboxic conditions at the sediment surface resulting in trace metal release to the water column and adsorption onto suspended particles. Dissolved Cd, Zn and Hg concentrations (e.g. 13-136 ng 1(-1); 0.3-25.1 mug 1(-1) and 0.5-2.0 ng 1(-1), respectively) in the basin corresponded to the concentration range typically observed in the Gironde estuary, except for some maximum values attributed to metal recycling. In contrast, dissolved Cu concentrations (1.08-6.08 mug 1(-1)) were mostly higher than typical estuarine values, probably due to recycled Cu complexation by dissolved organic matter. Growth, bioaccumulation rates and kinetics in the whole soft body of the bivalves were analyzed every 40 days. Although Cd bioaccumulation of oysters was lower in the basin than in the estuary during the same period (27,000 ng g(-1), dry weight and 40,000 ng g(-1), respectively) these values are largely above the new human consumption safety level (5000 ng g(-1), dw; European Community, 2002). For cockles and clams, Cd bioaccumulation was lower, reaching 1400 ng g(-1) and 950 ng g(-1), respectively. Similar results were obtained for Zn and Cu suggesting physiological differences between the species and/or differences in the exposure of the organisms due to physico-chemical conditions and metal distribution between dissolved and particulate phases. In contrast, Hg bioaccumulation was highest for cockles reaching bioconcentration factors of similar to 200,000, which even exceeded that of Cd in oysters (50,000) for the same exposition period. Nevertheless, Hg concentrations remained relatively low in the three bivalve species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora Lois. is a dominant species growing in intermediate and saline marshes of the US Gulf coast and Atlantic coastal marshes. S. alterniflora plants were subjected to a range of soil redox potential (Eh) conditions representing a well aerated to reduced conditions in a rhizotron system under controlled environmental conditions. The low soil Eh resulted in inhibition of root elongation shortly after treatment initiation. Root elongation was reduced as soil Eh approached values below ca. +350 mV. Substantial decrease in root elongation was noted when soil Eh fell below +200 mV. Generally, net photosynthetic rate (P-N) decreased as soil Eh was reduced, with substantial reductions in P-N found when Eh approached negative values. Average P-N was reduced to 87, 64, and 44 % of control under +340, +245, and -180 mV treatments, respectively, The reductions in root elongation and P-N in response to low soil Eh indicated the adverse effects of low soil Eh on plant functioning and the need for periods of soil aeration that allow plants to resume normal functioning. Thus periods of drainage allowing soil aeration during the growing season appear to be critical to S. alterniflora by providing favorable conditions for root growth and gas exchange with important implications for plant carbon fixation.

TI  - Assessing food web dynamics and relative importance of organic matter sources for fish species in two Portuguese estuaries: A stable isotope approach
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) were used to analyse food web dynamics of two of the main estuaries of the Portuguese coast: Tejo and Mira. The ultimate sources of organic matter supporting production of some of the most abundant and commercially important fish species were determined: and seasonal, inter- and intra- estuarine differences in the trophic relations among producers and consumers were identified. Stable isotope analysis was performed in different producers, primary consumers (main prey items for fish) and fish species (Solea solea, Solea senegalensis, Pomatoschistus microps, Dicentrarchus labrax, Liza ramada, Diplodus vulgaris and Atherina presbyter) of two areas in each estuary, in July and October 2009. Model calculations showed that the main prey for the fish species in the Tejo estuary used mostly salt marsh-derived organic matter as nutritional sources, with no marked differences between the sampled months. Trophic levels of fish species from the same estuary differed at multiple scales: inter-species, seasonally and spatially (both between and within estuaries). Significant differences in isotopic composition of fish species were more pronounced spatially (between the two sampled areas in the estuary) than seasonally (between sampled months). Trophic relationships in both estuaries demonstrated that organic matter is transferred to higher trophic positions mainly through benthic pathways. This shows the flexibility of these species to share resources and to exploit temporary peaks in prey populations. The present results showed that extensive disturbance in intertidal habitats from both estuaries may potentially change the balance of organic matter in the base of these complex food webs.

TI  - Soil Development in a Coastal Louisiana Wetland during a Climate-Induced Vegetation Shift from Salt Marsh to Mangrove
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mild winter temperatures are facilitating the expansion of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) into smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico. These expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error [SE]: 0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 %), or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on autochthonous soil development. In the highly disturbed region of Fourchon, Louisiana, the shift from Spartina marshes to scrub Avicennia stands does not appear to affect the chemistry of soil development.

AB  - Leaf energy budgets were constructed for 13 species of estuarine C-4 grasses (Poaceae) to elucidate the biophysical effects of drought and salinity on the interception and dissipation of solar energy. Spartina alterniflora, S. anglica, S. argentinensis, S. bakeri, S. cynosuroides, S. densiflora, S. foliosa, S. foliosa x S. alterniflora hybrids, S. gracilis, S. patens, S. pectinata, S. spartinae, and Distichlis spicata plants were grown under controlled soil water potential gradients in a greenhouse. Species were grouped into four major ecological functional types, based on elevational zonation ranges: low marsh species, middle marsh species, high marsh species, and freshwater species. Different functional types are adapted to different environmental conditions, and responded differently to reduced water potentials. Latent heat flux decreased similarly across species in response to decreasing water potential. Latent heat loss was found to decrease by as much as 65% under decreasing water potential, leading to an increase in leaf temperature of up to 4 degrees C. Consequently, radiative and sensible heat losses increased under decreasing water potential. Sensible heat flux increased as much as 336% under decreasing water potential. Latent heat loss appeared to be an important mode of temperature regulation in all species, and sensible heat loss appeared to be more important in high marsh species compared to low marsh species. High marsh species are characterized by narrower leaves than middle and low marsh species, leading to a smaller boundary layer, and providing higher conductance to sensible heat loss. This may be an adaptation for high marsh species to regulate leaf temperature without access to large amounts of water for transpirational cooling. Stomatal conductance decreased with decreasing water potential across species: leaf conductances to water vapor and CO2 decreased as much as 69% under decreasing water potential. Additionally, oxidative stress appeared to increase in these plants during times of drought or salinity stress. Ascorbate peroxidase activities increased with decreasing soil water potential, indicating increased cellular reactive oxygen species. High marsh species had higher ascorbate peroxidase activities compared to low marsh species, indicating higher tolerance to drought- or salinity-induced stresses. It was concluded that different species of marsh grasses are adapted for growth in different zones of salt marshes. Adaptations include biophysical, biochemical, and morphological traits that optimize heat exchange with the environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tracing the intrusion of fossil carbon into coastal Louisiana macrofauna using natural C-14 and C-13 abundances
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released a large volume of C-13 and radiocarbon depleted organic matter to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of petroleum-derived carbon entering the offshore planktonic foodweb, as well as widespread oiling of coastal areas documented in previous studies suggests that hydrocarbons could have entered the near shore foodweb. To test this hypothesis, we measured radiocarbon (Delta C-14%) and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in an assortment of fish tissue, invertebrate tissue and shell samples collected within a year of the spill at seven sites from Louisiana to Florida USA across the northern Gulf of Mexico. We observed a west-east gradient with the most depleted radiocarbon values found in Terrebonne Bay, Louisana and increasingly enriched radiocarbon values in organisms collected at sites to the east. Depleted radiocarbon values as low as - 10% in invertebrate soft tissue from Terrebonne suggest assimilation of fossil carbon (2.8 +/- 1.2%), consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter from petrochemical reservoirs released during the Deepwater Horizon spill entered the coastal food web to a limited extent. Further there was a significant correlation between radiocarbon and delta C-13 values in invertebrate tissue consistent with this hypothesis. Both oyster tissue and hard head catfish tissue collected in impacted areas of coastal Louisiana were significantly depleted in C-14 and C-13 relative to organisms collected in the unaffected Apalachicola Bay, Florida (p < 0.014). Alternative explanations for these results include the influence of chronic hydrocarbon pollution along the western gulf coast or that the organisms ingest carbon derived from C-14 depleted organic matter mobilized during the erosion of coastal marshes in southern Louisiana.

TI  - Microbial biofilms as indicators of estuarine condition.
T2  - Abstracts of the General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology
M3  - Meeting
CP  - 103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting
CL  - Washington, DC, USA
AB  - Microbial biofilms are complex communities of bacteria, protozoa, microalgae, and micrometazoa in a polymer matrix on submerged surfaces. Their development is integrative of environmental conditions, being affected by local biodiversity, the availability of organic matter and inorganic nutrients (bottom-up), and the presence or absence of biofilm grazers (top-down). We seek to utilize information content of microbial biofilms where they develop as indicators of ecosystem status. Our two major hypotheses are: 1) microbial biofilms will exhibit habitat specificity as a result of top-down and bottom-up controls of community structure and function, and 2) the integrative nature of the biofilms will reflect conditions of specific habitats as a result of changes to top-down and bottom-up forces. Various endpoints of community structure and function include bulk chemical characterization, total heterotrophic activity, phosphatase activity, nitrogen fixation/denitrification rates, phospholipid methyl ester profiles, and molecular probing for diversity of organisms and expression patterns of genes coding for enzymes associated with biogeochemical cycling. Initial results suggest that these microbial communities, developed on standardized acrylic plate samplers, have habitat fidelity, even within short spatial scales. Total material by carbon, nitrogen, protein, carbohydrate, lipid and DNA content, or optical density of dried biofilms show dramatic differences for oyster reef vs. non-oyster reef and salt marsh vs. open water habitats. Spatial variability within biofilms assessed by optical density may be a useful indicator at a gross scale of analysis, while phospholipid patterns appear to provide better resolution. We optimized extraction of nucleic acids from microbial biofilms by comparison of a variety of commercial and traditional procedures, based on total DNA yield and relative proportion of high molecular weight DNA.

TI  - Fungal farming in a snail
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mutualisms between fungi and fungus-growing animals are model systems for studying coevolution and complex interactions between species. Fungal growing behavior has enabled cultivating animals to rise to major ecological importance, but evolution of farming symbioses is thought to be restricted to three terrestrial insect lineages. Surveys along 2,000 km of North America's Atlantic coast documented that the marine snail Littoraria irrorata grazes fungus-infected wounds on live marsh grass throughout its range. Field experiments demonstrate a facultative, farming mutualism between Littoraria and intertidal fungi. Snails graze live grass primarily not to feed but to prepare substrate for fungal growth and consume invasive fungi. Fungal removal experiments show that snails and fungi act synergistically to suppress marsh grass production. These results provide a case of fungus farming in the marine environment and outside the class Insecta and reveal a previously undemonstrated ecological mechanism (i.e., facilitation of fungal invasion) by which grazers can exert top-down control of marine plant production.

TI  - Tracing estuarine organic matter sources into the southern North Sea using C and N isotopic signatures
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sources and distribution of particulate organic matter in surface waters of the Humber and Thames estuaries and in the East Anglian plume in the southern North Sea were investigated in winter 2006/2007. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes provided evidence for the presence of three particulate organic matter sources; riverine plankton (delta C-13 -30 aEuro degrees and delta N-15 7.9 aEuro degrees) identified in the Thames estuary only, marine plankton (average delta C-13 -21.4 aEuro degrees and delta N-15 4.5 aEuro degrees) and a third source with an enriched C-13 signature (>-16.7 aEuro degrees) and elevated C:N ratio (> 12.7). Particulate organic matter with enriched C-13 values were observed throughout the Humber estuary and at the marine end-member of the Thames estuary. While bacterial cycling of organic carbon undoubtedly takes place within these estuaries, these processes on their own are unlikely to account for the isotopic signatures seen. The C-13 enriched organic matter source is suggested to be due to particulate organic matter input from marsh plants and seagrasses such as Spartina spp. and Zostera on the adjacent salt marshes and mudflats and/or macroalgae along the banks of the estuaries. This C-13 enriched signal was also identified approximately 50 km offshore within the southern North Sea, in the East Anglian plume, which transports UK riverine water off-shore in a discrete plume. This plume therefore provides a mechanism to transport this estuarine derived organic matter pool offshore out of the estuaries. These results indicate that estuarine derived organic matter from marsh plants, seagrasses and/or macroalgae contributes to the southern North Sea organic matter pool and is therefore likely to contribute to winter-time shelf sea carbon and nitrogen cycles.

TI  - Litter decomposition of Scirpus maritimus L. in a Mediterranean coastal marsh: Importance of the meiofauna during the initial phases of detached leaves decomposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Meeting on Plant Litter Processing in Freshwaters
CL  - Toulouse, FRANCE
AB  - Growth, senescence and decomposition rates of Scirpus maritimus were studied in a Mediterranean brackish wetland. Plant tussocks were tagged in March, 2002 and were totally dead by September, 2002. Decomposition rates were determined over 360 days using litter bag technique and mass loss, nutrient dynamics fungal biomass, meiofauna and macroorganisms were determined. Decomposition rate of detached S. maritimus litter was 0.00196 (k, day(-1)) with a 54% of mass lost observed in 1 year. The pattern of mass loss was characterized by an initial phase of fast loss of organic matter with high density of meiofauna and a decrease of oxygen content, followed by two slower phases, with no significant losses from 50 to 180 days and with 21% of mass lost from 180 to 360 days. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of plant litter increased during decomposition process whereas atomic C:N and C: P ratios decreased suggesting a nutrient immobilization on plant detritus. Fungal biomass measured as ergosterol content decreased after submersion of leaves, indicating that their importance in litter decomoposition decreases in submerged leaves during the first days of decomposition. An inverse relationship (r=-0.79, P < 0.005) was observed between ergosterol content and nematodes density on S. maritimus litter. Our results suggest that in Mediterranean brackish marshes, where large amounts of dead organic matter is accumulated over the sediment surface, decomposition process is greatly affected by extremely high temperatures in summer that, if water is available, accelerates microbial activity decreasing oxygen content thus slowing decomposition.

TI  - Distribution of juvenile Uca pugnax and U-pugilator across habitats in a South Carolina estuary, assessed by molecular techniques
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Uca pugnax and U. pugilator are common fiddler crabs in salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States. As adults, U. pugnax frequent muddier, vegetated (typically Spartina alterniflora) substrate while U. pugilator usually occupy sandier, open habitats. It is unclear where juvenile U. pugnax and U. pugilator reside because the early crab stages of these species are difficult to identify by simple gross morphology. Using a novel restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) protocol to distinguish postlarval U. pugnax and U. pugilator, we studied their distribution along a horizontal gradient in the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina. We collected juvenile crabs along transects at 3 different sites that spanned S. alterniflora-covered mud and open sand habitats with adult populations of U. pugnax and U. pugilator, respectively. Over 75% of the juveniles collected were U. pugnax, showing greater recruitment by this species. U. pugnax juveniles of all sizes preferred the same muddy habitat occupied by adults, but habitat preferences of juvenile U. pugilator varied by site. Generally, U. pugilator displayed a shift in distribution from S. alterniflora cover to sandier habitat during early juvenile stages. The younger stages may prefer S. alterniflora-covered, muddier habitat because it provides better cover from predators, or so that they can avoid displacement by currents during high tides; alternatively, they may be able to feed better on muddy sediment. U. pugilator develops specialized mouthparts to scrape organic matter from larger sand grains, but these are not present in early juveniles nor in U. pugnax juveniles. Although young juvenile U. pugnax strongly favored S. alterniflora cover, older juveniles (those large enough to dig burrows for protection) were occasionally found in sandier habitat with U. pugilator.

TI  - Composition of size-fractioned sedimentary organic matter in coastal environments is affected by difference in physical forcing strength
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in three different depositional environments in south Texas and dominated by vascular plant input was investigated. Sediments were collected from McGuill Lake, a small freshwater lake, and two salt marsh sites in Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, and size-fractioned by wet sieving. Physical forcing or energy, indicated by tides, tidal current, and wind and wind fetch area, is weakest in the lake, intermediate strength at the Nueces Delta, and strongest at Copano Bay. Results from total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) and n-alkane analysis, and C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) showed that the SOM from all three sites became more degraded towards finer size fractions, from > 300 mu m, 300-125 mu m, 125-63 mu m, 63-32 mu m to < 32 mu m. Relative to the coarse fractions, the fine fractions were enriched in the degradation indicator gamma-aminobutyric acid, and in aliphatic and proteinaceous components, as shown from NMR spectra and lower C/N ratio values. This degradation pattern of SOM with size is typical for sediments from coastal and lacustrine environments. However, the contents of organic carbon (OC), THAAs and n-alkanes were higher in sandy fractions than in silt and clay fractions from McGuill Lake sediment, suggesting that the SOM was relatively undegraded in coarse fractions. The size distribution of OM in the lake could be explained by the weak physical forcing, which may not easily break down coarser plant detritus into smaller pieces. The trend contrasted with degradation patterns for sediments from Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, where SOM was concentrated in the < 32 mu m fraction, which may be due to the strong physical forcing. The physical forcing effects could also explain the attachment of clay minerals to sand grains in both the lake and Nueces Delta because of the relatively weak physical forcing effects, while no clay attachment to sand grains was found at the Copano Bay site because of the strong physical forcing effects. Physical forcing may be an important mechanism in the processing and transport of OM from vascular plants and other organic sources in estuaries and bays before the SOM is exported to coastal oceans.

TI  - Comparison of UV-VIS and FDOM sensors for in situ monitoring of stream DOC concentrations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical measurements using ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometric sensors and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) sensors have recently been used as proxies of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in streams and rivers at a high temporal resolution. Despite the merits of the sensors, temperature changes and particulate matter in water can interfere with the sensor readings, over-or underestimating DOC concentrations. However, little efforts have been made to compare responses of the two types of the sensors to critical interferences such as temperature and turbidity. The performance of a UV-VIS sensor and an FDOM sensor was compared in both laboratory experiments and in situ monitoring in a forest stream in Korea during three storm events. Although the UV-VIS sensor did not require temperature correction in laboratory experiments using the forest stream water, the deviations of its values from the DOC concentrations measured with a TOC analyzer increased linearly as turbidity increased. In contrast, the FDOM sensor outputs decreased significantly as temperature or turbidity increased, requiring temperature and turbidity correction for in situ monitoring of DOC concentrations. The results suggest that temperature correction is relatively straightforward but turbidity correction may not be simple because the attenuation of light by particles can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the sensors in highly turbid waters. Shifts in composition of fluorophores also need to be carefully tracked using periodically collected samples since light absorbance and fluorescence can vary as the concentrations of dominant fluorophores change.

TI  - A comparison of 28 natural and dredged material salt marshes in Texas with an emphasis on geomorphological variables
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Fourteen dredged material marshes and fourteen natural marshes along the Texas, USA, coast are compared on the basis of 1) edge: area ratios, 2) relative exposure index values, 3) elevation profiles, 4) elevation of Spartina alterniflora, 5) soil organic carbon content, 6) soil silt-clay content, and 7) belowground plant biomass. Although edge: area comparisons cannot detect certain types of differences in geomorphology, comparisons clearly show that dredged material marshes, on average, have fewer ponds and flooded depressions than natural marshes. Comparisons of relative exposure index values suggest that wave protection structures associated with some dredged material marshes may be overbuilt. Elevation profiles illustrate the potential for structures such as berms to lead to differences between dredged material marshes and natural marshes, but they also show the high variability in elevation profiles that exists among both dredged material and natural marshes. S. alterniflora elevations in dredged material marshes are not significantly different from those of natural marshes. Soil organic carbon and silt-clay content of dredged material marshes are not significantly different from those of natural marshes. Although belowground biomass of dredged material marshes is significantly lower than that of natural marshes, regression analysis suggests that belowground biomass will increase over time. Findings reported here suggest several points that should be considered during planning and design of dredged material marshes in Texas: 1) if an objective of marsh construction is to mimic natural marsh geomorphology, methods to increase the amount of unconnected edge need to be developed, 2) methods of effectively summarizing geomorphic characteristics need further development, and 3) there is some evidence suggesting that protective structures may be over-built, and the need for substantial structural protection should be balanced against the costs of structures and risk of site failure during project design. Lastly, a method for increasing the amount of unconnected edge that involves excavation of bay bottom before placement of dredged material is suggested.

TI  - Intertidal zone particulate organic carbon redistribution by low-tide rainfall
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present field data and data from the literature to highlight the effects of low-tide rainfall on particulate organic carbon (POC) redistribution in intertidal landscapes. The POC exchanges reported from disparate but related studies were standardized to a storm-induced exchange rate (gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1)) and compared. Results show that these intertidal areas have a characteristic response to rainfall with an average flux of 0.040 +/- 0.038 gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1). Further, low-tide rainfall can entrain and redistribute 7-54% of annual sedimentary POC accumulation, or 12-75% of annual POC export, based on current outwelling assessments. Finally, we provide a conceptual model describing the variability of rainfall-driven POC exchange through the hierarchical structure of intertidal landscapes and how observations of POC flux can be expected to change across the intertidal landscape. This information should be used to guide sampling strategies for continued intertidal zone rainfall work.

AB  - The mycota colonizing the ectorhizosphere-rhizoplane zone of Avicennia marina, Halocnemum Strobilecium, Zygophyllum album, Z. coccineum, Z. simplex, Arthrocnemum macrostachum and Limonastrum monopetalum were investigated along the Red Sea Coast of Egypt. Czapek-Dox basal medium in seawater with different carbon sources (glucose, xylan, starch, cellulose and tannin) in replacement of sucrose, was used as isolation medium. A total of 31 microfungal species belonging to mitosporic fungi (36 spp.), Zygomycota (3 spp.) and Ascomycota (2 spp.) were isolated. The most common species were Cladosporium cladosporoides, Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus terreus var. aureus. Higher counts were observed on xylan, starch and cellulose, lower counts on tannin. The rhizosphere contains both xerotolerant and nontolerant species. Scolecobasidium arenarium was the only recorded arenicolous marine species. Detrended correspondence analysis separates the isolated species into ten communities, each one is specific for a particular plant. Canonical correspondence analysis biplot shows that the patterns of species abundance in the rhizosphere was influenced by changes in organic content, total nitrogen, pH and total dissolved salts ill surrounding soil.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we measured CH4 production potential, methanogen community structure and biogeochemical factors along a coastal wetland transect comprised of five habitat regions: open water, bare tidal flat, invasive S. alterniflora marsh and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis marshes. CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively. S. alterniflora invasion elevated concentration of non-competitive trimethylamine, and shifted methanogen community from acetotrophic to facultative methanogens, which together facilitated increased CH4 production potential.

AB  - This 305-page book, entitled ''Changing Land Use Patterns in the Coastal Zone: Managing Environmental Quality in Rapidly Developing Regions'', is part of the ''Springer Series on Environmental Management'', and this book provides a multidisciplinary guide to the assessment and management of environmental impacts caused by development. This volume contains 11 individually-authored chapters. The first chapter provides an introduction, discussing the effects of changing land use patterns on marine resources and setting a research agenda to facilitate management. The remaining chapters are divided among 3 major parts. Part I of the book considers trends in coastal population growth, and contains chapters 2-4. These 3 chapters individually discuss trends in land use policy and development in the coastal southeast, predicting trajectories of urban growth in the coastal southeast, and urban typology and estuarine biodiversity in rapidly developing coastal watersheds. Coastal hydrology and geochemistry is the focus of part II, which contains chapters 5-8. Topics covered in these 4 chapters include: the relationship of hydrodynamics to morphology in tidal creek and salt marsh systems in South Carolina and Georgia; the role of tidal wetlands in estuarine nutrient cycling; evaluating the potential importance of groundwater-derived carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus inputs to South Carolina and Georgia coastal ecosystems; and oxygen, carbon dioxide, and estuarine condition. Part III of the book focuses on the contaminants and their effects, and contains chapters 9-11, inclusive. These 3 chapters discuss chemical contaminants entering estuaries in the South Atlantic Bight as a result of current and past land use, models of coastal stress, and alternatives to coliform bacteria as indicators of human impact on coastal ecosystems. The final chapter is followed by an afterword on managing coastal urbanization and development in the twenty-first century, and the need for a new paradigm. The afterword is followed by an index. The text is written in English. Each chapter is internally structured into more specific sections within the chapter scope and each chapter is independently referenced. The book is illustrated with numerous illustrations and figures, and includes a list of the contributors and their respective institutions. Functioning both as a practical guide, accessible to nonscientists, and as a rigorous scientific source book, this reference will be useful to ecologists, urban and regional planners, resource managers, policymakers, and students.

AB  - To examine the source and preservation of organic matter in the shelf sediments of the East China Sea (ECS), we measured bulk C/N and isotopes, organic biomarkers (n-alkanes and fatty acids) and compound-specific (fatty acids) stable carbon isotope ratios in three sediment cores collected from two sites near the Changjiang Estuary and one in the ECS shelf. Contrasting chemical and isotopic compositions of organic matter were observed between the estuarine and shelf sediments. The concentrations of total n-alkanes and fatty acids in the shelf surface sediments (0-2 cm) were 5-10 times higher than those in estuarine surface sediments but they all decreased rapidly to comparable levels below the surface layer. The compositions of n-alkanes in the estuarine sediments were dominated by C-26-C-33 long-chain n-alkanes with a strong odd-to-even carbon number predominance. In contrast, the composition of n-alkanes in the shelf sediment was dominated by nC(15) to nC(22) compounds. Long-chain (> C-20) fatty acids (terrestrial biomarkers) accounted for a significantly higher fraction in the estuarine sediments compared to that in the shelf sediment, while short-chain (< C-20) saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the shelf surface sediments than in the estuarine sediments. Stable carbon isotopic ratios of individual fatty acids showed a general positive shift from estuarine to shelf sediments, consistent with the variations in bulk delta(CTOCTOC)-C-13. These contrasts between the estuarine and shelf sediments indicate that terrestrial organic matter was mainly deposited within the Changjiang Estuary and inner shelf of ECS. Post-depositional diagenetic processes in the surface sediments rapidly altered the chemical compositions and control the preservation of organic matter in the region.

TI  - BENTHIC METABOLISM AND SULFATE REDUCTION IN A SOUTHEAST-ASIAN MANGROVE SWAMP
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment metabolism (surface O2 uptake and CO2 production) and S-35-SO4(2-) reduction (0 to 10 cm) were measured during January 1990 (dry season) at 3 stations in the Ao Nam Bor mangrove, Phuket, Thailand. Sulfate reduction as measured by the chromium reduction technique was highest at 6 to 10 cm depth at all stations (600 to 800 nmol S Cm-3 d-1), indicating that significant activity may have occurred below 10 cm. Vertical translocation of metabolizable organic substrates, either due to subsurface root growth or due to downward transport of newly deposited organic matter by bioturbation appeared responsible for the high subsurface activity. The major reduced sulfur compound at all 3 stations was FeS2, both as recovered S-35-label in the sulfate reduction assay (82 to 97 %) and in the total sediment sulfur pool (86 to 100 %). Very low amounts of reduced sulfur were found as HS-, FeS and S-degrees. The general absence of HS- was caused by precipitation reactions controlled by a large sedimentary iron pool. The estimated areal based rates of sulfate reduction (0 to 10 cm, 28 to 50 mmol m-2 d-1) could support around 100 % (65 to 142 %) of the measured CO2 flux across the sediment-water interface. This implies a deficient or non-steady state CO2 flux since the sulfate reduction estimate ignored any activity occurring below 10 cm depth. Possible causes for this deficit may include CO2 assimilation by roots, advective loss of pore water CO2, and excessive CO2 gas loss during air exposure. In general, the mechanisms underlying carbon and sulfur cycling in this mangrove swamp appears remarkably similar to those operating in salt marshes.

AB  - The widespread use of a large range of chemical substances is contributing to the considerable increase in the concentration of trace elements in soils and sediments Furthermore, the accumulation of trace elements in estuarine systems is strongly influenced by the geochemical conditions of the soil, and therefore spatial or temporal changes in these conditions may affect the ability of soils to retain toxic metals The objectives of this study were to establish the geochemical behaviour of trace elements related to Fe and S geochemistry in mangrove soils affected to different degrees and by different types of contamination The study was carried out in 15 soil profiles from different mangrove systems in the State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) Eleven of the mangrove soils were affected by some type of human disturbance, whereas the other four were free from any human interference Redox potential (Eh), pH, total organic carbon content (TOC), total S, total N, and total concentration and partitioning of trace elements were analysed The pH values of the mangrove soils were generally close to neutral, and anoxic conditions predominated Under these geochemical conditions, iron was mainly found in the pyrite fraction, and trace metals were significantly correlated with pyritic-Fe, indicating an important degree of trace metal pyritization However, the degree of pyritization (DTMP) of the trace metals was very different Incorporation of trace elements in the pyritic fraction followed the order Cu, Hg>> Ni> Pb,Zn,Cr The concentration of Zn and Pb in pyritic fraction may have been underestimated since ZnS and PbS are soluble in acid media, and may have been extracted during the steps prior to pyrite extraction We also highlight the need for further studies on the geochemical behavior of Hg and the importance of considering elemental Hg in order to obtain more reliable results

TI  - The role of pyrite in controlling metal ion activities in highly reduced soils
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the solubility relationships of metal sulfides in highly reduced soils. Soils obtained from a mountain bog previously contaminated with Fe, Zn, Cd, and Pb sulfide ores were subjected to oxidation followed by gradual but severe reduction. The sequence of metal sulfide precipitations that occur as pe + pH is lowered was predicted from thermodynamic calculations. These predictions were compared to the results obtained from two studies in which soil suspensions were equilibrated under controlled redox conditions. Oxidation of the surface horizon of these soils resulted in partial dissolution of existing metal sulfides as pH decreased. Subsequent reduction increased pH and formed reaction products that controlled the activities of Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+. When decomposing organic matter was used as the electron source to reduce these soils. the solubility of these metals approached equilibrium with Fe3O4(amorp), ZnCO3(smithsonite), CdCO3(octavite), and PbCO3(cerrusite), respectively, as pH increased above 5.5 and pe + pH decreased to 7.7 at 65 d. The pe + pH did not go lower with organic matter as the sole reductant. A reducing gas mixture containing 1% H-2(g), 5% CO2(g), and 94% Ar was passed through identical soil suspensions to which organic matter had also been added to lower the pe + pH so metal sulfides could precipitate. The calculated pe + pH values at which the metal sulfides formed were: (1) CdS(greenockite) (4.85), (2) ZnS(sphalerite) (4.70), (3) PbS(galena) (4.40), and (4) FeS2(pyrite) (4.35). Since Fe is more abundant in most soils than SO42-, Cd, Zn, and Pb, FeS2(pyrite) is expected to control sulfide activity, and in turn, the activities of Cd2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+. Only under conditions in which there is an abundance of SO42- compared to Fe would the control by pyrite be negated.

TI  - On the application of contemporary bulk sediment organic carbon isotope and geochemical datasets for Holocene sea-level reconstruction in NW Europe
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Bulk organic stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) and element geochemistry (total organic carbon (TOC) and organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N)) analysis is a developing technique in Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) research. The uptake of this technique in Northern Europe is limited compared to North America, where the common existence of coastal marshes with isotopically distinctive C-3 and C-4 vegetation associated with well-defined inundation tolerance permits the reconstruction of RSL in the sediment record. In Northern Europe, the reduced range in delta C-13 values between organic matter sources in C-3 estuaries can make the identification of elevation-dependent environments in the Holocene sediment record challenging and this is compounded by the potential for post-depositional alteration in bulk delta C-13 values. The use of contemporary regional delta C-13, C/N and TOC datasets representing the range of physiographic conditions commonly encountered in coastal wetland sediment sequences opens up the potential of using absolute values of sediment geochemistry to infer depositional environments and associated reference water levels. In this paper, the application of contemporary bulk organic delta C-13, C/N and TOC to reconstruct Holocene RSL is further explored. An extended contemporary regional geochemical dataset of published delta C-13, C/N and TOC observations (n = 142) from tidal-dominated C-3 wetland deposits (representing tidal flat, saltmarsh, reedswamp and fen carr environments) in temperate NW Europe is compiled, and procedures implemented to correct for the C-13 Suess effect on contemporary delta C-13 are detailed. Partitioning around medoids analysis identifies two distinctive geochemical groups in the NW European dataset, with tidal flat/saltmarsh and reedswamp/fen carr environments exhibiting characteristically different sediment delta C-13, C/N and TOC values. A logistic regression model is developed from the NW European dataset in order to objectively identify in the sediment record geochemical groups and, more importantly, group transitions, thus allowing the altitude of reference water levels to be determined. The application of this method in RSL research is demonstrated using the Holocene sediments of the Mersey Estuary (UK), in which delta C-13, C/N and TOC variability is typical of that encountered in Holocene sediments from C-3 coastal wetlands in NW Europe. Group membership was predicted with high probability in the depositional contexts studied and the accuracy of group prediction is verified by microfossil evidence. The method presented facilitates the application of delta C-13, C/N and TOC analysis in RSL reconstruction studies in C-3 vegetated wetlands throughout temperate NW Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The geochemistry of dissolved inorganic carbon in a surficial groundwater aquifer in North Inlet, South Carolina, and the carbon fluxes to the coastal ocean
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - We report measurements of pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total or titration alkalinity (TAlk), Ca2+, Mg2+, sulfate, and sulfide data at the seawater-freshwater interface in a shallow groundwater aquifer in North Inlet, South Carolina. These measurements and a diagenetic modeling analysis indicate that the groundwaters at North Inlet are mixtures of seawater and freshwater end-members and are seriously modified by carbon dioxide inputs from organic carbon degradation via SO4 (2-) reduction across the entire salinity range and fermentation and CaCO3, dissolution in the low-salinity region. DIC and TAlk are several times higher than the theoretical dilution line, whereas Ca2+ is slightly higher and SO42- is somewhat lower than the dilution line. Partial pressure of CO2 in the groundwater is extremely high (0.05 to 0.12 atm). These deviations are consistent with theoretical predictions from known diagenetic reactions. Estimated groundwater DIC fluxes to the South Atlantic Bight from either the surficial aquifer (via salt marshes) or the Upper Floridan Aquifer (direct input) are significant when compared to riverine flux in this area.

TI  - Sedimentary organic-C-13 revealed dispersal patterns of Spartina alterniflora intra- and inter-estuary in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Patterns of long-distance spread of invasive plants via wind and water have been proposed and simulated. Spartina alterniflora can be seen anywhere along the Chinese coastline but its naturally spreading patterns remain unclear. Given the linearity between delta C-13 abundance in sediment and colonizing time of S. alterniflora, a C4 plant, we used organic delta C-13 abundance in surface sediment from the well-developed patches to understand its spread pattern in seven invaded estuaries along the Fujian coastline, including two intentionally introduced estuaries. delta C-13 abundance (%.) in sediments from the seven invaded estuaries were 21.2 +/- 0.8, 20.3 +/- 0.5, 20.7 +/- 1.0, 23.5 +/- 0.4, 22.4 +/- 0.5, 23.2 +/- 0.7, and 22.1 +/- 0.9, respectively, from north to south. Luoyuan and Feiluan estuaries with the intentional plantings had significantly greater delta C-13 abundances than other invaded estuaries. Significant correlations of delta C-13 abundance with electric conductivity (positive) and particle size (negative) (p < 0.01, n=113) in sediments from the seven estuaries indicate the invasion success sequence of S. alterniflora. Taiwan Straits' northward alongshore surface current, switching to southward in winter, might play a crucial role in dispersing seeds of S. alterniflora among estuaries along the Fujian coast. In comparison with the two intentionally planted estuaries, Yacheng estuary showed a clear delta C-13 pattern that declined from seaside to inner estuary. It suggests that a natural invasion at intra-estuary scale with seeds transported by the alongshore surface currents from the two intentional planted estuaries or the upper province. Variations of delta C-13 abundance among the naturally invaded estuaries suggest that other factors might regulate niche availability for S. alterniflora invasion success, such as discharges and sediment topographic features. Moreover, a linear relationship was discovered between delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundances in invaded sediments, suggesting that microbially mediated nitrogen removal processes might prevail and result in N-15 enrichment due to habitat modification by S. alterniflora invasion.

T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - The dataset comprises the field soil organic matter content as a percentage at three depth zones (roughly 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm), measured from bulk density soil samples taken within each 1metre x 1metre quadrat. Prior to measurement of bulk density all soil samples were dried at 105°C for 72 hours. A sub-sample was then taken and dried at 375°C for 16 hours to determine the percentage organic matter of dry soil. Sampling was conducted at six salt marsh sites at four spatial scales: 1 metre (the minimal sampling unit) nested within a hierarchy of increasing scales of 1-10 metres, 10-100 metres and 100-1000 metres. Three of the sites were in Morecambe Bay, North West England and three of the sites were in Essex, South East England. The Morecambe Bay samples were taken during the winter and summer of 2013. The Essex samples were taken during the winter, early spring and summer of 2013. This data was collected as part of Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS): NE/J015644/1. The project was funded with support from the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (BESS) programme. BESS is a six-year programme (2011-2017) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as part of the UK's living with Environmental Change (LWEC) programme. Field soil organic matter was measured from bulk density samples taken at roughly 0-10cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depth zones with a 3.1 cm height, and 7.5 cm diameter bulk density ring for each quadrat. Prior to measurement of bulk density all soil samples were dried at 105°C for 72 hours. A sub-sample was then taken and dried at 375°C for 16 hours to determine the percentage organic matter of dry soil. Results were recorded onto field sheets. These data were transferred into an Excel file and calculations carried out. Results were exported as comma separated value files for ingestion into the EIDC. The location of the sample sites was determined by randomly allocated quadrats. Each site consisted of a rectangular area of saltmarsh between 400 x 500 metres (m) to 1000 x 1000 m in size, dependent upon saltmarsh length (parallel to shore) and width (perpendicular to shore), including part of the low, mid and high marsh zones. Twenty two 1 x 1 m quadrats were randomly allocated to each site rectangle using R (R Development Core Team, 2014) to specify four different spatial scales (A = 1 quadrat only, B = 3 quadrats at 1 m to 10 m apart, C = 6 quadrats at 10 m to 100 m apart, D = 12 quadrats at 100 m to 1000 m or site maximum).

TI  - Below the disappearing marshes of an urban estuary: historic nitrogen trends and soil structure
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, USA are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes (JoCo). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were first installed. Current WWTPs nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable JoCo Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. JoCo Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.

TI  - Threats to mangroves from climate change and adaptation options: A review
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove Vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact oil mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainly over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors oil mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options.

TI  - Interaction of photochemical and microbial processes in the degradation of refractory dissolved organic matter from a coastal marine environment
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between photochemical and biological processes in the degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated with seawater from a coastal southeastern U.S. salt marsh. Seawater supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide (CO) formation in 0.2-mu m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e. with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.

TI  - Linear and nonlinear effects of temperature and precipitation on ecosystem properties in tidal saline wetlands
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - Macroclimatic drivers, such as temperature and rainfall regimes, greatly influence ecosystem structure and function in tidal saline wetlands. Understanding the ecological influence of macroclimatic drivers is important because it provides a foundation for anticipating the effects of climate change. Tidal saline wetlands include mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats, which occupy similar geomorphic settings but different climatic regimes. However, most global- or regional-scale analyses have treated these wetlands as independent systems. Here we used climate and literature-derived ecological data from all three systems, collected across targeted regional-scale macroclimatic gradients, to test hypotheses regarding macroclimatic controls of tidal saline wetland ecosystem properties, specifically canopy height, above-ground biomass, productivity, decomposition, soil carbon density, and soil carbon accumulation. We quantified region-specific climate based ecological thresholds for three data-rich transition zones including eastern North America, eastern Australia, and western Gulf of Mexico. The results of our analyses suggest that small macroclimatic changes might have large ecological implications near climatic thresholds. Our results also demonstrate that relationships between macroclimatic drivers and the ecosystem attributes of tidal saline wetlands are likely to be region-specific. The ecosystem-climate linkages revealed by our analysis should help to characterize important climatic thresholds for ecological regime shifts and could also be used to identify and target for conservation critical transition areas that may be especially sensitive to climate change.

TI  - Great unexpected differences between two populations of the intertidal crab Neohelice granulata inhabiting close but contrasting habitats (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura)
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Two populations of the Southwestern Atlantic burrowing crab, Neohelice granulata (Dana, 1851), are separated by only 190 km. They inhabit bays that drain into a Patagonian gulf in the southernmost limit of the geographical distribution of the species: San Antonio Bay (SAO) and San Jose Gulf (RSJ). The population from SAO has been extensively studied, whereas that of RSJ has not. The main goal of this study is to compare the ecological and habitat characteristics of the two populations, based on samples collected on successive days during the middle of the reproductive season of the crab. The substrate of SAO is composed of a high proportion of gravel and scarce organic matter, whereas the substrate of RSJ presents twice as much silt and clay, and greater organic matter content. Crabs of both sexes were larger at RSJ. Fecundity and reproductive output were greater at RSJ. The size of females at maturity was smaller and their range was shorter at RSJ. Burrows were longer and wider at RSJ. Our results indicate that there are strong differences between the two populations, which might be correlated with local environmental differences, mainly substrate granulometry and food availability.

TI  - Factors controlling net ecosystem metabolism in US estuaries
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - High frequency dissolved oxygen data were analyzed to calculate primary production, respiration and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) from 42 sites within 22 National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR), 1995-2000. NERR sites are characterized by a variety of dominant plant communities including phytoplankton, salt marsh, seagrass, macroalgae, freshwater macrophyte, and mangrove, and are representative of the coastal bioregions of the United States. As expected from the wide diversity of sites, metabolic rates were temporally and spatially variable with the highest production and respiration occurring during the summer in Southeastern estuaries. Sites within different regions exhibited consistent seasonal trends in production, respiration, and NEM. Temperature was the most important environmental factor explaining within-site variation in metabolic rates; nutrient concentrations were the second most important factor. All but three of the 42 sites were heterotrophic (respiration was greater than production) on an annual basis. Habitat adjacent to the monitoring site, estuarine area, and salinity explained 58% of the variation in NEM. Open water sites or sites adjacent to mangroves or in marsh creeks were heterotrophic, while sites in or adjacent to submerged aquatic vegetation (eelgrass or macroalgal beds) were either autotrophic or near balance. Estuarine area was also a significant factor explaining variabitity in NEM; larger systems were closer to balance than smaller systems that trended toward heterotrophy. Freshwater sites were more heterotrophic than saline sites. Nutrient loading explained 68% of the variation in NEM among some of the sites. When these estimates were compared to the literature, metabolic rates from the NERR sites were much larger, often two to five times greater than rates from other estuarine and coastal systems. One explanation is that these small, generally shallow sites located near shore may have greater allochthonous organic inputs as well as significant benthic primary production than the large, deeper systems represented by the literature.

TI  - Nitrogen Fertilization Has a Stronger Effect on Soil Nitrogen-Fixing Bacterial Communities than Elevated Atmospheric CO2
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation is the primary supply of N to most ecosystems, yet there is considerable uncertainty about how N-fixing bacteria will respond to global change factors such as increasing atmospheric CO2 and N deposition. Using the nifH gene as a molecular marker, we studied how the community structure of N-fixing soil bacteria from temperate pine, aspen, and sweet gum stands and a brackish tidal marsh responded to multiyear elevated CO2 conditions. We also examined how N availability, specifically, N fertilization, interacted with elevated CO2 to affect these communities in the temperate pine forest. Based on data from Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR, the soil nifH composition in the three forest systems was dominated by species in the Geobacteraceae and, to a lesser extent, Alphaproteobacteria. The N-fixing-bacterial-community structure was subtly altered after 10 or more years of elevated atmospheric CO2, and the observed shifts differed in each biome. In the pine forest, N fertilization had a stronger effect on nifH community structure than elevated CO2 and suppressed the diversity and abundance of N-fixing bacteria under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. These results indicate that N-fixing bacteria have complex, interacting responses that will be important for understanding ecosystem productivity in a changing climate.

TI  - Derivation of a grain-size proxy to aid the modelling and prediction of radionuclide activity in salt marshes and mud flats of the eastern Irish Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of radionuclide activity, particle size distribution, elemental composition and magnetic properties of saltmarsh and mudflat sediments from the eastern Irish Sea were undertaken in order to identify potential grain-size proxies which could aid long-term modelling of radionuclide activity in this area. Am-241 and Cs-137 concentrations were found to be highly dependent upon the presence of sediment finer than 5 phi, highlighting the need to utilize this fraction in preference to conventional normalization procedures which refer to the abundance of sediment finer than 4 phi. Analyses of potential grain-size proxies for radionuclide activity highlighted a similar grain-size association with respect to sediment magnetic properties. This was linked to the influence of organic carbon on microbial populations responsible for mineral magnetism. Regression analysis was employed to derive a method whereby radionuclide concentration can be predicted using magnetic data as a grain-size proxy, thereby facilitating the identification of spatial and temporal trends in activity data.

TI  - Methane Emission Potential from Freshwater Marsh Soils of Northeast China: Response to Simulated Freezing-Thawing Cycles
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal wetlands are significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and are vulnerable to freezing-thawing cycles (FTC). Nonetheless, the underlying factors that induce CH4 emission in boreal wetlands during FTC are still unclear. Our goal was to characterize soil CH4 emission potential from a freshwater marsh as impacted by FTC and to determine the corresponding mechanisms. We collected soil samples from two soil layers (0-20 and 2040 cm) of an undisturbed freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and subjected them to various freezing (6 to -6 degrees C) and thawing (-6 to 6 degrees C) cycles. Soil CH4 emission, DOC, and the aromaticity and complexity of DOC indexes were monitored. The results showed that FTC significantly increased CH4 emission potential in the 0-20 cm surface soil layer. The maximum hourly CH4 emission rate was 55.0 mg C m(-2) h(-1), approximately 19 times as high as that of the unfrozen control sample (2.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). However, the peak intensity of CH4 emission decreased when the numbers of FTC increased. Meanwhile, FTC not only increased the quantity of DOC released, but also enhanced its instability via increasing the contribution of relatively small, readily degradable organic molecules. Additionally, the CH4 emission potential was significantly correlated with the aromaticity and complexity of DOC, indicating that the release of labile substrates under FTC was one important factor controlling the microbial production of CH4 and the high emissions upon thawing. Our study suggested that global warming-induced increases in seasonal FTC in boreal wetlands may increase CH4 emissions beyond what would occur from long-term temperature increases alone.

TI  - THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF MANGANESE AND IRON REDUCTION IN MARINE-SEDIMENTS
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Manganese and iron reduction in marine sediments are known to play important roles in the biogeochemical cycles of many elements, including carbon, sulfur, phosphorus and several trace elements. These reduction reactions affect these cycles on a variety of time scales, ranging from those as short as seasonal time scales (e.g., nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems), to those as long as thousands to tens of thousands of years (e.g., glacial-interglacial transformations in deep sea sediments). In this review article I will briefly summarize the results of laboratory studies on the types of manganese and iron reduction that are known to occur in marine sediments, and then discuss the occurrence of these processes in different sedimentary environments. Particular efforts will be given to examining the rates and mechanisms of sedimentary manganese and iron reduction in relationship to other biogeochemical processes in sediments.

AB  - A sequential technique for extraction of metals from sediments (modified Tessier method) - was used to determine the distribution of the metals Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the major sedimentary phases (available, reducible, oxidisable, and residual) in marine sediment samples from six Red Sea Islands. The total metal content was also determined. The oxidizable fraction showed strong association of the metals with organic matter and sulfides. Overall, the total trace metal concentrations in the sediment samples were lower than in previous studies, except for Cd, Pb, and Zn, caused by increasing human activities and landfilling operations on the Red Sea coast. Descriptive data analysis was performed by using statistical method.

AB  - In this chapter, the significance of meiobenthic fauna as consumers in benthic systems is elucidated in a number of coastal locations (down to 200 m) representing a range of environmental and ecological conditions in different coastal zones and biogeographical regions. Food preferences, feeding strategies, and diet spectra are also reviewed across various feeding guilds and taxonomic groups. In addition, by condensing estimates of meiofaunal trophic interactions with other benthic components, a quantitative role of meiobenthos in carbon transfer and energy flows from organic matter sources to higher consumers in food web is assessed.

TI  - Harnessing microbially generated power on the seafloor
T2  - NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In many marine environments, a voltage gradient exists across the water-sediment interface resulting from sedimentary microbial activity. Here we show that a fuel cell consisting of an anode embedded in marine sediment and a cathode in overlying seawater can use this voltage gradient to generate electrical power in situ. Fuel cells of this design generated sustained power in a boat basin carved into a salt marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey, and in the Yaquina Bay Estuary near Newport, Oregon. Retrieval and analysis of the Tuckerton fuel cell indicates that power generation results from at least two anode reactions: oxidation of sediment sulfide (a by-product of microbial oxidation of sedimentary organic carbon) and oxidation of sedimentary organic carbon catalyzed by microorganisms colonizing the anode. These results demonstrate in real marine environments a new form of power generation that uses an immense, renewable energy reservoir (sedimentary organic carbon) and has near-immediate application.

TI  - The importance of seagrass beds as a habitat for fishery species
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 39
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass beds are thought to have a fundamental role in maintaining populations of commercially exploited fish and invertebrate species by providing one or more of the following: (a) a permanent habitat, allowing completion of the full life cycle, (b) a temporary nursery area for the successful development of the juvenile stages, (c) a feeding area for various life-history stages and (d) a refuge from predation. In addition to these primary roles, seagrass beds are thought to maintain fisheries indirectly by providing organic matter that is incorporated into coastal nutrient cycles and which supports secondary production, including fisheries species. Unfortunately, these roles have been distilled from a disparate literature that often reports results using different sampling methods, seagrass species, geographical locations and temporal or spatial scales.The aims of this review are to summarise the literature assessing the importance of seagrass habitats for fishery species, to highlight possible confounding factors that may help to explain some of the contradictory statements in the literature and to identify areas of seagrass ecology that require further investigation.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to examine the vegetative, sedimentary, nekton and hydrologic response to ecological re-engineering of a freshwater Impoundment in the Upper Bay of Fundy The dyke was breached in five locations and one channel initiated to connect the river to the borrow pit behind the dyke This triggered significant self-organization within the restoration site Existing channels (e g borrow pit) were incorporated within the newly excavated and developing creek system, increasing the hydraulic connectivity within the marsh and increasing fish habitat Vegetation colonization, primarily by Spartina alterniflora, was rapid with almost 100% coverage by the end of the third year Species associated with high marsh communities such as Juncus gerardu. Scirpus robustus. Ranunculus cymbalaria and Puccinellia maritima were present in increasing abundance post-restoration at the restoration site The constructed channel eroded downward 2 3 m and the head of the channel retreated 35 m in response to the increased tidal prism. In the year immediately following the breach (2006), the surface of the marsh was unconsolidated and rates of change in sur face elevation measured at RSET stations ranged from -0 7 (+/- 0.1) to 1 7 (+/- 0 2)cm yr(-1) (+/- ISE) Measurements between years are highly variable By year 3 the rate of surface elevation change decreased to a more moderate but variable mean of 0 3 (+/- 0 6) cm yr(-1) with the marker horizons recording mean accretion rates of 0 7 cm yr(-1). This implies subsurface consolidation as the sediments dewatered or organic matter decomposed and vegetation became more established Fish density decreased after restoration, however, remained higher than at the reference site for most years (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - This data set includes measurements of water samples collected from 7 sites during 16 surveys carried out between March 2016 and March 2018 in the salt marshes of Donana National Park. Geographic coordinates of sampling positions are provided. During samplings, in situ water conductivity (converted to salinity), temperature and pH were measured using a multi‐probe (YSI‐6920V2, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) and water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of dissolved methane and nitrous oxide by static‐head space equilibration gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for CH4, according to de la Paz et al.

TI  - Quantification of sawgrass marsh aboveground biomass in the coastal Everglades using object-based ensemble analysis and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale biomass quantification of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) marsh is critical to understand the carbon and energy cycle in the Florida Everglades. There is also a need to monitor biomass changes in the coastal Everglades due to continuing sea level rise. Previous research in biomass estimation of coastal marshes has focused on pixel-based parametric modeling methods. In this study, an object-based ensemble analysis approach was developed to map sawgrass biomass at multiple scales using Landsat data. Four machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were evaluated and compared to the commonly used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for both live and total sawgrass biomass estimation. A weighted combining scheme was developed to integrate predictions from comparable models for ensemble analysis. Nonparametric machine learning models had better performance than the parametric approach. ANN and SVM produced similar results in live biomass estimation with the correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.9, while ANN achieved the best result for the total biomass estimation (r = 0.94). Sawgrass biomass maps were produced for two harvest seasons in 2014 and 2016 at three detail levels, which successfully revealed the spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) sawgrass biomass variations. Ensemble analysis of the ANN and SVM predictions of live sawgrass biomass not only made the estimation more reliable, but also generated an uncertainty map to identify the regions with a robust biomass prediction, as well as challenging areas for biomass quantification. It is concluded that the object-based ensemble analysis is a promising alternative to the commonly used pixel-based biomass modeling techniques.

TI  - Biochar-amended coastal wetland soil enhances growth of Suaeda salsa and alters rhizosphere soil nutrients and microbial communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar has the potential to improve soil properties and increase plant productivity. However, due to the different types of soil, plants, and environmental factors, the impact of biochar is likely to vary. We explored the impacts of biochar prepared from an invasive plant Spartina alterniflora on plant performance and soil characteristics in a simulated coastal wetland ecosystem. We investigated the impact of three application ratios (control, 1%, and 5%; weight ratio) of biochar on the germination and growth of a native plant Suaeda salsa, the nutrient content and microbial community characteristics of the rhizosphere soil under three flooding treatments (no flooding, episodic flooding, and continuous flooding). Biochar application had no impact on seed germination of S. salsa, but promoted its seedling growth (biomass, height, root length) and nitrogen content. Biochar application also enhanced soil nutrient content and affected soil microbial community characteristics. Seed germination and seedling growth of S. salsa were sensitive to flooding and were the best under episodic flooding. Notably, flooding inhibited the impact of biochar on S. salsa and rhizosphere soil. In conclusion, biochar can positively affect the growth of S. salsa and improve the quality of rhizosphere soil, especially under no flooding. Our findings highlight the possibility of applying biochar for the restoration of S. salsa in coastal wetlands. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - SULFUR ENRICHMENT OF HUMIC SUBSTANCES IN A DELAWARE SALT-MARSH SEDIMENT CORE
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Humic sulfur, operationally defined as the sulfur extracted with humic substances in 0.1 N NaOH solution, comprises up to 51% of the total sulfur inventory in a sediment core taken from a Delaware Spartina alterniflora marsh.  Pyrite sulfur is the next largest fraction, except at the near-surface sediments, where zerovalent sulfur concentrations are significant.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the humic sulfur consists of sulfoxides or sulfones and, in a more reduced state, organic sulfides and/or organic polysulfides.  A subsurface decreases in the humic acid C:S atomic ratio to 56 +/- 2 suggests that the upper 4 cm of marsh sediment is the locus for humic sulfur formation.  S. alterniflora detritus and microbial biomass cannot fully account for observed sulfur enrichment of humic C:S atomic ratios.  Therefore, the enrichment of humic substances by sulfur is probably via reaction of reduced sulfur compounds with organic matter.  A humic sulfur formation rate of 10.6-mu-mol S.cm-3.a-1 is calculated for the surface sediments and leads to an areal production of 18-mu-mol S.cm-2.a-1 of humic sulfur.  Humic sulfur formation and preservation is enhanced by the limited availability of iron for the rapid precipitation of iron sulfide minerals and the apparent resistance of organic sulfur compounds towards reoxidation to sulfate, especially in the upper 9 cm of marsh sediment where inorganic sulfur compounds are rapidly oxidized.

TI  - Iron Reduction Along an Inundation Gradient in a Tidal Sedge (Cyperus malaccensis) Marsh: the Rates, Pathways, and Contributions to Anaerobic Organic Matter Mineralization
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Incubation experiments were adopted to characterize the rates and pathways of iron reduction and the contributions to anaerobic organic matter mineralization in the upper 0-5 cm of sediments along a landscape-scale inundation gradient in tidal marsh sediments in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China. Similar sediment characteristics, single-species vegetation, varied biomass and bioturbation, distinct porewater pH, redox potential, and electrical conductivity values have resulted in a unique ecogeochemical zonation along the inundation gradient. Decreases in solid-phase Fe(III) and increases in nonsulfidic Fe(II) and iron sulfide were observed in a seaward direction. Porewater Fe2+ was only detected in the upland area. High rates of iron reduction were observed in incubation jars, with significant accumulations of nonsulfidic Fe(II), moderate accumulations of iron sulfides, and negligible accumulations of porewater Fe2+. Most of the iron reduction was microbially mediated rather than coupled to reduced sulfides. Microbial iron reduction accounted for 20-89 % of the anaerobic organic matter mineralization along the inundation gradient. The rate and dominance of microbial iron reduction generally decreased in a seaward direction. The contributions of microbial iron reduction to anaerobic organic matter mineralization depended on the concentrations of bioavailable Fe(III), the spatial distribution of which was significantly related to tidal inundation. Our results clearly showed that microbial iron reduction in the upper sediments along the gradient is highly dependent on spatial scales controlled primarily by tidal inundation.

TI  - Tea Bag Index S and k data of tidal wetland sites
T2  - PANGAEA
M3  - Data set
AB  - Tidal wetlands, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, are hotspots for carbon sequestration. The preservation of organic matter (OM) is a critical process by which tidal wetlands exert influence over the global carbon cycle and at the same time gain elevation to keep pace with sea-level rise (SLR). The present study provides the first global-scale field-based experimental evidence of temperature and relative sea level effects on the decomposition rate and stabilization of OM in tidal wetlands. The study was conducted in 26 marsh and mangrove sites across four continents, utilizing commercially available standardized OM. While effects on decomposition rate per se were minor, we show unanticipated and combined negative effects of temperature and relative sea level on OM stabilization. Across study sites, OM stabilization was 29% lower in low, more frequently flooded vs. high, less frequently flooded zones. OM stabilization declined by ~90% over the studied temperature gradient from 10.9 to 28.5°C, corresponding to a decline of ~5% over a 1°C temperature increase. Additionally, data from the long-term ecological research site in Massachusetts, US show a pronounced reduction in OM stabilization by >70% in response to simulated coastal eutrophication, confirming the high sensitivity of OM stabilization to global change. We therefore provide evidence that rising temperature, accelerated SLR, and coastal eutrophication may decrease the future capacity of tidal wetlands to sequester carbon by affecting the initial transformations of recent OM inputs to soil organic matter.

TI  - Collection, analysis, and age-dating of sediment cores from Herring River wetlands and other nearby wetlands in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, 2015-17
T2  - United States Geological Survey
M3  - Data set
AB  - The Herring River estuary in Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has been tidally restricted for more than a century by a dike constructed near the mouth of the river. Upstream from the dike, the tidal restriction has caused the conversion of salt marsh wetlands to various other ecosystems including impounded freshwater marshes, flooded shrub land, drained forested upland, and brackish wetlands dominated by Phragmites australis. This estuary is now managed by the National Park Service, which plans to replace the aging dike and restore tidal flow to the estuary. To assist National Park Service land managers with restoration planning, the U.S. Geological Survey collected fourteen sediment cores from different ecosystems within the tidally restricted Herring River estuary (four sites) and an estuary in Wellfleet Harbor near the Herring River dike (three sites) between 2015 and 2017. Collected cores were up to 70 cm in length with dry bulk density ranges from 0.03 to 2.39 grams per cubic centimeter and carbon content 0.23% to 46.25%. Land surface elevation was measured at each site (ranging from -0.149 meters to 1.494 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the boundaries for each site within current tidal conditions. Gamma counting results for excess lead-210 were used to construct Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) age models to age-date individual depth intervals in the cores. Additionally, gamma counting results for other radionuclides, particularly cesium-137 gave further insight to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. This dataset can help evaluate differences among the varied ecosystems and vegetation types to make predictions about potential changes as tidal restoration commences in the Herring River estuary.

TI  - Utilization effects and environmental risks of phosphogypsum in agriculture: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - In the previous half century, it has presented a broad interest in promoting the multipurpose application of waste phosphogypsum (PG). Owing to its effects in the improvement of soil properties, PG has been widely utilized in agriculture field as an amendment. Although the application of PG in agriculture can make a good economic profit, the relevant research is very inadequate compared to the application in other fields. An integrated review of a large amount of research on agriculture utilization of PG as a soil improver was carried out in this study, including the PG properties, application scopes, improvement effects, and environmental risks. Waste PG presents a plenty of effects in agriculture utilization as a soil amendment, e.g., improving soil physicochemical properties, reducing heavy metal leaching, lessening soil loss, supplying beneficial trace elements, and promoting crop growth. However, waste PG contains high contents of salts, heavy metals, and some natural radionuclides. Therefore, some key aspects regarding PG application in agriculture should be concerned, e.g., the long-range effects of PG on the soil quality, heavy metal accumulation, radiological impact, plant development and crop quality. Moreover, the amelioration effects of mixing PG with other various amendments should be discussed to advance the agriculture utilization of PG. The issues of salt concentration, heavy metal toxicity, and radiological impact due to extra addition also need to be resolved when waste PG is utilized in agricultural field. Due to the limitation of environmental risks, the utilization conditions of PG in agriculture should be determined. In addition, some standards and regulations for the practical utilization of PG should be put forward to effectively guide the application of PG in agriculture. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sources and distribution of organic matter in a river-dominated estuary (Winyah Bay, SC, USA)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sources and distribution of organic matter (OM) in surface waters and sediments from Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) were investigated using a variety of analytical techniques, including elemental, stable isotope and organic biomarker analyses. Several locations along the estuary salinity gradient were sampled during four different periods of contrasting river discharge and tidal ranee. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters ranged from 7 mg l(-1) in the lower bay stations closest to the ocean to 20 mg l(-1) in the river and upper bay samples. There was a general linear relationship between DOC concentrations and salinity in three of the four sampling periods. In contrast, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were significantly lower (0.1-3 mg l(-1)) and showed no relationship with salinity. The high molecular weight dissolved OM (HMW DOM) isolated from selected water samples collected along the bay displayed atomic carbon: nitrogen ratios ([C/N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic carbon (delta(13)C(OC)) that ranged from 10 to 30 and from -28 to -25parts per thousand, respectively. Combined, such compositions indicate that in most HMW DOM samples, the majority of the OM originates from terrigenous sources, with smaller contributions from riverine and estuarine phytoplankton. In contrast, the [C/N]a ratios of particulate OM (POM) samples varied significantly among the collection periods, ranging from low values of similar to5 to high values of >20. Overall, the trends in [C/N]a ratios indicated that algal sources of POM were most important during the early and late summer, whereas terrigenous sources dominated in the winter and early spring.In Winyah Bay bottom sediments, the concentrations of the mineral-associated OM were positively correlated with sediment surface area. The [C/N]a ratios and delta(13)C(OC) compositions of the bulk sedimentary OM ranged from 5 to 45 and from -28 to -23parts per thousand, respectively. These compositions were consistent with predominant contributions of terrigenous sources and lesser (but significant) inputs of freshwater, estuarine and marine phytoplankton. The highest terrigenous contents were found in sediments from the river and upper bay sites, with smaller contributions to the lower parts of the estuary. The yields of lignin-derived CuO oxidation products from Winyah Bay sediments indicated that the terrigenous OM in these samples was composed of variable mixtures of relatively fresh vascular plant detritus and moderately altered soil OM. Based on the lignin phenol compositions, most of this material appeared to be derived from angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular plant sources similar to those found in the upland coastal forests in this region. A few samples displayed lignin compositions that suggested a more significant contribution from marsh C-3 grasses. However, there was no evidence of inputs of Spartina alterniflora (a C-4 grass) remains from the salt marshes that surround the lower sections of Winyah Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - On the ecogeomorphological feedbacks that control tidal channel network evolution in a sandy mangrove setting
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecomorphodynamic model was developed to study how Avicennia marina mangroves influence channel network evolution in sandy tidal embayments. The model accounts for the effects of mangrove trees on tidal flow patterns and sediment dynamics. Mangrove growth is in turn controlled by hydrodynamic conditions. The presence of mangroves was found to enhance the initiation and branching of tidal channels, partly because the extra flow resistance in mangrove forests favours flow concentration, and thus sediment erosion in between vegetated areas. The enhanced branching of channels is also the result of a vegetation-induced increase in erosion threshold. On the other hand, this reduction in bed erodibility, together with the soil expansion driven by organic matter production, reduces the landward expansion of channels. The ongoing accretion in mangrove forests ultimately drives a reduction in tidal prism and an overall retreat of the channel network. During sea-level rise, mangroves can potentially enhance the ability of the soil surface to maintain an elevation within the upper portion of the intertidal zone, while hindering both the branching and headward erosion of the landward expanding channels. The modelling results presented here indicate the critical control exerted by ecogeomorphological interactions in driving landscape evolution.

TI  - Ecosystem Respiration Does not Differ Before and After Tidal Inundation in Brackish Marshes of the Min River Estuary, Southeast China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiration in tidal marshes plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, but is little investigated in Asia. In this study, ecosystem respiration in three brackish marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass), Phragmites australis (common reed) and Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass) were examined monthly during 2009 in the subtropical tidal wetland of the Min River estuary of southeast China. Measurements were taken before and after tidal inundation. Soil porewater CO2 concentrations at soil depths of 5 and 10 cm were also measured. Differences in ecosystem respiration before and after tidal inundation stages were statistically indistinguishable in each vegetation type on an annual scale but differed by month. Monthly variation in ecosystem respiration was apparent and overall respiration in P. australis stand had the highest respiration of the vegetation types. Monthly average CO2 concentration in soil porewater did not differ significantly between the two depths. Ecosystem respiration in P. australis and C. malaccensis stands had a significant positive correlation with soil and air temperature, and a significant negative correlation with soil pH in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis stands. Our results suggested that the brackish marsh ecosystem of subtropical estuary emits CO2 to the atmosphere at relatively higher level, but the emission pattern did not differ before and after tides.

TI  - Iberian Halophytes as Agroecological Solutions for Degraded Lands and Biosaline Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Research on biosaline agriculture has been increasing worldwide in recent years. In this respect, the Iberian halophyte diversity present a high-value ecological solution to be implemented for biosaline-based agroecosystems. The research on these halophytic species has been increasing worldwide and, in the recent years, especially in terms saline agriculture adaptation, osmophysiology and nutraceutical potential, highlighting the importance and potential of these species in terms of agrosolutions. The Mediterranean area has high biodiversity in terms of endemic halophytic vegetation (ca. 62 species), providing an alternative pool of potential new agricultural products to be cultivated in adverse conditions. Besides being highly diverse, most of these species are endemic and present a perennial life cycle with several applications in terms of food, forage, nutraceutical, feedstock and remediation. More specifically, the Iberian halophytic flora shows potential as resources of essential fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants-all very important for human and animal nutrition. Alongside the establishment of halophyte agroecological solutions is the provision of key ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and soil rehabilitation. Moreover, halophyte-based ecosystems provide additional recognized ecosystem services, beyond the final product production, by improving soil health, ecosystem biodiversity and storing large amounts of carbon, thereby increasing the ecosystem resilience to climate change and offering a green solution against climate change.

TI  - Considering "Coastal Carbon" in Existing US Federal Statutes and Policies
T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses provide important ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish, shoreline protection, and the recently recognized service of carbon sequestration and storage. When these wetland ecosystems are degraded or destroyed, the carbon can be released to the atmosphere, where it adds to the concentration of greenhouses gases (GHGs) that contribute to climate change. Many federal statutes and policies specifically require that impacts on ecosystem services be considered in policy implementation. Yet, no federal statute, regulation, or policy accounts directly for the carbon held in coastal habitats. There are a number of federal statutes and policies for which coastal carbon ecosystem services could reasonably be added to environmental and ecosystem considerations already implemented. We look at a subset of these statutes and policies to illustrate how coastal carbon ecosystem services and values might affect the implementation and outcomes of such statutes generally. We identify key steps for the inclusion of the ecosystem services of coastal habitats into the implementation of existing federal policies without statutory changes; doing so would increase the degree to which these policies consider the full economic and ecological impacts of policy actions.

TI  - Increase of organic matter transport between marshes and tidal flats by the burrowing crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata Dana in SW Atlantic salt marshes
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marshes are considered exporters of organic material, with tides being one of the most studied transport mechanisms. However, animal movements can enhance this energy transport and even, in some cases, import energy to marshes by fecal deposition. In this work, we analyze if Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata, an abundant intertidal burrowing crab that changes its diet between marsh (herbivorous) and tidal flat (deposit feeder) zones and moves between zones during the tidal cycle, enhance energy transfer between marshes and tidal flats by fecal deposition. Given that higher tidal levels increase these movements, two intertidal habitats with different tidal amplitudes were compared (Mar Chiquita Coastal lagoon 37 degrees 40' S -MCCL, max 2 m and San Antonio Bay 40 degrees 46' S -SAB, max 9 m). The seasonal and tidal movements between zones were studied using movement traps. Crabs moving towards each direction were kept in containers to calculate fecal production and the total organic matter (OM) release and OM% of their feces. With these data, a resampling technique was performed to compare with a 3 way ANOVA the net transport of feces seasonally, between zones, in both intertidals. The results showed that the movement of N. granulata enhances the exchange of OM among habitats by fecal deposition between marsh and tidal flats with seasonal variations in its importance. Fecal transport showed differences between locations being 10 times higher in winter and decreasing towards summer in MCCL, while the opposite trend was found in SAB. There were no differences in the OM deposited in each zone in SAB but in MCCL there was 45% more feces deposited in the marsh than in the tidal flat. The fecal OM% is higher in SAB than in MCCL suggesting that biodeposition in SAB, where it can reach 40%OM (surrounding sediment is lower than 2%) could be more important. The fecal production in MCCL is about 80% of the rate of detritus production in the marsh. In conclusion, fecal deposition is a very important input of energy in marsh zones, being crabs an important mechanism in transporting OM mainly towards the marsh zones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tidal and Nontidal Marsh Restoration: A Trade-Off Between Carbon Sequestration, Methane Emissions, and Soil Accretion
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with Pb-210-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 +/- 90 and -350 +/- 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) that accounted for similar to 13%-23% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a > 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 +/- 2.0 to 8 +/- 4 decades.

TI  - Effects of tillage on phosphorus release potential in a Spanish vertisol
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till (NT) practices usually increase the P content in soil surfaces. The main purpose of this work was to study the long-term effects of the soil tillage system on the P release potential in the surface layer of a Vertisol from southwest Spain and to correlate it with changes in P content and forms. The three tillage treatments investigated were: (i) conventional tillage (CT) with a moldboard plow and field cultivator; (ii) minimum tillage (MT) with a field cultivator; and (iii) NT, which involved direct sowing into crop residue from the previous year. After 21 yr, NT resulted in enhanced organic matter, Olsen P, organic P, and total P contents relative to CT and MT in the top 5 cm of soil. The ratio of labile inorganic P fractions to P related to sparingly soluble pedogenic Ca phosphates in the surface soil layer was much greater under NT (0.8) than under CT (0.57) or MT (0.55). This was ascribed to a decreased precipitation of sparingly soluble Ca phosphate because of the enrichment in organic matter under NT, and accounted in part for the higher portion of inorganic P related to labile fractions in NT (0.19 vs. 0.09 in CT and 0.10 in MT). The increased P release potential of surface soil as estimated by using P sinks indicated that an increased dissolved P concentration in runoff and a greater amount of potentially releasable P per unit mass of surface soil lost through erosive processes can be expected with NT than with MT or CT.

TI  - DIAGENESIS OF BELOWGROUND BIOMASS OF SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA IN SALT-MARSH SEDIMENTS
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Belowground biomass of Spartina alterniflora lost 55% of its organic matter during 18 months of decomposition in salt-marsh sediments. Significant losses of lignin were observed under highly reducing conditions confirming previous reports of lignin degradation in the absence of molecular oxygen. The submolecular components of lignin varied in susceptibility to degradation and were ranked in the following descending order of resistance to decomposition: V is similar to P > S is similar to C. The preferential degradation of the cinnamyl and syringyl components constrains the quantitative usefulness of these compounds for estimating the contributions of herbaceous and angiosperm tissues to pools of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The relative concentration of lignin increased about 1.6-fold during decomposition owing to the more rapid loss of polysaccharides.Two phases in nitrogen dynamics were evident during the decomposition study. During the first 4 months of decomposition there was a net loss of N from Spartina tissues at a rate of about 10-mu-g N g-1 tissue d-1. After this initial phase of net N loss, a phase of N immobilization was evident and was tightly coupled with rates of microbial degradation of the tissues. Net rates of N immobilization were approximately 19-mu-g N g-1 tissue d-1; by the end of the 18-month study more N had accumulated in the tissues than was initially present. Stable N isotope compositions of decaying Spartina were also very dynamic and reflected the sources of N that were immobilized during decomposition and the N transformations that occurred on the detrital particles.The stable C isotope composition of the polysaccharide components of Spartina was approximately 6 parts per thousand heavier than that of the lignin component. The isotopic compositions of these components retained the 6 parts-per-thousand difference throughout the 18-month study. The stable C isotope composition of the bulk tissues, however, decreased gradually during decomposition as the isotopically heavier polysaccharides were preferentially lost. Residual material was relatively enriched in the isotopically lighter, lignin-derived C.

TI  - Multi-decadal trends and influences on dissolved organic carbon distribution in the Barataria Basin, Louisiana from in-situ and Landsat/MODIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Barataria Basin, a deltaic marsh-estuary system in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the coastal ecosystem. To assess DOM dynamics, monthly measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and colored DOM (CDOM; an optical proxy for DOC) absorption were obtained over a three-year period (2008-2011) along a transect encompassing the upper, middle and lower regions of the Barataria Basin estuary. While CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) generally decreased and spectral slope at 275-295 nm (S275-295) increased along the transect from the upper to lower basin, deviations were observed associated with hydrologic and meteorological influences. An application of wavelet analysis to the time-series of a(g)355 and various freshwater sources revealed a spatiotemporal resonance of ag355 with freshwater input from the Mississippi River (MR), the controlled freshwater discharge from the Davis Pond freshwater diversion, and rainfall in the lower, middle and upper basins, respectively. Field measurements and Landsat/MODIS data spanning across different seasons between 2008 and 2011 were used to develop optimized a(g)355 empirical algorithms for the high river flow, cold front, and normal conditions. Power law models relating a band ratio (green/red) of a satellite sensor to a(g)355 showed good performance for the MODIS-Aqua (R-2 similar to 0.81-0.83, N = 581) and Landsat-5 TM (R-2 similar to 0.72-0.79, N = 304) imagery. a(g)355-DOC relationships (R-2 similar to 0.77-0.84, N = 306) applied to historical Landsat-5 TM (1985-2011) and MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2012) showed strong environmental influences on multi-decadal CDOM and DOC spatiotemporal trends. Satellite-derived DOC agreed reasonably well with in-situ measured DOC (averaged R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.13). While the time-series DOC showed seasonality and decreasing gradients from the upper to lower basin, an overall increase in DOC was observed in the upper and middle basins from 1985 to 2012. However, in the lower basin, DOC increased from 1985 to 2006 but decreased from 2007 to 2012, likely due to the impact of two major hurricanes in 2005. Furthermore, relationships between satellite-derived DOC and land cover variations (1985-2011) along the wetland-estuary interfaces derived from Landsat-5 TM supervised classification showed an increase in DOC with corresponding increase in developed area in the upper basin, while in the lower basin, DOC increased by 41% (R-2 = 0.54) between 1985 and 2006 corresponding to a 17% decrease in salt marsh area, suggesting strong land use/land loss impact on the long-term DOC trends in Barataria Basin.

TI  - SULFUR SPECIATION AND PYRITE FORMATION IN MEROMICTIC EX-FJORDS
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Powell and Sakinaw Lakes are stably stratified ex-fjords, which became isolated from the Strait of Georgia approximately 11000 years ago by emerged sills due to post-glacial isostatic rebound. Both lakes contain highly sulphidic relict seawater (Powell 3.0 mM; Sakinaw 5.5 mM) at depth chemically analogous to porewaters of reducing marine sediments. Sakinaw has a very sharp chemocline located just below the oxic/anoxic interface, whereas in Powell, the interface is spread out over 200 m of the water column. Sulphate is present in the oxic part of the water column at much higher concentrations in Sakinaw Lake (up to 65 muM) than in Powell Lake (10 muM), and increases in concentration with depth until reaching the interface, below which it is rapidly depleted. Sulphur oxyanions of intermediate oxidation state (thiosulphate, sulphite, and tetrathionate) are not detectable in either lake. Particulate elemental sulphur was also not found in either lake. High concentrations of reduced iron and hydrogen sulphide result in formation of iron monosulphides and pyrite in the anoxic water columns of both lakes. The presence of these two minerals correlates well with their calculated saturation states. Pyrite precipitates with no apparent monosulphide precursor at depths where dissolved sulphide concentrations are low and monosulphide phases are undersaturated. As sulphide levels increase at greater depths, the waters become saturated with respect to iron monosulphides and particulate FeS species are detected in the water column. The large separation of the oxic/anoxic interface and the chemocline in Sakinaw (approximately 10 m) and especially in Powell Lake (approximately 100 m) relative to that of sediment porewaters allows excellent resolution of these processes.

TI  - Studies of a contaminated brackish marsh in the Hackensack Meadowlands of Northeastern New Jersey: benthic communities and metal contamination
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Cores taken from 16 stations within Eight Day Swamp, a highly contaminated marsh in the Hackensack Meadowlands, were analyzed for metal concentrations and for benthic community structure. Metal levels were compared with the benchmark ERM values, and expressed in terms of toxic units. Mercury was the most important metal in all the samples in terms of its contribution to the total toxic units. The overall abundance and taxa richness in the benthic community were associated with the height of the location relative to the tidal cycle, but were generally not significantly correlated with metal concentrations at the sites. Ordination of the communities showed that the communities that were low-lying (on the mudflat) were most similar to one another, and those that were higher up on the marsh were most similar to one another. However, diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener H' and Simpson's) were significantly associated with concentrations of the metals (except As) and with the sum of the toxic units at a station.

TI  - THE USE OF STABLE ISOTOPES IN STUDIES OF NUTRIENT CYCLING - CARBON ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF AMAZON VARZEA SEDIMENTS
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to characterize the organic and isotopic compositions and the origin of the sediment deposited in the Amazon river floodplain, samples from lake bottom, grass cover, and vegetation free sediments were studied. The results obtained showed that after deposition the organic characteristics of these sediments were altered according to their environment. Thus, compared to river-transported fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), samples from the lake bottom sediments showed increases in carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and decreases in delta-C-13 values due to the low isotopic composition of the particulate organic carbon in the lakes. Samples from areas covered by grasses had lower nitrogen and carbon relative to FPOM. The isotopic composition was changed by organic matter produced by the grasses, becoming less negative in delta-C-13 in the downriver direction. In the vegetation-free samples, collected over areas that had been recently drained, the isotopic composition did not change in relation to FPOM, but a decrease in carbon and nitrogen was observed.

TI  - Nitrogen isotope ratios in estuarine biota collected along a nutrient gradient in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable nitrogen isotope ratios were used to study the incorporation of anthropogenically-derived nitrogen into the food webs of salt marsh systems along a contamination gradient in Narragansett Bay. Nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) were measured in six estuarine species collected from three marshes along this gradient, monthly from June to October between 1997 and 1999. A significant decrease in delta N-15 was found with distance along the estuary for four of the six species.Significant differences were found among monthly isotope ratios for some species. Nitrogen isotope ratios in sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) increased during the summer season with highest delta N-15 values measured during September and October. This trend was most pronounced at the station receiving the highest nutrient inputs. Elevated delta N-15 values at this station appeared to correlate with seawater ammonia/nitrate concentration ratios. The temporal variations in delta N-15 suggest that care should be taken in species selection and the design of sampling schemes of studies using delta N-15 for monitoring anthropogenic nutrients in aquatic systems. Sampling programs designed to determine long-term trends should consider species that do not show rapid fluctuations in isotope ratios. The mud snail, Nassarius obsoletus, responded this way in the present study. Studies designed to measure short-term changes should include species such as U. lactuca, which rapidly respond to isotope changes. The results from this study also help to establish a baseline for nitrogen isotope values in Narragansett Bay. This information can be used to monitor future trends in nitrogen inputs to this estuary. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Using food quality and retention time to predict digestion efficiency in geese
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations of food digestibility are important in nutritional studies of herbivores, but accurate assessments in the field are usually difficult and time consuming. This study explored the possibility of predicting digestibility and metabolisability of organic matter from the chemical composition and retention time of food in barnacle geese Branta leucopsis. Captive birds were used in indoor trials to allow accurate assessments of digestion in terms of energy, organic matter and nutritional components. Retention times were estimated from dropping rates which were recorded by an electronic device. The regression models that best explained the variation in apparent digestibility and metabolisability of organic matter incorporated the proportion of cell walls in the food (acid detergent fibre had a negative effect) and the retention time (longer retention had a positive effect). To test the predictive power of the regression model, we performed seven field trials with captive barnacle geese on Festuca rubra salt marshes. The regression model proved reliable except when salt concentrations in the food were high following inundation by spring tides. The results obtained from this study further demonstrated its value in estimating the individual digestibility of each plant species in mixed diets. This is illustrated with reference to a study of food selection by brent geese Branta bernicla.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics of Soil Organic Carbon in Newborn Coastal Wetlands of the Yellow River Delta Estuary
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and seasonal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in newborn coastal wetland of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) estuary at eastern China were studied based on monitoring data in 2009 at two transects from the bank of the Yellow River to the seaside. The results showed that SOC contents of 0-60cm soil layer in transects ranged from 0.46 to 10.15gkg(-1) and average values of soil profiles ranged from 2.15 to 5.00gkg(-1). The SOC contents tended to increase from the river flood land to the salt beach, which could be accounted for the organic matters including large algae, the bodies and excretion of marine animals due to the feedback of tides. The significant difference of SOC contents at different vegetation communities was observed, while the difference of SOC in soil profiles was not obvious. The SOC contents in 0-30cm soil layers decreased with plant growth period, while in 40-60cm soil layers were relatively stable. The mean soil organic carbon density was 3.05kgCm(-2) in study region, which was much lower than that reported in other ecosystems, and its spatiotemporal variations were consistent with that of SOC content. Further analysis revealed that SOC was positively correlated with total nitrogen and clay contents. Our findings indicated that the newborn coastal wetland in the YRD should be a potential sink of SOC.

TI  - Antioxidant enzyme activities and hormonal status inresponse to Cd stress in the wetland halophyte Kosteletzkya virginica under saline conditions
T2  - PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes constitute major sinks for heavy metal accumulation but the precise impact of salinity on heavy metal toxicity for halophyte plant species remains largely unknown. Young seedlings of Kosteletzkya virginica were exposed during 3 weeks in nutrient solution to Cd 5 mu M in the presence or absence of 50 mM NaCl. Cadmium (Cd) reduced growth and shoot water content and had major detrimental effect on maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Y(II)) and electron transport rates (ETRs). Cd induced an oxidative stress in relation to an increase in O2 center dot and H2O2 concentration and lead to a decrease in endogenous glutathione (GSH) and -tocopherol in the leaves. Cd not only increased leaf zeatin and zeatin riboside concentration but also increased the senescing compounds 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and abscisic acid (ABA). Salinity reduced Cd accumulation already after 1 week of stress but was unable to restore shoot growth and thus did not induce any dilution effect. Salinity delayed the Cd-induced leaf senescence: NaCl reduced the deleterious impact of Cd on photosynthesis apparatus through an improvement of Fv/Fm, Y(II) and ETR. Salt reduced oxidative stress in Cd-treated plants through an increase in GSH, -tocopherol and ascorbic acid synthesis and an increase in glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) activity. Additional salt reduced ACC and ABA accumulation in Cd+NaCl-treated leaves comparing to Cd alone. It is concluded that salinity affords efficient protection against Cd to the halophyte species K. virginica, in relation to an improved management of oxidative stress and hormonal status.

TI  - Evaluation of saltgrass as a fodder crop for livestock
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland salinization due to unsustainable agricultural practices has become a worldwide problem. Salt-resistant forage crops, introduced at the primary stages of land reclamation, can provide fodder for livestock, thus adding economic benefit to the process. Saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), a wild halophytic grass species distributed in salt marshes in America, is occasionally grazed by livestock and wild animals. In attempts to domesticate this species, we evaluated and ranked the fodder potential of groups of accessions from several sites in North and South America. Ash content never exceeded 110g kg(-1), even when plants were grown with salty water. Crude protein content was variable and averaged 116g kg(-1) of DM. Mean yield of metabolizable energy was 6.30 and 5.61 kJ g(-1) DM for sheep and goats, respectively. Organic matter digestibility (in vitro) was higher in sheep than in goats (506 g kg(-1) and 478 g kg(-1), respectively) for all saltgrass accessions. Differences in quality parameters were usually larger within than among groups of accession when sorted according to country of origin or ecosystem. Accessions from the South Atlantic coast of North America and from South America were superior in several parameters. South Atlantic coast accessions were relatively vigorous and were productive under saline conditions, as indicated by their relative growth rate (RGR) in small-scale experiments. Six outstanding saltgrass accessions were chosen for further examination. The results of the present study indicate that saltgrass holds considerable promise for selection and suggest that efforts should continue to identify and characterize additional saltgrass ecotypes.

AB  - The relationships between the bioaccumulation of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, Cd, and Pb, acidity (pH), salinity (Ec), and organic matter content within trophic levels (water-soil-plants-invertebrates) were studied in saline environments in Poland. Environments included sodium manufactures, wastes utilization areas, dumping grounds, and agriculture cultivation, where disturbed Ca, Mg, and Fe exist and the impact of Cd and Pb is high. We found Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, and Cd accumulation in the leaves of plants and in invertebrates. Our aim was to determine the selectivity exhibited by soil for nutrients and heavy metals and to estimate whether it is important in elucidating how these metals are available for plant/animal uptake in addition to their mobility and stability within soils. We examined four ecological plant groups: trees, shrubs, minor green plants, and water macrophytes. Among invertebrates, we sampled breastplates Malacostraca, small arachnids Arachnida, diplopods Diplopoda, small insects Insecta, and snails Gastropoda. A higher level of chemical elements was found in saline polluted areas (sodium manufactures and anthropogenic sites). Soil acidity and salinity determined the bioaccumulation of free radicals in the trophic levels measured. A pH decrease caused Zn and Cd to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Ca, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb in the anthropogenic sites. pH increase also caused Na, Mg, and Fe to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Na, Fe, Mn, and Co in the anthropogenic sites. There was a significant correlation between these chemical elements and Ec in soils. We found significant relationships between pH and Ec, which were positive in saline areas of sodium manufactures and negative in the anthropogenic and control sites. These dependencies testify that the measurement of the selectivity of cations and their fluctuation in soils provide essential information on the affinity and binding strength in these environments. The chemical elements accumulated in soils and plants; however, further flow is selective and variable. The selectivity exhibited by soil systems for nutrients and heavy metals is important in elucidating how these metals become available for plant/animal uptake and also their mobility and stability in soils.

TI  - Evaluation of sensor types and environmental controls on mapping biomass of coastal marsh emergent vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need to quantify large-scale plant productivity in coastal marshes to understand marsh resilience to sea level rise, to help define eligibility for carbon offset credits, and to monitor impacts from land use, eutrophication and contamination. Remote monitoring of aboveground biomass of emergent wetland vegetation will help address this need. Differences in sensor spatial resolution, bandwidth, temporal frequency and cost constrain the accuracy of biomass maps produced for management applications. In addition the use of vegetation indices to map biomass may not be effective in wetlands due to confounding effects of water inundation on spectral reflectance. To address these challenges, we used partial least squares regression to select optimal spectral features in situ and with satellite reflectance data to develop predictive models of aboveground biomass for common emergent freshwater marsh species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus acutus, at two restored marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA. We used field spectrometer data to test model errors associated with hyperspectral narrowbands and multispectral broadbands, the influence of water inundation on prediction accuracy, and the ability to develop species specific models. We used Hyperion data, Digital Globe World View-2 (WV-2) data, and Landsat 7 data to scale up the best statistical models of biomass. Field spectrometer-based models of the full dataset showed that narrowband reflectance data predicted biomass somewhat, though not significantly better than broadband reflectance data [R-2 = 0.46 and percent normalized RMSE (%RMSE) = 16% for narrowband models]. However hyperspectral first derivative reflectance spectra best predicted biomass for plots where water levels were less than 15 cm (R-2 = 0.69, %RMSE = 12.6%). In species-specific models, error rates differed by species (Typha spp.: %RMSE = 18.5%; S. acutus: %RMSE = 24.9%), likely due to the more vertical structure and deeper water habitat of S. acutus. The Landsat 7 dataset (7 images) predicted biomass slightly better than the WV-2 dataset (6 images) (R-2 = 0.56, %RMSE = 20.9%, compared to R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 21.5%). The Hyperion dataset (one image) was least successful in predicting biomass (R-2 = 027, %RMSE = 33.5%). Shortwave infrared bands on 30 m-resolution Hyperion and Landsat 7 sensors aided biomass estimation; however managers need to weigh tradeoffs between cost, additional spectral information, and high spatial resolution that will identify variability in small, fragmented marshes common to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere in the Western U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Reconciling opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean: Continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite their moderately sized surface area, continental marginal seas play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, as they receive huge amounts of upwelled and riverine inputs of carbon and nutrients, sustaining a disproportionate large biological activity compared to their relative surface area. A synthesis of worldwide measurements of the partial pressure Of CO2 (pCO(2)) indicates that most open shelves in the temperate and high-latitude regions are under-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 during all seasons, although the low-latitude shelves seem to be over-saturated. Most inner estuaries and near-shore coastal areas on the other hand are over-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2. The scaling of air-sea CO2 fluxes based on pCO(2) measurements and carbon mass-balance calculations indicate that the continental shelves absorb atmospheric CO2 ranging between 0.33 and 0.36 Pg C yr(-1) that corresponds to an additional sink of 27% to similar to 30% of the CO2 uptake by the open oceans based on the most recent pCO(2) climatology [Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S.C., Wanninkhof, R., Sweeney, C., Feely, R.A., Chipman, D., Hales, B., Friederich, G., Chavez, F., Watson, A., Bakker, D., Schuster, U., Metzl, N., Inoue, H.Y., Ishii, M., Midorikawa, T., Sabine, C., Hoppema, M., Olafsson, J., Amarson, T., Tilbrook, B., Johannessen, T., Olsen, A., Bellerby, R., De Baar, H., Nojiri, Y., Wong. C.S., Delille, B., Bates, N., 2009. Climatological mean and decadal change in surface ocean pCO(2), and net sea-air CO2 flux over the global oceans. Deep-Sea Research 11, this issue [doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.2008.12.009].]. Inner estuaries, salt marshes and mangroves emit up to 0.50 Pg C yr(-1), although these estimates are prone to large uncertainty due to poorly constrained ecosystem surface area estimates. Nevertheless, the view of continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2 allows reconciling long-lived opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.

TI  - A Detailed Insight into the Detrital and Diagenetic Mineralogy of Metal(oid)s: Their Origin, Distribution and Associations within Hypersaline Sediments
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypersaline environments are among the most vulnerable coastal ecosystems and are extremely noteworthy for a variety of ecological reasons. Comprehensive assessment of metal(oid) contamination in hypersaline sediments from Secovlje (Northern Adriatic, Slovenia) was addressed by introducing the detrital and diagenetic mineralogy and geochemical properties within the solid sediment material. Close associations between Fe/Mn oxides and oxyhydroxides with As, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, and between organic matter with Cu, Pb and Zn were confirmed using X-ray powder diffraction, SEM-EDS and ICP emission spectrometry analysis. Possible incorporation or adsorption on the crystal lattices of clay minerals (As, Cr, Pb, Sn and Zn), halite (As) and aragonite/calcite (Cd, Cu, Pb, Sr and Zn) were also detected. All presented correlations were highlighted by various statistical analyses. The enrichment factor (EF) values showed a low degree of anthropogenic burden for As, Bi, Hg and Zn, while Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Sr originated from the geological background. These results emphasise that a detailed mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of solid (especially detrital and diagenetic) sediment particles is crucial in further understanding the metal(oid) translocation within the hypersaline ecosystems.

TI  - Use of seagrass wrack in restoring disturbed Australian saltmarshes
T2  - Ecological Management & Restoration
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are threatened in many parts of the world, considered wastelands rather than valued as wetlands. This is particularly true in urbanized parts of Australia. Approximately 85% of saltmarsh has been lost or severely damaged in the Tuggerah Lakes of the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. Wrack (rotting vegetation) can promote diversity of saltmarshes, by shading soil and reducing physical stress and/or by providing nutrients to nutrient-poor soil. In many parts of the world, wrack derives from the saltmarsh plants. On the shores of the Tuggerah Lakes, large amounts of seagrass wrack (with varying amounts of macro-algae), are stranded along the shoreline and in the remaining saltmarshes. This is perceived to reduce public amenity and have no ecological value. Thus, the local council is under pressure to remove wrack. This experimental study examined the influence of wrack on cover and diversity of saltmarsh and provided preliminary data on changes to organic matter and benthos in the sediment. On average, there was a rapid increase in biomass of the dominant plant, Sarcocornia quinqueflora, in experimental areas where wrack was added, although the response was patchy, but there was no change in diversity over 22 months. There were limited changes to benthos, but no changes to nutrients in the sediment in wracked compared to unwracked treatments. Nevertheless, increased biomass in dominant species may reduce physical stress for other smaller saltmarsh plants. This study is part of a programme examining the interaction between the persistence and growth of saltmarshes and recycling of wrack in the lakes. The ultimate aim is to develop ecologically and economically sound plans of management for an increasingly urbanized area of the NSW coast.

TI  - Tidal wetland stability in the face of human impacts and sea-level rise
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal populations and wetlands have been intertwined for centuries, whereby humans both influence and depend on the extensive ecosystem services that wetlands provide. Although coastal wetlands have long been considered vulnerable to sea-level rise, recent work has identified fascinating feedbacks between plant growth and geomorphology that allow wetlands to actively resist the deleterious effects of sea-level rise. Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate, nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors that influence transgression into adjacent uplands.

TI  - Distribution and deposition characteristics of carbon and nitrogen in sediments in a semi-closed bay area, southeast China
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed carbon and nitrogen parameters (e.g., total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), stable isotopes of organic matter (delta C-13, delta N-15), and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N)), grain-size parameters and deposition rate, as well as their variations in the surface layer and on the profile of the sediment cores in various ecological zones of Luoyuan Bay. The results showed that the sedimentary type of Luoyuan Bay was clay silt. The TOC, TN, delta C-13, and delta N-15 were in the range of 0.450-0.955%, 0.054-0.101%, -23.75 to - 19.47%o, and 3.57-6.72%, respectively; the C/N was in the range of 8.80-13.78. The grain-size parameters of the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were similar, whereas a similarity in the carbon and nitrogen parameters between the transition zone and mudflat was observed. The correlation of TOC and TN was different between the fresh organic matter and the obsolete organic matter. The particle size was not the main factor that controlled the TOC and TN contents in the sediments; the delta C-13 indicated the organic matter was dominated by marine sources. The average deposition rates in the Spartina alterniflora marsh, transition zone, and mudflat were 2.47, 2.79, 1.16 g cm(-2) y(-1), respectively. In the Spartina alterniflora marsh, the TOC and TN content increased by 96% and 104%, respectively, from 1955 to the present. Compared with the mudflat, the TOC and TN content in the layer between the surface and the 40-cm depth of the Spartina alterniflora marsh were 26% and 13% higher, respectively. The introduction of Spartina alterniflora and the metabolism of their roots had a significant effect on the carbon and nitrogen deposition in the layer at 0-40 cm depth. The carbon sequestration rate of the salt marsh wetland in Luoyuan Bay was comparable to the carbon sequestration of global marshes. The deposition rates of TOC and TN in the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were greater than twice that in the mudflat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Origin and composition of sediment organic matter in a coastal semi-enclosed ecosystem: An elemental and isotopic study at the ecosystem space scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The origin and composition of sediment organic matter (SOM) were investigated together with its spatial distribution in the Arcachon Bay - a macrotidal lagoon that shelters the largest Zostera noltii meadow in Europe - using elemental and isotopic ratios. Subtidal and intertidal sediments and primary producers were both sampled in April 2009. Their elemental and isotopic compositions were assessed. Relative contributions of each source to SOM were estimated using a mixing model. The SOM composition tended to be homogeneous over the whole ecosystem and reflected the high diversity of primary producers in this system. On average, SOM was composed of 25% of decayed phanerogams, 19% of microphytobenthos, 20% of phytoplankton, 19% of river SPOM and 17% of macroalgae. There was no evidence of anthropogenic N-sources and SOM was mainly of autochthonous origin. None of the tested environmental parameters - salinity, current speed, emersion, granulometry and chlorophyll a - nor a combination of them explained the low spatial variability of SOM composition and characteristics. Resuspension, mixing and redistribution of the different particulate organic matters by wind-induced and tidal currents in combination with shallow depth probably explain the observed homogeneity at the whole bay scale.

CP  - 103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting
CL  - Washington, DC, USA
AB  - Nutrient cycles in coastal marine sediments respond to a variety of factors such as the source and quality of organic matter, the effects of anaerobic remineralization (particularly sulfate reduction), and the activities of macroorganisms that ultimately affect redox conditions. In the majority of salt marshes along the east coast of the U.S., the mud fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, is the predominant macrofauna, while Spartina alterniflora is the predominant macrophyte. Sulfate-reduction rates and counts of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were profiled in the top 10 cm depth of sediments using a stratified random sampling design over an entire marsh basin that was mapped using GIS techniques. Tall Spartina (TS) and Creek Bank (CB) marsh zones were studied during summer and winter seasons, while the Short Spartina (SS) zone was studied only during summer. Depth-integrated sulfate-reduction rates (SRR) were highest during summer in TS regions of the marsh (46-77 mmol m-2 d-1), during the macrophytes' active growth state. Increased macrofaunal bioturbation decreased SRR temporally and spatially, therefore, those sites with more plants and fewer burrows had the highest rates. SS had the lowest summer SRR (26-31 mmol m-2 d-1), while the TS sites showed the lowest winter SRR. Nonbioturbated, unvegetated sites had the highest SRR during winter (0.32-1.86 mmol m-2 d-1). A most probable number (MPN) method determined SRB abundance as highest in nonbioturbated sites during summer, and the presence of Spartina further increased abundances (up to 2.4X1011 cells ml-1). Winter MPNs showed few differences between sites with counts averaging 106 cells ml-1. Both SRB activity and abundance were affected by seasonal changes in Spartina biomass and Uca bioturbation acting in concert. The data presented here indicate that SRB communities in coastal marine sediments are primarily controlled by the concentration and delivery of substrates (electron donors and acceptors). Currently, the effects of macroorganisms on SRB community composition are being elucidated using molecular techniques.

AB  - Study of distribution pattern of different sulphur fraction's along the Kerala coast shows that sulphur diagenesis was active in clay and silt dominated sediments. Storage of sulphur to sediments In this coast was found to be in the organic form. Reducing environment induced by the high content of organic matter is considered to be the major factor which controls the distribution of different S species. Significant concentrations of AVS-S and other reduced S species clearly supports the presence of a reducing environment in the sediments of Kerala Coast.

T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Search for bioindicators in marine environments has provided new tools for monitoring global and local natural changes. Among these tools, benthic foraminifera play a central role. More accurate paleogeographical and paleoecological reconstructions become possible on the basis of the ecology of recent foraminifera. Nevertheless, factors acting on foraminiferal assemblages are still partially understood. The aim of this study is to correlate the distribution patterns of living (stained) benthic foraminifera with environmental variables such as tidal elevation, interstitial pore water salinity. organic matter content of the sediment, pheopigments. chlorophyll a, carbonate contents and grain size distribution of the sediment from 86 samples collected in the Aiguillon cove (France). In this paralic environment, sediment grain size. salinity and tidal elevation are fundamental factors that drive the distribution of the most abundant species i.e. Brizalina variabilis, Cribroelphidium excavatum and Haynesina germanica. Organic matter also influences the distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera: the relative abundance of Ammonia tepida is typically favored by all increase of total organic matter food resources. Chlorophyll a and pheopigments, as indicators of organic matter quality however may not be limiting in the proportion present in the Aiguillon cove. Carbonate proportions do not limit benthic foraminifera of the Aiguillon cove essentially with carbonaceous shells.

TI  - SULFUR, IRON AND ORGANIC-CARBON FLUXES IN THE BLACK-SEA - SULFUR ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FOR ORIGIN OF SULFUR FLUXES
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southern and central Black Sea, reduced sulfur comprises nearly 1% of the total particulate flux in the anoxic water column, as measured by time-series sediment traps. Sulfur isotopic composition of particulate sulfide fluxes indicates an origin near the oxic-anoxic interface, where dissolved sulfide is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulfide below 175 m due to chemical oxidation. A strong seasonal correlation exists between sulfur and organic carbon fluxes; this, together with particulate sulfide precipitation at the oxic-anoxic interface, suggests that sulfides are scavenged from the interface during maximum production of settling organic aggregates, particularly during the late summer coccolithophorid blooms. Sulfide precipitation deeper in the water column and in sediments may be limited by availability of iron and/or polysulfides, since there are no particulate sulfide fluxes which have the same isotopic composition as ambient dissolved sulfide at trap depths. Since sulfides in surface sediments are often isotopically similar to dissolved sulfide at the top of the sulfide zone and to sediment trap fluxes, sedimentary sulfides could originate from metal sulfide fluxes forming at the oxic-anoxic interface and would reflect sulfur-cycling processes at the oxic-anoxic interface. Sedimentary sulfate reduction rates estimated from assuming 65-80% utilization of particulate organic carbon fluxes agree reasonably well with other estimates of sulfate reduction and sulfide production rates. A sulfur isotope-based box-model for sulfur cycling between dissolved and particulate phases in the water column and sediments is presented.

Higher densities (no. 1m-2) of meiofauna were observed in low water mark (143.68 cm-2) and mid water mark (119.2 cm-2) at 0-5 cm depth. A positive correlation between meiofaunal densities and median sorted sediments with high organic matter was observed. Harpacticoid copepod density (28.74cm-2) was found to be 2 times higher than that reported for salt marsh. However, nematodes (108.78 cm-2) showed lower densities than those reported for other estuarine habitats.

AB  - We monitored coastal wetland vertical accretion, elevation gain and surface carbon (C) at Homebush Bay, Australia over 18 years (2000-2017) in three settings initially characterized by saltmarsh, mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone and mangrove-dominated zones. During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period. The result suggests that the C accumulation and surface elevation gains made as a result of mangrove colonization may not be observable over initial decades, but will be significant in the longer term as forests reach maturity.

The Lower site is dominated by marine phytoplankton, the Middle site is dominated by a mixture of salt marsh and phytoplankton and the Upper site is dominated by oligohaline phytoplankton and fresh marsh.Ten functional groups will be sampled at each site (Surface sediment, benthic diatoms, Nereis, mummichog, ribbed mussels, POM, blue mussels, pelagic copepods (Acartia), silversides and soft shell clams (Mya). Marsh, benthic algae and phytoplankton inputs or benthic vs. pelagic pathways will be evident in the isotopic signals of these functional groups. Samples will be collected between the middle and end of August to reflect a growing season using recently produced OM. Samples of 15 - 20 individuals will be pooled for analysis. Some silverside samplings will have 3 different pooled samples for determination of variance. Often times the same species are not collected at each site due to habitat differences (salinity/discharge) so additional species are collected to try to accomplish task of getting functional groups collected.

TI  - Microbial Fe(III) reduction in a minerotrophic wetland - geochemical controls and involvement in organic matter decomposition
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the geochemistry of Fe in a minerotrophic wetland in Central New York. Fine-scale geochemical trends in the peat and peat porewater were investigated to evaluate detailed vertical profiles of Fe in solution. Two sites within the wetland were examined: one site adjacent to an agricultural field receiving nutrient inputs and another (pristine) site in the middle of the wetland. Results revealed that Fe(II) was produced in situ in the wetland, most probably as a result of microbial Fe(III) reduction. Iron(II) concentration profiles suggested the existence of Fe(III) reduction in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field, whereas no significant evidence for Fe(III) reduction occurred in the pristine zone. Theoretical equilibrium modeling predicted that the difference in soluble Fe concentrations between the two zones was probably caused by abiotic reactions, such as pyrite precipitation. Geochemically, a correlation between Fe(II) and bulk density showed the importance of Fe reduction in the decomposition of organic matter in the organic rich peat and demonstrated the importance of the mineralogical composition for the reduction of Fe(III). Finally, a unique reversal of Fe and SO42- reduction was discovered in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling Soil Porewater Salinity Response to Drought in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing concern about the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion via tidal rivers, streams, and creeks into tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) due to sea level rise (SLR) and intense and extended drought events. However, the magnitude and duration of porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 practical salinity units, psu) and the controlling factors remain unclear. In this study, we developed a TFFW soil porewater salinity model, in which the feedback mechanisms between soil salinity and evapotranspiration and hydraulic conductivity were incorporated. We selected sites (upper, middle, lower tidal freshwater forest sites, and oligohaline marsh site) along the coastal floodplains of two rivers, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA), that represent landscape salinity gradients from tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold.Plain Language Summary Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide valuable ecosystem services to society including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, water quality improvement, and habitat for critical wildlife species. However, TFFW are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) and extreme drought events. Salinity stress to TFFW is often reflected in elevated soil porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 psu). Soil porewater salinity magnitude and dynamics at sites along two coastal floodplains, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA) exposed to drought-induced saltwater intrusion during 2008-2016 were studied using a physical and ecological process-driven soil salinity model. The mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity at TFFW sites increased significantly with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, even without SLR, compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, thus posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services in TFFW. Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator and the soil porewater salinity model can be used for predicting changes in the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of salinity stress to TFFW sites under future climate change.Key PointsDrought-induced saltwater intrusion significantly increases soil porewater salinity in soils of tidal freshwater forested wetlands Tidal freshwater forest sites located near the tidal marsh boundary will suffer more severe salinity stress with climate change Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator for tidal freshwater forested wetland condition

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) were measured in surface intertidal saltmarsh and bare tidal flat sediments along the Rudong coast. The distribution and sources of organic carbon were examined under different depositional environments based on C/N ratios and a two-terminal mixing model. The results showed that the average TOC content of the vegetated saltmarsh sediments, bare tidal flat areas near vegetation (BF1), and bare tidal flat areas far from vegetation (BF2) were 4.05, 2.72, and 1.22 mg/g, respectively. The mean delta C-13 value within the vegetated saltmarsh area was -22.37 parts per thousand, and the C/N ratio was 9.3; the corresponding values in the BF1 area were -23.27 parts per thousand and 7.95, respectively; and in the BF2 area, the corresponding values were -21.91 parts per thousand and 5.36, respectively. These C/N ratios reflect an increasing marine contribution with distance from the vegetated zone. Combined with the two-terminal mixing model, the organic carbon in the vegetated saltmarsh sediments was dominated by terrestrial sources, while the bare tidal flat sediments were more influenced by marine sources, and the bare tidal flat sediments nearer to the vegetated zone (BF1) were influenced by a combination of vegetation, marine sources, and other terrestrial factors.

AB  - Mediterranean halophytic rush vegetation was studied in the coastal marshes found in the Valencia region (Spain). Species achieving a frequency gt 10% in vegetation releves have been considered: Aeluropus littoralis, Artemisia caerulescens subsp. gallica, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Aster tripolium subsp. tripolium, Carex extensa, Centaurium spicatum, Inula crithmoides, Juncus acutus, Juncus maritimus, Juncus subulatus, Linum maritimum, Phragmites australis, Plantago crassifolia, Samolus valerandi, Schoenus nigricans, Scirpus maritimus var. compactus, Sonchus maritimus subsp. maritimus and Suaeda maritima. Four sociological groups were established by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and their relationship to edaphic factors (water level, pH, total calcium carbonate lime (active calcium carbonate), sulphates, organic matter, conductivity over saturation extract of the soil, salinity, Ca++, Mg++, Na+, Cl-, S.A.R., total nitrogen and texture) were carried out using statistical analysis. Soil texture, total nitrogen and active calcium carbonate have a significant correlation on the distribution of this species. High lime content allows some glycophytes to support high concentrations of salt.

T2  - 2008 IEEE/OES US/EU-BALTIC INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE/OES Us/EU-Baltic International Symposium
CL  - Tallinn, ESTONIA
AB  - Iron (Fe) plaque formation is a well known phenomenon in wetland, freshwater and salt marsh species; however there are no reports about Fe plaque occurrence in seagrasses. Here we review the main factors regulating Fe deposition on the roots and rhizomes of plants from reduced sediments/soils, and discuss these factors in relation to marine environment. Moreover, we present some early observations and quantification of Fe plaque on the tropical seagrass Cymodocea serrulata. Based on these first results and literature data, we compare the seagrass C. serrulata with the freshwater macrophyte Lobelia dortmanna performance and efficiency with regard to plaque formation. The comparison shows that regardless of the lower oxygen release to the sediment and less favourable sediment conditions with high pH, low organic matter content, high carbonate content and actively ongoing sulphate reduction, the seagrass is able to develop significant Fe plaques on roots and rhizomes. Thus we conclude that seagrasses have the necessary characteristics for plaque formation, and that marine sediments may be a favourable environment for Fe plaque development. Moreover, we suggest the likelihood of finding Fe deposits also on other species than C. serrulata and in other geographical locations.

TI  - Biochemical and photochemical feedbacks of acute Cd toxicity in Juncus acutus seedlings: The role of non-functional Cd-chlorophylls
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing metal pollution in salt marshes and its influence on the plants that inhabit these ecosystems, has become a major concern with serious implications on the species establishment. Juncus coitus is a highly common halophyte specie in Portuguese marshes. Seeds from his specie were exposed to a range of different Cd concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mu M) in order to evaluate the effects of acute Cd stress on seed germination and growth as well as on seedling pigment composition, photosynthetic apparatus and oxidative stress biomarkers. Seedling length was higher than in control in every Cd treatment, however biomass showed a decrease. It was also observed that increasing Cd treatments, lead to a proportional increase in the Cd tissue concentration. Also the Cd-substituted chlorophylls showed an increase with increasing Cd doses that were applied. This substitution results in a non-functional chlorophyll molecule, highly unstable under moderate light intensities which inevitably reduces the efficiency of the LHC II. As consequence, there was a decrease in the use-efficiency of the harvested energy, leading to a decay in the photosynthetic capacity and energy accumulation, which was dissipated as heat. As for the antioxidant enzymes, SOD and APX presented higher activity, responding to increasing cadmium concentrations. Thus, becomes evident that Cd affects negatively, both biochemically and photochemically, the establishment by seed process of J. acutus highlighting the potential of the use of this specie seed as potential sentinel and ecotoxicity test in extreme conditions.

TI  - Import, export, and recycling of dissolved nutrients in the Ogeechee River estuary (Georgia, USA)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed an empirical mass balance model of nutrient fluxes in the Ogeechee River estuary (Georgia, USA) from eight surveys of seasonal estuarine nutrient concentrations during 2015 and 2016. The model results indicated a net removal of dissolved phosphorus and a net production of dissolved nitrogen (N) within the estuary over an annual cycle. During summer and autumn low flow periods, much of the dissolved N discharged to the ocean seems to be recycled into the estuary in the form of phytoplankton biomass. As a result, the outwelled N is not new nitrogen fueling coastal production but is nitrogen trapped within a recycling loop across the ocean-estuarine boundary. Higher flows in the fall and winter lead to direct discharge of nutrients with minimal recycling. A balanced N budget for the Ogeechee River estuary requires that estuarine N-fixation must exceed burial and denitrification losses within the estuary.

M3  - Data set
AB  - The dataset details organic carbon content of sediments across 6 intertidal sites in the winter and summer of 2013. The data provide a quantitative measure of the organic carbon present within surface sediments (up to a depth of 2 cm). Three sites were located in Essex, South East England and the other 3 in Morecambe Bay, North West England. Each site consisted of a saltmarsh habitat and adjacent mudflat habitat. 22 sampling quadrats were placed in each habitat covering 4 spatial scales. 3 replicate samples of surface sediment were collected at each quadrat. They were then processed for organic carbon content using the Loss on Ignition method (detailed below) Values are expressed as a percentage of the total sample collected. This data was collected as part of Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS): NE/J015644/1. The project was funded with support from the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (BESS) programme. BESS is a six-year programme (2011-2017) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as part of the UK's Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) programme. The location of the sample sites was determined by randomly allocated quadrats. Twenty two 1 x 1 m quadrats were randomly allocated to each mudflat and saltmarsh site using R (R Development Core Team, 2014) to specify four different spatial scales (A = 1 quadrat only, B = 3 quadrats at 1 m to 10 m apart, C = 6 quadrats at 10 m to 100 m apart, D = 12 quadrats at 100 m to 1000 m or site maximum). Mudflats: surface scrapes of sediment were taken. Saltmarsh: sediment was cut from 2cm below the surface. All samples were frozen at minus 20 degrees and then analysed using standard loss on ignition (LOI) technique, full details of which can be found here: http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/facilities/laboratories/techniques/loi.html Copyright: This resource is made available under the terms of the Open Government Licence

TI  - Organochlorine contaminants in a coastal lagoon in Argentina: Analysis of sediment, crabs, and cordgrass from two different habitats
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Burrowing crabs (Chasmagnathus granulata), sediment collected from inside and outside crab burrows as well as outside the crab bed, and cordgrass (Spartina densiflora) were collected from intertidal mudflat and cordgrass marsh habitats and analyzed for concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and organochlorine (OC) compounds to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the distribution and bioaccumulation of OC contaminants in coastal lagoon habitats in Argentina. PCB concentrations were relatively low, although the penta- and hexachlorobiphenyl detected in sediments and biota indicated that there had been direct inputs of PCBs into the ecosystem. Heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endosulfan sulphate, chlordane compounds, DDT and metabolites, and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were the major pesticides detected in sediment and biota samples. When lipid-normalized concentration data for all OC pesticides in crabs were summed together (Sigma OCC), there were higher concentrations in crabs from the cordgrass habitat in comparison to crabs from the mudflat. In sediment samples, there were no significant differences in percent organic matter of marsh and mudflat sediments, but the concentrations of Sigma OCC normalized to organic carbon were higher in the sediments collected in the cordgrass marsh. Samples of rhizomes and roots from the cordgrass contained high concentrations of OC compounds and it was estimated that 2.4 kg of heptachlor epoxide, the most abundant OC pesticide, may be present in the total cordgrass root biomass in Mar Chiquita lagoon. These data indicated that the cordgrass in coastal lagoon environments is an important factor in determining the distribution of persistent contaminants, and that a significant portion of the total burden of these hydrophobic compounds may be deposited in cordgrass biomass.

TI  - Biogeochemical controls on reaction of sedimentary organic matter and aqueous sulfides in holocene sediments of Mud Lake, Florida
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and quantity of organic sulfur and iron sulfur species were determined in the Holocene sediments from Mud Lake, Florida. The sediments of this shallow, sinkhole lake are characterized by high sulfur and organic carbon contents as well as active sulfate reduction. They record a shift from a basal peat (below 2 in) comprised of water lily-dominated organic matter to the present cyanobacterial/algal-dominated lake deposit (upper I m). This shift in depositional environment and subsequent organic matter source was accompanied by variation in the amount of reactive iron delivered to the sediments, which in turn influenced the type and extent of organic matter sulfurization. Extractable intramolecular organic sulfur is principally found as C(25) highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) thiolanes. Extractable poly Sulfide-linked lipids, determined by selective chemical cleavage with MeLi/MeI and analyzed as methylthioethers (MTE), are dominated by n-alkanes with sulfur attachments at position 1 and 2, as well as lower amounts of C(25) HBI-MTE. The delta(13)C values and carbon-chain length distribution of both series of n-alkylMTE indicate that they are derived from distinct biological precursors. Among the n-alkyIMTE with sulfur attachment at position I there are three homologous series: one saturated and two with both cis and trans enethiol isomers. The identification of the enethiol in the sulfur-linked macromolecules indicates that n-alkylaldehydes are precursors lipids. The intervals of high concentration of bulk organic sulfur and sulfurized lipids coincide with the intervals of high mineral sulfur content (acid volatile sulfide and chromium reducible sulfur). We suggest that the main control on the enhanced addition of sulfur to the organic matter in Mud Lake was the increased formation of polysulfides during the reduction of iron hydroxides and the subsequent reaction of those polysulfides with mildly oxidized sedimentary organic matter, Copyright (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediments and the associated biota constitute an important compartment in the biogeochemical cycle of trace metals in soft substrate megatidal estuaries. The relationship between physicochemical, ecological properties, metal concentrations determined in megatidal estuary sediments from the French coast of the English Channel, the Baie des Veys and the macrobenthic organisms, are analysed, interpreted and reported. Total concentrations of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper were measured in mudflats and saltmarsh sediments using Differential Pulse Voltammetry. Sediment characteristics were obtained by measurement of particle size, water content, total organic carbon and carbonate content, using AFNOR standards. A semi-quantitative scale was used for assessing the density of the macrobenthic flora and fauna at each sampling site. Analysis of data obtained from this study showed a correlation between the concentrations of monitored trace metals and species of the macrobenthic fauna. The results of this study show that the physico-chemical characteristics of the sediments affect the retention of metals in the sediment and this in turn affects the biota.

TI  - Changes in soil microbial biomass and community composition in coastal wetlands affected by restoration projects in a Chinese delta
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Severely degraded wetlands due to the lack of freshwater were restored by reintroducing freshwater through the placement of artificial dikes and channels in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China. Many studies have evaluated the performances of this restoration projects in aspects of vegetation, soils, hydrology, wildlife, etc. In contrast, limited information was available on the effects of restoration projects on the soil microbial biomass and community composition. To better understand the wetland restoration, differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition between restored tidal wetlands and unrestored wetlands under the disturbance of petroleum exploitation activities or tidal intrusion were assessed. Surface soils (0-10 cm) under three different plant covers (Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa and bare land) were collected from each three wetland zones. Chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis were used to characterize soil microbial biomass and community composition. Our results showed significantly elevated microbial biomass in soils of the restoration zone, as indicated by both microbial biomass carbon and total PLFAs. Soil microbial community composition in the restoration zone also differed significantly from those in the petroleum exploitation zone and tidal zone. The freshwater input of restoration projects induced a soil microbial community shift to the increased relative abundance of fungi and decreased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio bacteria. The significantly promoted fungi in soils under P. australis of the restoration zone reflected the necessity of decomposers of the increased surface plant residues after restoration, which in turn contributed to the organic residues accumulation in soils and large aggregates formation by fungal hyphae. Meanwhile the modified soil carbon pool and aggregate structure following restoration of degraded wetland may favor the colonization of soil organisms. These results indicated that freshwater input had strongly altered soil microbial communities in the restored wetland, which may be of great significance in understanding the soil microbial responses to the restoration projects and the underlying mechanisms of wetland restoration.

TI  - Distribution and contamination assessment of heavy metals in soils from tidal flat, oil exploitation zone and restored wetland in the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal distributions were monitored along soil profiles and their sources as well as ecological risks were assessed in tidal zone (T), petroleum exploitation zone (P) and restoration zone (R) under different vegetation covers- Phragmites australis (p), Suaeda salsa (s) and bare land (b) in Yellow River estuary (YRE). In the three zones, mean concentrations of metals and mean values of potential ecological risk index (RI) kept the order of P > T > R. For different vegetation covers, the order of mean concentrations and ecological risk factor of all metals was b > s > p in zone P, while it shifted to p > b > s in zone T and p > s > b in zone R, respectively. Principal component analysis inferred that As, Cu, Ni and Zn were derived from natural alluviation and sedimentation, while Cd and Pb were derived from allochthonous inputs and air emissions of oil extraction. Correlation analysis indicated that soil organic matter, moisture, large aggregates as well as electric conductivity were key factors influencing metal distributions in these zones. Although YRE was not heavily polluted by heavy metals, it should be vigilant for metal accumulation in 20-30 cm layer of oil spilled soils, and zones P and T with high RI greatly contributed by Cd.

TI  - The rates and pathways of carbon oxidation in bioturbated saltmarsh sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to quantify the effects of higher organisms, invertebrate macrofauna, and macrophyte plants on the rates and pathways of microbial respiration coupled to organic matter oxidation in saltmarsh sediments. Sediment geochemistry, rates of microbial metabolism, and the abundance of anaerobic respiratory bacteria were determined at sites differing in the abundance of fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) burrows and vegetation (Spartina ulterniflora) coverage. Solid-phase Fe(III) concentrations were 50 to 100 times higher, and solid sulfide concentrations were eight times lower in bioturbated, vegetated sediments (BVL) as compared to nonbioturbated, unvegetated (NUC) sediments. Integrated sulfate reduction rates were 10 times lower in BVL (2 mmol m(-2) d(-2)) as compared to NUC sediments (20 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Directly measured Fe(III) reduction rates were high at the BVL site, whereas no Fe(III) reduction was detected at NUC or in killed sediment treatments. Molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited 70% of carbon oxidation when added to NUC sediment but showed no effect on Fe(III) reduction or C oxidation in BVL sediments. Counts of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were two orders of magnitude higher in BVL sediments (10(7) cells g(-1)) in comparison to NUC sediments (10(5) cells g(-1)). Fe(III) respiration comprised up to 100% of carbon oxidation in BVL sediments, whereas sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process (greater than or equal to70% of C oxidation) at NUC. We provide strong evidence to show that macroorganisms stimulate FeRB to outcompete sulfate-reducing bacteria in saltmarsh sediments by supplying an abundance of reactive Fe(III) through reoxidation processes.

TI  - Halophyte residue decomposition and microbial community structure in coastal soil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are known for higher primary productivity and play a crucial role in carbon-sequestration, nutrient-cycling, and ecological services; however, scarce information are available on halophyte residue mineralization and microbial community structure during decomposition. Soil microcosms with residues (1% w/w) of three dominant halophytes (Aeluropus lagopoides, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Suaeda nudiflora) and one control were incubated under laboratory conditions and sampled at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 90 days to link the microbial community structure and residues decomposition in degraded coastal soil. Samples were subjected to identification of active microbial groups and residue mineralization using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and CO2 evolution methods, respectively. Biochemical composition of residues was also analyzed. Cumulative CO2 evolution was elevated in residue-amended soils compared with control, and it was highest in Arthrocnemum followed by Suaeda, Aeluropus, and control soil. The Aeluropus residue decomposed slower than others due to its high C/N ratio and low protein content. The contents of total FAME and biomarker FAMEs of microbial groups (bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetes) responded positively to the residue amendments compared with control, which indicate the improvement in soil microbial biomass. Soils amended with Suaeda had the highest amount of total (76.8 nmol/g) and fungal FAMEs (6.7 nmol/g), and bacterial (28.6 nmol/g) and actinomycete (3.0 nmol/g) FAMEs were elevated in Arthrocnemum amended soil. At the same time, soils amended with Suaeda (6.2%), Arthrocnemum (28.4%), and control (15.4%) had the greatest abundance of fungal, Gram-negative and Gram-positive FAME biomarkers, respectively. The present study suggests that residue of halophyte species affected the abundance of fungal and bacterial biomarkers, and the microbial community structure.

TI  - Stable isotope (variant delta13C) composition of the food web of the temperate Kariega estuary (Eastern Cape)
T2  - African Journal of Aquatic Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotope (variant delta13C) composition of the food web in the temperate Kariega estuary in summer and winter was analysed to determine the trophic relationships between 19 taxa. There was no seasonality in the stable isotope ratios of the dominant producers and consumers in the estuary. Two distinct zooplankton assemblages were identified. The first assemblage, comprising the different developmental stages of the copepods Acartia longipatella, A. natalensis and Pseudodiaptomus hessei and the mysid Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, had intermediate variant delta13C values ranging between -16 and -18permill. These values indicate a carbon source relatively depleted in carbon, most likely particulate organic matter derived mainly from the salt marsh and riparian vegetation. The second zooplankton assemblage, consisting of the caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi, the cumacean Iphinoe truncata and the amphipod Grandidierella lignorum, had variant delta13C values (range -9 to -12permill) enriched in carbon. The most likely sources of carbon for these zooplankters were the eelgrass Zostera capensis, its associated epiphytes and/or Spartina maritima. The isotope compositions of the seven most abundant fish species were also divided into two groups. The first group, comprising Atherina breviceps and Gilchristella aestuaria, had isotope values ranging between -14 and -15permill, suggesting that they consume mainly zooplankton. The variant delta13C values of the second group, comprising Rhabdosargus holubi, Liza richardsonii, L. dumerilii, Caffrogobius natalensis and C. gilchristi ranged between -11 and -12permill. These values suggest that these species assimilate a carbon source enriched in carbon derived either from eelgrass, Zostera capensis, its associated epiphytes or S. maritima. Results of the study suggest that there are two main carbon pathways for plankton and nekton in the Kariega estuary, carbon derived from the eelgrass and its associated epiphytes and carbon which has its origins in the salt marsh riparian vegetation and zooplankton.

TI  - No-net-loss not met for nutrient function in freshwater marshes: recommendations for wetland mitigation policies
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide many important services throughout the world, with an estimated economic value that, in comparison to other ecosystems, far exceeds their relatively small global extent. In recognition of their importance, both national and international regulations exist to protect the world's remaining wetlands. Of growing interest is the "no-net-loss'' policy which permits unavoidable destruction of wetlands if compensated by restoration of degraded wetlands or creation of new wetlands. The fundamental assumption of no-net-loss is that wetlands can be created which function equivalently to natural wetlands. One integral function that wetlands perform is cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Here we demonstrate that loss of this nutrient-related function is not being mitigated by creation or restoration of wetlands. We compare indicators of plant-and microbial-mediated functions, as well as abiotic (e. g., soil character, hydrology) and biotic (e. g., plant community composition) structure, between 10 created or restored and 5 natural freshwater depressional wetlands in central Ohio, USA. Nutrient stocks were generally smaller and transformations slower in created wetlands than in natural wetlands, with little development over time. Of particular concern were differences in C-and N-related function. Created wetlands stored 90% less C within litter and 80% less C within soil and processed 60% less N through denitrification, on average compared to natural wetlands. Our study suggests that subversion of natural wetlands into restored or created wetlands could have large-scale environmental consequences such as reduced capacity for nitrate removal and C sequestration.

TI  - Marsh accretion and sediment accumulation in a managed tidal wetland complex of Delaware Bay
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland impoundments are created to provide ecological benefits such as water quality improvement, mosquito control, and migratory bird habitat. Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, located on the southwestern shore of the Delaware Bay, is composed of four interconnected wetland management units. Tidal inflow from Delaware Bay to Units I and IV occurs naturally, whereas flow to Units II and III has been restricted by tidal gates since the mid-1980s. To assess the accretionary status of Refuge marshes and inform an ongoing restoration, we investigated soil physical properties and developed Cs-137 and Pb-210 radiochronologies for cores collected at twelve sites. Results indicate that marsh accretion is driven by a combination of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation, the relative proportions of which vary among and within the wetland units. Accretion rates (0.11-0.54 cm/y) were found to be significantly correlated with organic matter accumulation but not with mineral sediment accumulation. These relationships demonstrate that biotic contributions to marsh accretion, such as belowground biomass productivity, must be considered in marsh restoration strategies, in addition to the supply of mineral sediment. At eight of the sites, the contribution of mineral sediment to the total volume of the soils has decreased significantly since the early 1900s, predating the impoundment works, perhaps in association with closure of two tidal inlets by natural processes. By comparison, changes in organic soil volume were relatively small over the same time span. At seven of the sites the marsh is accreting at, to just below, the rate of local relative sea-level rise (0.34 +/- 0.03 cm/y) with potential for submergence on the long term. Additional research at the Refuge is needed to better align measurements of marsh accretion, relative sea-level from tide gauges, and wetland elevation change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Potential of Satellite Remote Sensing Time Series to Uncover Wetland Phenology under Unique Challenges of Tidal Setting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a 14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models, allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal distribution of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur and their ecological stoichiometry in wetland soils along a water and salt gradient in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Top soils (0-10 cm) were collected in three sampling belts during four seasons in 2014, including bare land (HN1), Calamagrostis epigeios (HN2), Typha orientalis (HN3), Phragmites australis (HN4), Tamarix chinensis (HN5) and Suaeda salsa (HN6) along a water and salinity gradient in the Yellow River Delta, China. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), total sulfur (TS) and their ecological stoichiometry were measured to investigate their seasonal and horizontal distribution patterns, as well as their important influencing factors such as electric conductivity (EC) and water content (WC). Our results showed that the contents of SOC and TN exhibited similar changing tendency along the water and salinity gradient. The TP contents followed the order HN5 approximate to HN2 > HN3 approximate to HN6 > HN4 > HN1. TS levels generally increased with increasing salinity from HN1 to HN6. The higher levels of SOC and TP were mostly observed in October and August, respectively, while the seasonal variations in TN were heterogeneous under different plant covers. TS contents were lower in August compared with other sampling periods except for HN4. The mean values of the C/N, C/P and C/S ratios along a water-salinity gradient ranged from 26 to 72, 20 to 74, and 61 to 292, respectively. Generally, higher C/P ratios were observed in sampling sites with plant covers in October expect for HN1, whereas they were lower in January or August. SOC, TN and TP were significantly positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM), silt, WC and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (p < 0.05), whereas TS showed a positive correlation with EC and cations content (p > 0.05). Bulk density (BD) had a great influence on C/N ratio, C/P ratio were mainly effected by SOM, EC and silt, while C/S ratio showed a significant negative correlation with BD, EC, K+, Na+, and Mg2+ (p < 0.05).

TI  - Effect of coastal upwelling on nitrogen regeneration from sediments and ammonium supply to the water column in Concepcion Bay, Chile
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonium regeneration was studied in sediments collected from two stations located in Concepcion Bay, Chile, a semi-enclosed and shallow system. This system is under the effects of the coastal upwelling processes for about 57% of every year. To understand the importance of the benthic system in ammonium dynamics, quantification is required of, at least, detrital inputs (with sediment traps), ammonium recycling rates (using experimental incubations of intact sediment cores), and ammonium loss through burial in the sediment column. The mean annual ammonium flux of 3.41 mmol m(-2) day(-1) is comparable to the estimated benthic flux in very high productivity areas. The sediment thus constitutes an important ammonium source for the water column with respect to other sources, such as inputs from salt marshes, rivers and shelf waters. Seasonal variation in ammonium fluxes reflects the seasonality in macrofaunal activity, detrital inputs to the sediment-water interface, and the oxygen content of bottom water. These variables are enhanced in summer and may be an effect of the upwelling process. Ammonium benthic flux measurements and calculated burial rates are utilized to estimate the nitrogen budget of the sediments in the two stations studied. Approximately 76-83% of total nitrogen is regenerated as a product of the remineralization of organic matter produced during upwelling events which settles onto anoxic sediment.

TI  - Potential use of Spartina alterniflora as forage for dairy cattle
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the potential use of halophyte Spartina alterniflora (SA) as forage for ruminants by detecting the effect of plant maturity on organic and mineral compositions as well as the effect of increasing dietary inclusion of S. alterniflora on rumen fermentation in dairy cattle. Crude protein (CP), ash content, and in vitro dry matter (DM) digestion of S. alterniflora exhibited a negative correlation with increasing maturity; however, biomass, DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content showed a positive correlation. Mineral composition drastically changed with increasing plant maturity. Compared with conventional diets, S. alterniflora mixed diets showed higher ash, NDF, ADF, ether extract, and Na, Ca, and P contents, and similar organic matter (OM), CP, and gross energy contents. DM and water intake of dairy cattle linearly increased from 0% to 25% SA in the diet. The mean values of the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA); the molar percentage of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate; and the acetate-to-propionate ratio did not significantly change at 12:00 h with increasing inclusion level of S. alterniflora in the diet. The initial findings obtained from the feed and rumen fermentation analysis of dairy cattle demonstrate that S. alterniflora can be utilized as potential forage for dairy cattle at less than 25% of the animal's diet. Overall, S. alterniflora could be provided with the potential to improve the sustainability of ruminant production as alternative feeds to replace partially common roughages, alleviate feeding cost and partially control the rapid spread of the invasive plant in salt marsh of China.

TI  - Vertical and lateral distribution of Foraminifera and Ostracoda in the East Frisian Wadden Sea - developing a transfer function for relative sea-level change
T2  - GEOLOGICA BELGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of rising sea levels and increased storm surge hazards, detailed information on relative sea-level (RSL) histories and local controlling mechanisms is required to support future projections and to better prepare for future coastal-protection challenges. This study contributes to deciphering Holocene RSL changes at the German North Sea coast in high resolution by developing a transfer function for RSL change. Recent associations of Foraminifera and Ostracoda from low intertidal to supratidal settings of the barrier island of Spiekeroog in combination with environmental parameters (granulomeny, C/N, total organic carbon, salinity) were investigated and quantified in elevation steps of 15 cm in order to generate a first transfer function (TF) of Holocene RSL change. In a future step, the TF can be applied to the stratigraphic record. Our data show a clear vertical zonation of foraminifer and ostracod taxa between the middle salt marsh and the tidal flat with very few individuals in the sand flat area, suggesting removal by the tidal current or poor preservation. Multivariate statistics identify the elevation, corresponding to the inundation frequency, as main driving factor. The smallest vertical error (49 cm) is associated with an entirely new approach of combining Foraminifera and Ostracoda for a TF. Advantages of the TF over classical RSL indicators such as basal and intercalated peats - beside the relatively narrow indicative meaning - include the possible application to a wide range of intertidal facies and that the resulting RSL curve does not depend on compaction-prone peats.

TI  - A blue carbon ecosystems qualitative assessment applying the DPSIR framework: Local perspective of global benefits and contributions
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.

TI  - New applications of the Poisson distribution in micropalaeontology: relationships between environmental variables and the Ammonia tepida distribution in the south-western Spanish estuaries
T2  - TERRA NOVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of the Poisson regression to the populations of the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida collected in three south-western Spanish estuaries permits to obtain a quantitative approach between some environmental variables and the number of individuals of this species. Although the three general models are unsatisfactory to predict the observed abundance of this micro-organism, a partial statistical analysis permits to detect quantitatively the impact of each variable. This analysis indicates an increasing abundance from the high-salt marshes to the subtidal channels and higher densities in those samples subjected to very euryhaline conditions. Increasing sand percentages show negative effects on the A. tepida abundance, whereas the silt contents do not affect significantly to this species and increasing organic carbon percentages have a small positive effect on the A. tepida densities.

TI  - FORAMINIFERA CHECK LIST AND THE MAIN SPECIES DISTRIBUTION IN THE AVEIRO LAGOON AND ADJACENT CONTINENTAL SHELF (PORTUGAL)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is based on a compilation of benthic foraminiferal data collected in the Aveiro Lagoon and in the adjacent continental shelf and upper slope (center of Portugal). It intends to provide an overall analysis from transitional to the outer continental shelf of the occurrence and distribution of species in living and to present updated taxonomic data and illustrations of most of the species found in the in the Aveiro Lagoon and in the adjacent continental shelf including in total assemblages. Correspondence analysis (CA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) interpreted as depth functions allow us to identify the main species in different ecoenvironments and sectors of the study area. The most unusual living assemblage was documented in the lagoon inlet under very strong tidal currents activity, composed mostly by the following species (both in living and total assemblages): Rotaliammina concava, Lepidodeuterammina ochracea, Quinqueloculina seminula, Gavelinopsis praegeri, Paratrochammina haynesi, Remaneica helgolandica and Remaneicella gonalezi. The distribution patterns of some Trochamminidae and Remaneicidae species whose ecology and distribution pattern are poorly known, have proved to be a marker of more or less hydrodynamic and stable/unstable environments in coastal and transitional marine environments.

TI  - LANDSCAPES AND SOILS OF NORTH SEA BARRIER ISLANDS: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OLD WEST AND YOUNG EAST OF SPIEKEROOG ISLAND (GERMANY)
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - To get further insights into the development of landscape elements and soils of North Sea barrier islands; an old part in the West (formed between approx. 1650-1860) and a young part, largely unaffected by anthropogenic influences in the East (formed approx. 1960), of the island Spiekeroog were comparatively analyzed. Between the two parts beach soils (World Reference Base of Soil Resources (WRB), IWG WRB (2015): Eutric Huvic Tiadalic and Eutric Endosalic Arenosols; German Soil Classification System (GSCS), AD-Hoc-AG BODEN (2005): Nassstrand and Strand) did not differ, except for microbial mats, which were found only in the East. In the West, a dune complex comprising white, gray and brown dunes holds a soil chronosequence from unaltered sands (WRB: Eutric Protic Arenosol; GSCS: Lockersyrosem) to braunified and podzolized soils (With: Dystric Brunk Arenosol; GSCS: Braunerde). However, in the East, only a single white dune chain, with adjacent shallow dune mounds to the south, had formed. In both parts, dune slacks evinced remarkably rapid peat formation (WRB: Dystric Histic and Eutric Histic Gleysols; GSCS: Niedermoorgleye). Here, iron content of groundwaters determined the formation of redoximorphic features. Soils of the salt marshes (WRB: Eutric Fluvic and Eutric Gleysols; GSCS: Rohmarschen) showed the highest contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the West, where the thickest fine sediment layers were also found. Revealed shortcomings of the German soil classification system concerning the classification of 'Strand' and 'Rohmarsch' soils are discussed. It is suggested to exclude the obligatory carbonate (CaCO3) content in the definition of the Strand soil and to introduce an additional horizon prefix to indicate carbonate contents between > 0 and < 2%, in order to classify Rohmarsch soils, with primary carbonate contents < 2%. Finally, an outlook on the future landscape -and soil development is provided, which is expected to be most profound in the young East.

TI  - Holocene palaeoenvironmental history of the Amazonian mangrove belt
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland dynamic in the northern Brazilian Amazon region during the Holocene was reviewed using palynological, carbon and nitrogen isotopes records, and C/N ratio previously published. The integration of 72 radiocarbon dates recorded in 34 sediment cores sampled along the marine and fluvial littoral, and mainly influenced by the Amazon River, reveals that marine influence and mangrove vegetation were wider than today on the mouth of Amazon River between >8990-8690 and 2300-2230 cal yr BP, forming a continuous mangrove belt along the northern Brazilian Amazon littoral. The establishment of this mangrove strip is a direct consequence of the marine incursion caused by post-glacial sea-level rise possibly associated with tectonic subsidence during the Early and Middle Holocene. In the Late Holocene, in areas influenced by the Amazon River discharge, the mangroves were replaced by freshwater vegetation, and the coast morphology evolved from an estuarine dominated into a rectilinear coast due to coastal progradation. Nevertheless, the marine-influenced littoral, which is currently dominated by mangroves and salt-marsh vegetation, has persistently had brackish water vegetation over tidal mud flats throughout the entire Holocene. Likely, the fragmentation of this continuous mangrove line during the Late Holocene was caused by the increase of river freshwater discharge associated to the change from dry into wet climates in the Late Holocene. This caused a significant decrease of tidal water salinity in areas near the mouth of Amazon River. These changes in the Amazon discharge are probably associated with dry and wet periods in the northern Amazon region during the Holocene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estuary hydrogeomorphology affects carbon sources supporting aquatic consumers within and among ecological guilds
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of carbon sources supporting aquatic food webs within and among estuaries may be influenced by factors that affect relative availability of autotrophic carbon sources, as well as movement of individuals among marine, estuarine and freshwater zones. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine (1) the relative importance of carbon sources supporting estuarine consumers among estuaries with different hydrogeomorphic characteristics, (2) stable isotope signatures of consumer ecological guilds defined by dependence on estuarine habitats and residence time, and (3) if patterns in stable isotope signatures of ecological guilds repeat across estuaries with distinct hydrogeomorphological features. At the assemblage level, consumer carbon isotope signatures reflected the consumption of locally abundant primary production sources and differed across estuary types (choked lagoon, coastal river). Consumer ecological guilds differed in delta C-13 within sites, and the same trend repeated across sites but with differing magnitudes. This variation is attributed to movement and residence patterns in addition to differences in the relative abundances of autotrophic sources across sites. Although within-estuary variation in consumer resource use is to be expected, estuarine food webs may be broadly classified according to landscape-scale hydrogeomorphic factors that allow an initial prediction of the relative importance of carbon sources to secondary production. Predictions may be refined at the species level using knowledge of habitat use and residence time. Such predictions are useful as a starting point for poorly studied regions such as ours in southern Brazil, as well as for global-scale analyses of patterns in estuarine food webs.

TI  - Anthropogenic Effects on Fluxes of Ecosystem Respiration and Methane in the Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the influence of human activities on ecosystem respiration (CO2) and CH4 fluxes and determine the seasonal and spatial variations, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes at four sampling sites (west side of the seawall, WSS; oilfield, OF; Spartina alterniflora coastal marsh, SCM; aquaculture pond, ACP) in the Yellow River estuary from June to December in 2013. Both CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed seasonal and spatial variations in the Yellow River estuary. The average CO2 fluxes from WSS, OF, SCM and ACP were 125.36, 111.03, 241.97 and -39.49 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), while CH4 fluxes were -0.0110, -0.0165, 0.2012 and 0.0034 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Spatial variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by vegetation and soil moisture. There were significant relationships between both CO2 fluxes in WSS and SCM and CH4 flux in SCM with temperature. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors in OF and ACP. Human activities have great effect on greenhouse gas emission, especially in the area where exotic-species S. alterniflora invaded. The construction of seawall blocked sea water transporting into the study area leading to low soil moisture which accelerated CO2 emission. Aquaculture ponds act as an emission of CH4 and consumption of CO2.

TI  - Perceptions of the seagrass ecosystems for the local communities of Eastern Samar, Philippines: Preliminary results and prospects of blue carbon services
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal communities, knowingly or otherwise, rely on seagrasses for their livelihood, recreation and food source, among other services. However, despite its importance, seagrasses are not receiving similar attentions with its adjacent ecosystems, the mangroves, and coral reefs. Because of their role in climate change mitigation, seagrasses along with mangroves and salt marshes (the blue carbon ecosystems) are gaining attention recently. This preliminary study investigates the perception of coastal communities in Eastern Samar, Philippines on seagrasses. The results of the survey show that there is a level of high awareness among respondents to seagrass ecosystem services. Despite that, however, utilization remains low. The level of awareness varies on the type of ecosystem service; for instance, locals have a high awareness of provisioning services while low awareness of cultural services. The survey also included the perceived threats to seagrasses, where damages caused by natural disturbances are identified as the most concerning threat. This may be due to the geographic location of the sites that are frequented by typhoons. The perception potentially indicates depleted resources brought about by mismanagement or overlooking this natural resource. The results provide a more contextualized understanding on how local communities are aware of and interacting with, or the lack thereof, seagrass ecosystems. This could aid local government units (LGUs) and conservation groups in the area to craft practicable and sustainable management plans and threat-specific solutions.

T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the fates of nutrients entering the Rhode River estuary from its watershed and from atmospheric deposition.  Production or consumption of materials in the upper estuary was calculated from a mixing model with chloride as a conservative tracer.  The upper estuary produced chlorophyll and dissolved PO4(3-) (DPO4(3-)) but consumed particulate PO4(3-) (PPO4(3-)), total inorganic N, dissolved organic N, and particulate organic C.  These net fluxes were influenced more by shallow, open-water areas than by the tidal marshes which cover two-thirds of the area of the upper estuary.  Ratios of chlorophyll to organic C, N, and P suggest that most of the suspended particulate organic matter in the upper estuary was produced by phytoplankton rather than derived from watershed inputs.  The consumption of nitrate due to phytoplankton production and the production of DPO4(3-) due to release from particulate P after deposition in sediments resulted in low inorganic N:P ratios, contrasting sharply with the lower estuary and adjacent Chesapeake Bay.  Dissolved inorganic N and P entered the upper estuary from the watershed at an atomic ratio of 26 but left the upper estuary at a ratio of 2.7.  The release of DPO4(3-) from watershed-derived sediments may be a common feature among estuaries and could promote N limitation of primary production in estuarine and coastal waters.

TI  - Carry-over of differential salt tolerance in plants grown from dimorphic seeds of Suaeda splendens
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims Halophytic species often show seed dimorphism, where seed morphs produced by a single individual may differ in germination characteristics. Particular morphs are adapted to different windows of opportunity for germination in the seasonally fluctuating and heterogeneous salt-marsh environment. The possibility that plants derived from the two morphs may also differ physiologically has not been investigated previously.Methods Experiments were designed to investigate the germination characteristics of black and brown seed morphs of Suaeda splendens, an annual, C-4 shrub of non-tidal, saline steppes. The resulting seedlings were transferred to hydroponic culture to investigate their growth and photosynthetic (PSII photochemistry and gas exchange) responses to salinity.Key Results Black seeds germinated at low salinity but were particularly sensitive to increasing salt concentrations, and strongly inhibited by light. Brown seeds were unaffected by light, able to germinate at higher salinities and generally germinated more rapidly. Ungerminated black seeds maintained viability for longer than brown ones, particularly at high salinity. Seedlings derived from both seed morphs grew well at high salinity (400 mol m(-3) NaCl). However, seedlings derived from brown seeds performed poorly at low salinity, as reflected in relative growth rate, numbers of branches produced, F-v/F-m and net rate of CO2 assimilation.Conclusions The seeds most likely to germinate at high salinity in the Mediterranean summer (brown ones) retain a requirement for higher salinity as seedlings that might be of adaptive value. On the other hand, black seeds, which are likely to delay germination until lower salinity prevails, produce seedlings that are less sensitive to salinity. It is not clear why performance at low salinity, later in the life cycle, might have been sacrificed by the brown seeds, to achieve higher fitness at the germination stage under high salinity. Analyses of adaptive syndromes associated with seed dimorphism may need to take account of differences over the entire life cycle, rather than just at the germination stage.

TI  - Floods and Cold Front Passages: Impacts on Coastal Marshes in a River Diversion Setting (Wax Lake Delta Area, Louisiana)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Diversion of the Mississippi River is considered the most effective way of offsetting Louisiana's coastal plain land loss. The Wax Lake delta, a man-made diversion that represents mostly sand-rich distributary mouth bar deposits, is cited as a model for land building from a large river diversion. The fine-grained suspended load is mostly deposited outside of "the delta." Numerical simulations of diversion delta building focus primarily on sand deposition. The fine-grained suspended load is only secondarily considered. Research results reported here suggest that natural processes associated with the synergistic relationship between floods and cold front passages can effectively distribute suspended sediments to maintain and rebuild wetlands outside the sand-rich delta. Measurements (fixed acoustic Doppler current profilers) of current speed, current direction, and water level in a mainland marsh channel, north of Atchafalaya Bay, indicate that as cold fronts approach, local water levels can be elevated by as much as 1 m, and normal discharge into the bay is reversed so that flow is into the coastal plain marshes. LIDAR bank elevations indicate that overbank flow is initiated by these events. Streamside sediment accretion (2-y monitoring period) using feldspar plots indicates up to 6.8 cm. Longer term Cs-137 data reveal an average sediment accretion rate of >1 cm y(-1) over 50+ years. Marsh flooding results in denitrification of nitrate in river water plus nutrient uptake resulting in increased plant productivity, considerably greater than for similar coastal plain marshes free of riverine sediment input. Fine-grained suspended sediments are important for rebuilding Louisiana's coastal plain, which is naturally constructed mostly of riverine silt and clay plus organic matter.

TI  - Denitrification potential and its correlation to physico-chemical and biological characteristics of saline wetland soils in semi-arid regions
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Denitrification is an important pathway of NO removal depending on wetland soil characteristics. Most studies on denitrification have been conducted in the freshwater wetlands and coastal marshes, but little information is available on how soil and environmental factors affect denitrification of saline wetlands in semi-arid regions. We conducted a correlative study on denitrification potential in relation to the physicochemical and biological characteristics. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from different halophyte communities along a saline-impact gradient around Wuliangsuhai Lake, i.e. Comm. Salicornia europaea (CSE), Comm. Suaeda glauca (CSG), Comm. Kalidium foliatum (CKF) and Comm. Sophora alopecuroides (CSA). The CSA soil profile showed the fastest denitrification kinetics and tended to yield the largest amount of N2O, followed by the CKF, CSG and CSE. The mean of potential denitrification rates was the highest across all depths of the CSA soil profile, followed by the CKF. CSG, and CSE. Principal component analysis indicated that exchangeable sodium percentage was a key factor to denitrification potential, apart from organic carbon, nitrate and denitrifying bacteria. The results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of salined wetlands for treating nutrient-rich return water from farmland, industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in the diverted trunk drain used for the lakeshore restoration.

TI  - Mangrove and Saltmarsh Distribution Mapping and Land Cover Change Assessment for South-Eastern Australia from 1991 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems, such as saltmarsh and mangroves, provide a wide range of important ecological and socio-economic services. A good understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of these ecosystems is critical to maximising the benefits from restoration and conservation projects. We mapped mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystem transitions from 1991 to 2015 in south-eastern Australia, using remotely sensed Landsat data and a Random Forest classification. Our classification results were improved by the addition of two physical variables (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), and Distance to Water). We also provide evidence that the addition of post-classification, spatial and temporal, filters improve overall accuracy of coastal wetlands detection by up to 16%. Mangrove and saltmarsh maps produced in this study had an overall User Accuracy of 0.82-0.95 and 0.81-0.87 and an overall Producer Accuracy of 0.71-0.88 and 0.24-0.87 for mangrove and saltmarsh, respectively. We found that mangrove ecosystems in south-eastern Australia have lost an area of 1148 ha (7.6%), whilst saltmarsh experienced an overall increase in coverage of 4157 ha (20.3%) over this 24-year period. The maps developed in this study allow local managers to quantify persistence, gains, and losses of coastal wetlands in south-eastern Australia.

TI  - Is ecosystem size more important than locality in determining the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds?
T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem size plays a key role in determining ecosystem functioning, affecting community stability and structure at both trophic and taxonomic levels. However, less is known about the influence of ecosystem size on environmental characteristics; for example, do larger ecosystems have higher nutrient availability? The nature of this relationship is important for gaining a better understanding of whether the effects of ecosystem size on community functioning are direct or indirect. Indirect effects may exist when the environmental characteristics of larger ecosystems are different from those of smaller ones, and thus the different functioning of communities observed along the ecosystem-size gradient may respond to, for instance, different levels of nutrient availability, and not uniquely to different ecosystem sizes. Here, we tested whether the environmental characteristics (i.e., the physical, chemical and biological characteristics) of temporary ponds of various sizes differed. We chose temporary ponds because they are abiotic controlled systems in which abiotic factors have a strong influence on aquatic communities. However, temporary ponds are usually spatially clustered; consequently, pond locality might also be important in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond (i.e., ponds close to one another may share similar features). We therefore examined whether pond locality is a more important factor than size in determining the environmental characteristics of a pond. To do so, we sampled environmental characteristics (chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, macrophyte biomass, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and total organic and inorganic carbon) of ponds in 5 different localities. A cluster of ponds (10 to 12) was sampled in each locality. Ponds encompassing a wide range of sizes were selected for sampling within each locality. We also performed a meta-analysis (including data from 27 temporary pond localities) to investigate whether the environmental characteristics of the ponds sampled in this study were representative of Mediterranean temporary ponds, and thus if such characteristics could be used to distinguish between Mediterranean temporary ponds from temporary ponds located outside of the Mediterranean region. Our results showed that locality had a strong effect on the environmental characteristics of temporary ponds, whereas size had only a weak influence; only chlorophyll-a and pond depth showed a robust relationship with size, as both increased with pond size independently of locality. Moreover, our results suggest that the typology of the temporary pond (i.e., if they were mountain temporary ponds, salt marsh ponds or lowland ponds) had a larger influence on several environmental characteristics than did regional location (i.e., Mediterranean).

CP  - 2nd Meeting on Isotopes in Palaeoenvironmental Reconstruction
CL  - British Geol Survey, Nottingham, ENGLAND
AB  - Holocene reconstructions of relative sea-level (RSL) and environmental change in the coastal zone have become progressively more numerous since the importance of assessing possible future sea-level rises has become apparent. Traditionally this has been achieved using a combination of biological and physical indicators (e.g. pollen, diatoms, foraminifera, grain size, etc.). In some circumstances, microfossils can be rare or absent from Holocene sediments and in these cases carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13)and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratios (C/N) can be used because they have the potential to provide information as to the origin of organic material preserved in coastal environments. The distinction in delta C-13 and ON of the various sources of carbon to estuarine sediments has led to its wide use as a tracer of carbon pathways and storage in estuaries. More recently these techniques have been applied to Holocene sediments to decipher changes in palaeocoastal environments and thus position relative to sea-level and/or palaeoriver discharge, which have direct relevance to palacoclimate. This paper reviews the studies that have utilised this technique and explores examples from a wide range of coastal environments (saltmarshes, estuaries, lagoons, isolation basins and fjords). It also discusses the potential alteration of geochemical signatures as a result of decompositional processes. Organic matter decomposition has been shown to change sediment delta C-13 and C/N values and thus an understanding of the processes involved is necessary in order to have confidence in the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of Holocerie delta C-13 and C/N. Decompositional shifts in UN, and particularly delta C-13, can occur over a relatively short time-period, however it is the direction of change in delta C-13 and C/N, rather than absolute values, that is key for interpreting changes in relative sea-level and thus such changes are commonly preserved.

AB  - This study aims to identify halophyte species and understand ecological characteristics of marsh plants in tidal flat using remote sensing technique. In June 2012, Nov. 2016, and Sep. 2017, satellite (Sentinel-2A) and hyper spectral (CASI-1500) images were taken and ground truth data were obtained at the same date in both years. Accuracy of classification averaged 50.3% for the satellite image and 84% for the hyper-spectral image. Mahalanobis distance classification showed the highest accuracy for the satellite image and SAM (spectral angle mapper) presented the highest accuracy for the hyperspectral image. Using SAM to extract halophyte distribution from the hyperspectral image, the size of halophyte distribution in-creased from 4,158 m2 to 66,351 m2 from 2012 to 2016. Seven species of halophyte were compared in terms of elevation and inclination angle in habitats. The highest elevation was shown in Carex pumila that prefers sandy habitat and the most inclined angle was presented in Zoysia sinica that prefers muddy habitat. Daily maximum current speed of seven species were not significantly different (p=0.99), showing that current speed and halophyte distribution were not related. This study implied the applicability of hy-perspectral image to accurate habitat mapping of halophyte in salt marsh especially in the case that field access was hard to do. Marine space data can be widely used for marine spatial planning such as tidal flat restoration, habitat management of blue carbon and submersible aquatic vegetation.

TI  - Rise and fall of mercury (Hg) pollution in sediment cores of the Thames Estuary, London, UK
T2  - EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fifty six sediment cores were collected along a 100 km longitudinal transect of the Thames estuary. Total Hg ranged from 0.01 to 12.07 mg/kg, with a mean of 2.10 mg/kg (n = 351). Concentrations of the toxic metal decreased downstream from London to the outer estuary and were positively correlated to total organic carbon (TOC) content. Many Hg profiles showed a clear rise, peak and fall, reflecting changing anthropogenic input through time. Surface concentrations averaged 1.27 mg/kg, confirming the effectiveness of recent environmental legislation and improved river management. Sediments at > 40 cm depth from London reaches of the river (Waterloo Bridge, Cuckolds Point (Rotherhithe), Butlers Wharf (Tower Bridge), Millwall, Deptford and Millennium Dome) were highly contaminated, with levels of Hg of > 7 mg/kg. The outer Thames had lower Hg, with the exception of Rainham, Crossness and Cliffe. Benchmarking against UK guidelines for the disposal of dredged material revealed that 88 samples from 21 sites exceeded the 3 mg/kg criteria (unsuitable for disposal at sea); 173 fell between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg (further assessment required); and 90 were of no concern. Using Hg as a generic pollution marker, the tidal Thames is one of the world's most contaminated river-estuarine sediment systems.

TI  - Following up on a Margalevian concept: Interactions and exchanges among adjacent parcels of coastal landscapes
T2  - SCIENTIA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Some decades ago Margalef speculated that study of the exchanges across boundaries that separate different types of ecological systems would provide significant insights about properties and processes within the units that make up ecological mosaics. Although such boundaries might be difficult to define, it seemed likely that such exchanges among units would influence the function and structure of the adjoined systems. In this paper we explore exchanges across such ecological boundaries in coastal ecosystems in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and elsewhere. We find that, indeed, definition of such boundaries is ambiguous, but study of the exchanges is more useful. In the Cape Cod system, water transport down-gradient is the dominant mechanism exerting influence on down-gradient systems. The direction of ecological control across such boundaries is largely asymmetrical, and properties of up-gradient units exert significant influence on down-gradient units. General properties of donor and receptor parcels are hard to discern, but clearly, parcels making up an ecological mosaic are not independent units, but are coupled by transfers from upgradient tesserae. Studies of controls of ecological systems need to include inter-unit influences as well as internal mechanisms.

TI  - Identifying spatial variability and complexity in wetland vegetation using an object-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation is complex in form and function. Accurately mapping the spatial variation of vegetation complexity within these ecosystems is important for identifying areas of high conservation value that provide essential ecosystem services. In this study we delineate wetland vegetation, particularly mangrove and saltmarsh, to a vegetative morphological level that identifies spatial complexity in vegetation structure. This was achieved by integrating light detection and ranging (Lidar) and aerial imagery with an object-based approach. The results demonstrate that this is an effective methodology to identify vegetation complexity, with all study sites having greater than 90% classification accuracy. These high classification accuracies were underpinned by the use of Lidar data that provide detailed structural information about vegetation that is not captured with aerial imagery. This research highlights the importance of identifying spatial variability in vegetation structure when considering the value of coastal ecosystems and the services they provide.

TI  - Quantifying Tradeoffs in Ecosystem Services Under Various Oyster Reef Restoration Designs
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Oyster populations within the coastal bays of Virginia have greatly declined, mainly due to overharvesting and disease, and past restoration efforts have largely focused on increasing their populations. Current restoration goals have now expanded to simultaneously procure the wider ecosystem services oysters can offer, including shoreline protection and ecosystem diversification. However, tradeoffs exist in designing artificial reefs because it is unlikely one design will optimize all services. This study compares the services provided by reef designs varying in elevation and width located adjacent to an intertidal marsh within a coastal bay of VA, USA. We quantified wave attenuation to determine potential coastal protection of the adjacent marsh, and changes to sediment composition and infaunal communities before and after reef construction for 3 years. After construction, we also quantified oyster size and population density to compare high and low elevation reef designs. High elevation reefs were more effective at attenuating waves and fostering oyster growth compared to low elevation reefs. Oysters atop high elevation reefs were on average approximately twice as dense and 20% larger than those on low elevation designs. Reef width had a minimal effect on oyster population density; densities on high and low reefs were similar for designs with one or three rows. The presence of oyster reefs also increased infaunal diversity and sediment organic matter. Our results indicate that artificial reef design can differentially affect the services provided through restoration, and elevation is especially important to consider when designing for oyster population enhancement and coastal protection.

M3  - Data set
AB  - Stable isotopes of primary producers will be compared to stable isotopes of functional groups of organisms at primarily three sites within the estuary that have different dominant sources of organic matter.The three sites are: Lower (IBYC, SO-3, mouth of Plum Island Sound, 2-3 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary), Middle (OTL, PR-10.1, upper Sound, lower Parker, 8-11 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary) and Upper (P2, PR-21.9, upper Parker, above Middle Rd Bridge (22 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary). The Lower site is dominated by marine phytoplankton, the Middle site is dominated by a mixture of salt marsh and phytoplankton and the Upper site is dominated by oligohaline phytoplankton and fresh marsh.Ten functional groups will be sampled at each site (Surface sediment, benthic diatoms, Nereis, mummichog, ribbed mussels, POM, blue mussels, pelagic copepods (Acartia), silversides and soft shell clams (Mya). Marsh, benthic algae and phytoplankton inputs or benthic vs. pelagic pathways will be evident in the isotopic signals of these functional groups. Samples will be collected between the middle and end of August to reflect a growing season using recently produced OM. Samples of 15 - 20 individuals will be pooled for analysis. Some silverside samplings will have 3 different pooled samples for determination of variance. Often times the same species are not collected at each site due to habitat differences (salinity/discharge) so additional species are collected to try to accomplish task of getting functional groups collected.

T2  - Environmental Data Initiative
M3  - Data set
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large and complex mixture of compounds with source inputs that differ with location, season and environmental conditions. Here, we investigated drivers of DOM composition changes in a marsh-dominated estuary off the southeastern U.S. Monthly water samples were collected at a riverine and estuarine site from September 2015 to September 2016, and bulk, optical, and molecular analyses were conducted on samples before and after dark incubations. Results showed that river discharge was the primary driver changing the DOM composition at the mouth of the Altamaha River. For discharge higher than ~ 150 m3 s-1, DOC concentrations and the terrigenous character of the DOM increased approximately linearly with river flow. For low discharge conditions, a clear signature of salt marsh-derived compounds was observed in the river. At the head of Sapelo Sound, changes in DOM composition were primarily driven by river discharge and possibly by summer algae blooms. Microbial consumption of DOC was larger during periods of high discharge at both sites, potentially due to the higher mobilization and influx of fresh material to the system. The Georgia coast was hit by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, which resulted in a large input of carbon to the estuary. The DOC concentration was ~ 2 times higher and DOM composition was more aromatic with a stronger terrigenous signature compared to the seasonal maximum observed earlier in the year during peak river discharge conditions. This suggests that extreme events notably impact DOM quantity and quality in estuarine regions.

TI  - Export of organic matter from a coastal freshwater wetland to Lake Erie: An extension of the outwelling hypothesis
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - I tested the hypothesis that seiches in large lakes play a role similar to tides in marine system by exporting detrital carbon from coastal wetlands to adjacent open waters. The study was conducted at a wetland site located along the shore of the Lake Erie. Water samples were collected at the outlet of the marsh, during inflow and outflow events, over a 19-month period. Water isotopes were also measured in the lake and in the marsh to establish the magnitude of the mixing between the two water masses. On average, the concentrations of the outflow water samples was enriched by 7.3 mg DOC l(-1) and 3.4 mg POC l(-1)compared to the inflow water samples, while no difference observed in inorganic carbon fluxes. Organic carbon was exported during fall, winter and early spring which coincide with period of organic matter decomposition. Such a concept of outwelling is not new for marine ecosystem, but is demonstrated in this study for the first time in a large lake setting influenced by seiche events. Ultimately to understand the role that these fluxes may play in maintaining the integrity of the wetland-lake system, it will be necessary to investigate whether the detrital material exported from coastal freshwater wetlands is incorporated into the open lake foodweb.

TI  - Role of saltmarsh production in subsidizing adjacent seagrass food webs: Implications for landscape-scale restoration
T2  - FOOD WEBS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration is an increasingly employed method for rehabilitating and enhancing the ecosystem services of lost or degraded coastal habitats, such as supporting high faunal densities and biomass. In certain ecosystems, faunal densities along habitat ecotones are greater than the densities observed in either adjoining habitat, potentially due to the provision of spatial subsidies (e.g., increased food availability). We tested the hypothesis that seagrass-associated consumers immediately adjacent to a saltmarsh are the recipients of food subsidies sourced from saltmarsh primary production. The food web biomarkers we used to evaluate spatial flows of energy across estuarine habitat boundaries included the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta S-34). We collected primary producers (N = 102) including macrophytic vegetation, benthic microalgae, and epiphytes, as well as 11 key consumers (N = 190) across seagrass meadows either immediately adjacent to (N = 8) or isolated from (N = 8) saltmarsh. We also estimated particulate organic matter (POM) from filter-feeding bivalves and used literature values as proxies for detritus. These food-web biomarkers reveal that seagrass-associated consumers derived 20-23% of basal primary production from the saltmarsh, regardless of saltmarsh proximity. Seagrass sources (epiphytes and vegetation) as well as POM, likely were the dominant contributors for these consumers. This finding indicates that other mechanisms (i.e., refuge provision) might be the primary driver resulting in increased nekton density within seagrass along seagrass-saltmarsh ecotones. While a synergistic restoration of saltmarsh and seagrass habitat may have a positive effect on faunal biomass, it appears there may not be a primary food subsidy benefit to seagrass-associated consumers.

TI  - The Aichi Biodiversity Targets: achievements for marine conservation and priorities beyond 2020

M3  - Article
AB  - In 2010 the Conference of the Parties (COP) for the Convention on Biological Diversity revised and updated a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Here a group of early career researchers mentored by senior scientists, convened as part of the 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity, reflects on the accomplishments and shortfalls under four of the Aichi Targets considered highly relevant to marine conservation: target 6 (sustainable fisheries), 11 (protection measures), 15 (ecosystem restoration and resilience) and 19 (knowledge, science and technology). We conclude that although progress has been made towards the targets, these have not been fully achieved for the marine environment by the 2020 deadline. The progress made, however, lays the foundations for further work beyond 2020 to work towards the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. We identify key priorities that must be addressed to better enable marine biodiversity conservation efforts moving forward.

TI  - The effect of competition on Bacopa monnieri zonation in an temporarily open/closed tropical estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we investigated the role of competition to determine Bacopa monnieri L. Pennel (Plantaginaceae) zonation in a temporarily open/closed tropical estuary. In this estuary, B. monnieri occupies a given vertical zone in the saline stretch, where it forms dense monospecific stands, but is absent elsewhere. We transplanted turfs to areas outside of their natural occurrence in the estuary, both in the presence and absence of competition: a higher-elevation zone, a lower-elevation zone and a non-saline region. Turfs transplanted between naturally occurring stands served as controls. Turfs transplanted to the lower zone either died or became much smaller. As there was no competition under this condition, we conclude that the absence of this species from this zone is due to abiotic conditions, likely light limitation imposed by the turbid water column. Turfs transplanted to the higher zone under competition died; however, in the absence of competition, they survived. Turfs transplanted to the non-saline zone died, regardless of the presence or absence of competition, indicating an abiotic restraint. Our results indicate that the absence of B. monnieri from higher elevations is related to competitive displacement, whereas its absence from lower elevations and from non-saline areas is related to abiotic drivers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the geologic/ sedimentologic history of the marsh near Mary Hammock, a marsh island in McIntosh County, GA. During the Summer of 2009, a vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh north of Mary Hammock. In addition, tree stumps buried under the marsh were recorded, and one was extracted and analyzed, to facilitate in understanding the sedimentological history of the marsh. A GPS unit was used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites and stumps. The cores were then transported to the Georgia Southern Coastal Research Lab at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), in Savannah, GA, for analysis. The tree stump was brought back to the University of Georgia for analysis. Although there was a large degree of bioturbation in the marsh near Mary Hammock, sediment core analysis (visual inspection, X-Ray analysis, particle size analysis, and analysis of organic matter content), and stump analysis (species determination and radiocarbon dating), revealed three main facies in the marsh. The topmost layer is recent marsh. The middle layer is a sandy layer, representing the former upland surface prior to sea level rise, inundation, and marsh formation (around 5,000 to 4,000 years ago). The bottom layer is a highly compact greenish-gray clay layer. The conclusion is that the former upland surface, consisting mostly of sandy soils, was inundated due to sea level rise around 4,200 B.P. Marsh sedimentation occurred after this, depositing fine-grained sediments on top of the sandy surface (Turck and Alexander, 2013).

T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a combined field and modeling approach to estimate the potential for submergence for one rapidly deteriorating (Bayou Chitigue Marsh) and one apparently stable (Old Oyster Bayou Marsh) saltmarsh wetland in coastal Louisiana, given two eustatic sea level rise scenarios: the current rate (0.15 cm year(-1)); and the central value predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (48 cm. by the year 2100). We also used the model to determine what processes were most critical for maintaining and influencing salt marsh elevation including, mineral matter deposition, organic matter production, shallow subsidence (organic matter decomposition + primary sediment compaction), deep subsidence, and sediment pulsing events (e.g., hurricanes). Eight years of field measurements from feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables revealed that the rates of vertical accretion at the Bayou Chitigue Marsh were high (2.26 (0.09) cm yr(-1) (mean +/- SE)) because the marsh exists at the lower end of the tidal range. The rate of shallow subsidence was also high (2.04 (0.1) cm yr(-1)), resulting in little net elevation gain (0.22 (0.06) cm yr(-1)). In contrast, vertical accretion at the Old Oyster Bayou Marsh, which is 10 cm higher in elevation, was 0.48 (0.09) cm yr(-1). However, there was a net elevation gain of 0.36 (0.08) cm yr(-1) because there was no significant shallow subsidence. When these rates of elevation gain were compared to rates of relative sea level rise (deep subsidence plus eustatic sea level rise), both sites showed a net elevation deficit although the Bayou Chitigue site was subsiding at approximately twice the rate of the Old Oyster Bayou site (1.1 cm yr(-1) versus 0.49 cm yr(-1) respectively). These field data were used to modify, initialize, and calibrate a previously published wetland soil development model that simulates primary production and mineral matter deposition as feedback functions of elevation. Sensitivity analyses revealed that wetland elevation was most sensitive to changes in the rates of deep subsidence, a model forcing function that is difficult to measure in the field and for which estimates in the literature vary widely. The model also revealed that, given both the current rate of sea level rise and the central value estimate, surface elevation at both sites would fall below mean sea level over the next 100 years. Although these results were in agreement with the field study, they contradicted long term observations that the Old Oyster Bayou site has been in equilibrium with sea level for at least the past 50 years. Further simulations showed that the elevation at the Old Oyster Bayou site could keep pace with current rates of sea level rise if either a lower rate for deep subsidence was used as a forcing function, or if a periodic sediment pulsing function (e.g., from hurricanes) was programmed into the model.

TI  - pH and pCO(2) microelectrode measurements and the diffusive behavior of carbon dioxide species in coastal marine sediments
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of a polymeric membrane-based pH microelectrode and a new pCO(2) microelectrode in marine sediments is evaluated for the purpose of collecting fine-scale and undisturbed porewater profiles of carbon dioxide parameters. Both microelectrodes have a precision of 0.01-0.02 logarithmic units. A fine-scale porewater profile of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) is calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data and is in good agreement with coarse-scale TCO2 profiles measured in squeezed porewater. The measuring uncertainty for TCO2 is within 5%. The measurements of the pH microelectrode also agree in general with those of a glass mini-electrode. The mini-electrode, however, measures smaller pH changes as a result of mixing the sediments.Very low pH values (< 6.0) are measured in this salt marsh-influenced sediment and are correlated to the oxidation of Mn2+, Fe2+, and possibly, solid sulfides. Concentration profiles and fluxes of TCO2, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- are calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data. These millimeter-scale profiles demonstrate that the calculation of benthic flux of TCO2 based on porewater TCO2 profiles and on a HCO3- (or a concentration "weighted") diffusion coefficient can be erroneous. When porewater pH is very low(< 7.0) in the near-surface sediment, as is the case in many organic-rich coastal sediments, TCO2 transport is accomplished significantly through the diffusion of CO2 and can be greatly enhanced due to a sharp concentration gradient and a large diffusion coefficient of CO2.

TI  - Saltmarsh rhizosphere fungal communities vary by sediment type and dominant plant species cover in Nova Scotia, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We surveyed Spartina saltmarsh sediment rhizosphere fungal communities at three saltmarshes and two timepoints in coastal Nova Scotia. Based on ITS2 Illumina miSeq rDNA data and multivariate analysis, neither sediment zone nor collection period correlated with fungal ASV richness, but collection site did. However, Shannon diversity indicated that sediment zone played a significant role in fungal diversity. For unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance, site was the major factor driving beta-diversity, with sediment zone and collection period having smaller roles. Sediment type and saltmarsh plant species may play important roles in structuring rhizosphere fungal assemblages, here dominated by ascomycetes. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess fungal sediment communities in saltmarshes in Atlantic Canada using metabarcoding. It provides a biodiversity analysis of sediment fungi in a poorly studied but highly important ecosystem and points to their roles in nutrient cycling, blue carbon, coastal stability and coastal restoration. Our work will inform ongoing saltmarsh restoration in Atlantic Canada.

TI  - Design and Construction of an Automated Irrigation System for Simulating Saltwater Intrusion in a Tidal Freshwater Wetland
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. To simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. The system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. During low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. This system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. Porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation. This porewater manipulation led to changes in the plant community and in exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane between the marsh and atmosphere. The system has proven to be a reliable way of manipulating wetland salinity for studying changes in the physicochemical environment. With modifications, it could be used to manipulate nutrient loads, hydrology, and sediment supply in other wetland systems.

TI  - Development of Soil Properties and Nitrogen Cycling in Created Wetlands
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation wetlands are expected to compensate for the loss of structure and function of natural wetlands within 5-10 years of creation; however, the age-based trajectory of development in wetlands is unclear. This study investigates the development of coupled structural (soil properties) and functional (nitrogen cycling) attributes of created non-tidal freshwater wetlands of varying ages and natural reference wetlands to determine if created wetlands attain the water quality ecosystem service of nitrogen (N) cycling over time. Soil condition component and its constituents, gravimetric soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total N, generally increased and bulk density decreased with age of the created wetland. Nitrogen flux rates demonstrated age-related patterns, with younger created wetlands having lower rates of ammonification, nitrification, nitrogen mineralization, and denitrification potential than older created wetlands and natural reference wetlands. Results show a clear age-related trajectory in coupled soil condition and N cycle development, which is essential for water quality improvement. These findings can be used to enhance N processing in created wetlands and inform the regulatory evaluation of mitigation wetlands by identifying structural indicators of N processing performance.

TI  - Growth responses of Carex ramenskii to defoliation, salinity, and nitrogen availability: Implications for geese-ecosystem dynamics in western Alaska
T2  - ECOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta in western Alaska is the principal nesting area for several species of geese, including Pacific black brant. Grazing by geese on Carex ramenskii, one of the most abundant plant species throughout much of this region, appears to have increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was (i) to evaluate the effects of early-season defoliation and fertilization on plant growth and nutrient cycling processes within field plots of C. ramenskii over a 3-year period, and (ii) to study the interactive effects of defoliation, N availability, and salinity stress on growth, and biomass and N allocation in C. ramenskii under controlled, greenhouse conditions. Relative to control plots, clipped-fertilized plots showed significant increases in aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and leaf N concentration, resulting in significant increases in offtake biomass and offtake N during both 1991 and 1992. In the greenhouse, total production of clipped and unclipped plants did not differ, but clipped plants had significantly higher offtake biomass, and biomass and N allocation to offtake compared to unclipped plants. Both field and laboratory experiments found that rapid regrowth following defoliation was dependent on soil nutrient availability. Fertilization increased soil respiration rates each year, but tended to decrease rates of net N mineralization, indicating that the soil microbial biomass is a strong nutrient sink in this ecosystem. In addition to the direct positive effects that goose feces have on plant growth, nitrogen recycled through feces may be an important source of nitrogen contributing to salinity tolerance in C. ramenskii. Our results also suggest that the observed increase in grazing pressure on patches of C. ramenskii early in the growing season may increase forage quality and quantity within these swards, and have important implications for geese-ecosystem interactions at a time of rapid goose population increase.

TI  - Macrobenthos of Spartina foliosa (Pacific cordgrass) salt marshes in southern California: Community structure and comparison to a Pacific mudflat and a Spartina alterniflora (Atlantic smooth cordgrass) marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) of and macrofaunal community structure in sediments of five southern California Spartina foliosa marshes (San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay, Bolsa Chica Lagoon, and Anaheim Bay) were examined during October 1994. Macrofaunal densities in Pacific S. foliosa marshes (avg. 122,268 indiv. m(-2) > 300 mu m) were 3 to 10 times higher than observed in Atlantic S. alterniflora and S. anglica marshes. The macrofauna of S. foliosa marshes was composed mainly of enchytraeid, naidid, and tubificid oligochaetes (66%), with the enchytraeids dominant at all sites except Bolsa Chica Lagoon. Polychaetes, insects, and peracarid crustaceans accounted for most of the remaining fauna. Multivariate analyses indicated greatest faunal similarity between the two southernmost marshes (Mission Bay and San Diego Bay), and between Anaheim and Newport Bay marshes, with Bolsa Chica Lagoon exhibiting a distinct assemblage. There were strong positive associations of faunal abundance and composition with percent organic matter and percent open area, and negative associations with percent sand and dry weight of algae. For the vegetated marsh in Mission Bay, faunal comparisons were made with an adjacent mudflat and with a S. alterniflora marsh in North Carolina, USA. The unvegetated mudflat exhibited similar macrofaunal densities but higher species richness than the adjacent Spartina marsh. The macrofaunal assemblage of the Mission Bay S. foliosa marsh differed from that of the Atlantic S. alterniflora marsh and the Pacific mudflat in having a greater proportion of oligochaetes, especially Enchytraeidae, and fewer polychaetes. This study represents the first published description that we are aware of for macrofauna in S. foliosa vegetated marsh sediments. The findings document faunal variation among southern California embayments and suggest that differences in macrobenthic community structure occur between marsh and mudflat habitat as web as between east and west coast Spartina marshes. Observed differences may have significant implications for wetland conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - EFFECT OF SALINIZATION ON LEAF MESOSTRUCTURE AND METHODS FOR THE PRIMARY FIXATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE C-4-HALOPHYTE AELUROPUS-LITTORALIS
T2  - Biologicheskie Nauki (Moscow)
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of salinity on productivity, morphology, anatomical structure, photosynthesis and primary CO2-fixation way in C4-galophyte grass Aeluropus littoralis has been investigated in South-West Kyzylkum desert. Plants grown under condition of moist salt-marsh and weak saline clay soil have been studied. Reaction of the plants to salinity has been found to be various on the different level of organization. Productivity and morphological characteristics decrease in about 3 times,  anatomical parameters change in 1.1-1.7 times and relation of the ways of primary CO2-fixation - in 1.2-1.5 times. Salt stress causes the decrease of mesophyll cell number per unit of leaf minor decrease of their size, on the contrary the number of bundle sheath cells increases in 1.4 times at double volume reducing. Such structural changes lead to the reduction of mesophyll layer surface and increase of CO2 diffusion resistance as well as the optimum proportions of two types of plant tissues. The biochemical changes during salinity are expressed in strengthening of aspartate way share in CO2 transport, though the significance of malate way stays to be high enough.

TI  - Macrofaunal communities in the habitats of intertidal marshes along the salinity gradient of the Schelde estuary
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The macrobenthos is important in benthic remineralization processes; it represents a trophic link and is also often used as a bio-indicator in monitoring programs. Variations of the environmental parameters strongly influence the structure of the macrobenthic communities in the marshes and since macrobenthos is the most important food item for marsh-visiting fish species in the Schelde, the variation in food resources can have a strong effect on the higher trophic level. The present study deals with the variation in macrobenthic communities in different habitats of intertidal marshes along the salinity gradient and the differences between the marsh creeks and the intertidal part of the estuary. The study measured density and species richness together with the biomass, and sampled a large intertidal channel and a smaller creek within five marshes along the salinity gradient of the Schelde estuary every six weeks between May and October in 2000.The small creeks had a smaller grain size and higher organic matter content than those in the large channel although the differences in the environmental parameters did not explain the different communities in the two habitats. Marshes had distinct macrobenthic communities but the abundance of macrofauna fluctuated along the estuary without an identifiable spatial trend. In contrast, the total biomass increased towards the euhaline area due to the domination of Nereis diversicolor. Diversity showed a significant positive correlation with the salinity.Comparison of the macrofaunal communities in the marsh with those on the intertidal flats of the estuary indicated similar trends in density, biomass and diversity along the salinity gradient. The density was similar in both habitats whereas biomass was much higher in the intertidal habitats of the estuary, partly due to the higher biomass of molluscs and annelids. Diversity indices were higher in the marsh, and the freshwater area had more species than in the estuary. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) on acute and chronic toxicity of the pesticides chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos and fipronil on the meiobenthic estuarine copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents an important carbon phase in coastal environments and influences the partitioning of organic contaminants. In this study, we evaluated the role of salt-marsh sediment-derived DOM vs. DOM-free seawater on the acute and chronic toxicity of three pesticides (chlorothalonil-CHTH, chlorpyrifos-CHPY and fipronil-FIP) to the meiobenthic copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis. Acute toxicity was evaluated via standard 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50), while chronic toxicity was evaluated for 16 days using a 96-well microplate life-cycle bioassay. DOM significantly reduced (p < 0.05) acute toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to male and female copepods relative to copepods exposed in DOM-free seawater. In contrast, DOM elevated the acute toxicity of FIP to male copepods. In chronic exposures with/without DOM, CHTH and CHPY did not significantly affect copepodite-to-adult development. In these treatments, plus controls, the majority (95%) of copepodites developed into adults by 8 days. Individuals exposed to FIP in the presence of DOM showed a slower development rate than FIP individuals in DOM-free seawater. Overall, FIP exposed copepodites developed into adult copepods 4 days later than controls. CHTH, CHPY and FIP significantly reduced reproductive success by 33%, 31% and 89%, respectively. DOM, however, mitigated 30% (p=0.006) and 20% (p=0.05) of the reproductive failure attributed to CHTH and CHPY. FIP-induced reproductive failure was high (similar to 80%) in all exposures regardless of DOM presence/absence. An exponential growth model predicted that exposure to CHTH, CHPY and FIP in the absence of DOM significantly reduced (>= 38%) projected naupliar production relative to DOM-free controls. In the presence of DOM, naupliar production under CHTH and CHPY exposures was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from control projections. These results indicate that DOM generally reduced the acute and chronic toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to A. tenuiremis, while certain compound-specific pesticide (FIP): organic associations may enhance acute toxicity of FIP, particularly to male copepods.

TI  - Oxidation of Ni-Rich Mangrove Sediments after Isolation from the Sea (Dumbea Bay, New Caledonia): Fe and Ni Behavior and Environmental Implications
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Formation of Fe-sulfides in anoxic horizons of mangrove sediments makes this ecosystem a potential long-term sink for metal contaminants in the intertropical region. Increasing anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas can alter the physicochemical of mangrove sediments by modifying their redox state, affecting directly the rate of Fe-sulfides that mediate accumulation of metal contaminant. Here, we show that isolation from the sea, due to land use planning, directly modify the redox state of mangrove sediments from reducing condition to oxidizing condition, affecting the stability of Ni-accumulating Fe-sulfides. Unusual suboxic/oxic conditions are indeed observed at intermediate depths in these mangrove sediments and favor the oxidative dissolution of Ni-pyrite (Fe1-xNixS2) that initially formed under anoxic/suboxic conditions. This reaction leads to a significant release of aqueous HS-, Fe2+ and Ni2+ at the redox boundary. HS- and Fe2+ oxidize into SO42- and Fe3+ and precipitate as schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)(6)SO4), leading to acidification of the pore-waters. Meanwhile, aqueous Ni2+ is mostly leached downward in the underlying anoxic layers of the sediment where it sorbs at the surface of pyrite and/or incorporates in the structure of newly formed pyrites. These results emphasize the potential of Fe-sulfides for mitigating the impact of the oxidation of former Ni-rich mangrove sediments, as long as the anoxic conditions are preserved at depth. This assumption can be expanded to other divalent metals and should be applicable to a larger set of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - ANOMALOUS ACCUMULATION OF ACID-VOLATILE SULFIDES (AVS) IN A COASTAL MARINE SEDIMENT, SAGUENAY FJORD, CANADA
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulphate reduction usually leads to the formation and accumulation of authigenic pyrite (FeS2) in organic-rich coastal marine sediments. Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2-S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S-0, reactive iron (Fe-HCl), C-ORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1-11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (Sigma H2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong Sigma H2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.

TI  - Evaluation of attractant-baited traps/targets for mosquito management on Key Island, Florida, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-year research project was conducted on Key Island, Collier County, Florida, USA, to evaluate an innovative attractant-based mosquito management technique. In the first year, species composition, relative abundance, and spatial distribution were determined. Although 16 species were collected, the dominant species was the black salt marsh mosquito, Aedes taeniorhynchus, which was the primary pest species. Efficacy of a single line barrier, consisting of 52 carbon dioxide (200 cc/min) + octenol (ca. 4 mg/h) baited traps (1994) or insecticide (lambdacyhalothrin) impregnated shade cloth targets (1995), spaced ca. 16.5 m apart, to reduce mosquito abundance in a resort area, was evaluated on the northern end of the island. Success was evaluated by means of baited surveillance traps located on both sides of the barrier. Traps and targets performed equally well. Though not statistically significant (p > 0.05), there was a reduction in mosquito abundance in the resort area when the barrier was functional. These data indicate that with refinement this mosquito management technique may be practical in certain situations.

TI  - Leaf gas films of Spartina anglica enhance rhizome and root oxygen during tidal submergence
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas films on hydrophobic surfaces of leaves of some wetland plants can improve O2 and CO2 exchange when completely submerged during floods. Here we investigated the in situ aeration of rhizomes of cordgrass (Spartina anglica) during natural tidal submergence, with focus on the role of leaf gas films on underwater gas exchange. Underwater net photosynthesis was also studied in controlled laboratory experiments. In field experiments, O2 microelectrodes were inserted into rhizomes and pO2 measured throughout two tidal submergence events; one during daylight and one during night-time. Plants had leaf gas films intact or removed. Rhizome pO2 dropped significantly during complete submergence and most severely during night. Leaf gas films: (1) enhanced underwater photosynthesis and pO2 in rhizomes remained above 10 kPa during submergence in light; and (2) facilitated O2 entry from the water into leaves so that rhizome pO2 was about 5 kPa during darkness. This study is the first in situ demonstration of the beneficial effects of leaf gas films on internal aeration in a submerged wetland plant. Leaf gas films likely contribute to submergence tolerance of S. anglica and this feature is expected to also benefit other wetland plant species when submerged.

TI  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MOBILIZATION OF FE(III) IN MARSH SEDIMENTS
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron reduction in marine sulfitic environments may occur via a mechanism involving direct bacterial reduction with the use of hydrogen as an electron donor, direct bacterial reduction involving carbon turnover, or by indirect reduction where sulfide acts to reduce iron. In the presented experiments, the relative importance of direct and indirect mechanisms of iron reduction, and the contribution of these two mechanisms to overall carbon turnover has been evaluated in two marsh environments. Sediments collected from two Northeastern US salt marshes each having different Fe (III) histories were incubated with the addition of reactive iron (as amorphous oxyhydroxide). These sediments were either incubated alone or in conjunction with sodium molybdate. Production of both inorganic and organic pore water constituents and a calculation of net carbon production were used as measures to compare the relative importance of direct bacterial reduction and indirect bacterial reduction. Results indicate that in the environments tested, the majority of the reduced iron found results from indirect reduction mediated by hydrogen sulfide, a result of dissolution and precipitation phenomena, or is a result of direct bacterial reduction using hydrogen as an electron donor. Direct iron reduction plays a minor role in carbon turnover in these environments.

TI  - Pond excavation reduces coastal wetland carbon dioxide assimilation
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however,      anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea-level rise      threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat      disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from      the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based      image analysis of high resolution four-band imagery revealed that over      7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as      high as 290 ponds per km2. Physical disturbance from pond creation and      sediment dispersal extended to over 17% of the Bays tidal wetlands. By      tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated it took 5 years for      51% vegetation recovery, 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover      (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggest that efforts to      extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment      additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of      disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found      that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C      m-2 y-1), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation      were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C m-2 y-1,      respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to      ponds - which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide -      may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources.      Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare      ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse      mitigation function.

TI  - Sample acidification significantly alters stable isotope ratios of sulfur in aquatic plants and animals
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers of material processing in studies of both modern and historical food webs. Preparation of plant and animal material for isotope analysis routinely includes steps that remove inorganic material not normally assimilated by consumers. Whereas acidification of samples is known to assist with this for some elements (carbon), it can produce unwanted effects for others (nitrogen). Here we tested the effects of acidification on sulfur isotopes by comparing isotope ratios of paired acidified and non-acidified samples of seagrass, epiphytic algae growing on seagrass and animal consumers (3 types of crustaceans: amphipods, copepods and isopods). Acid treatment resulted in significant losses of elemental sulfur from the tissues and changes in sulfur isotope ratios of samples. The artificial depletion of the heavy sulfur isotope decreased sulfur isotope ratios by 2.6% on average, and by as much as 7.0% in individual samples. Acidification of samples prior to sulfur isotope analysis results in invalid ratios and should not be used.

TI  - Ecosystem metabolism in a temporary Mediterranean marsh (Donana National Park, SW Spain)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - metabolic balance of the open waters supporting submerged macrophytes of the Donana marsh (SW Spain) was investigated in spring, when community production is highest. The marsh community (benthic + pelagic) was net autotrophic with net community production rates averaging 0.61 g C m(-2) d(-1), and gross production rates exceeding community respiration rates by, on average, 43%. Net community production increased greatly with increasing irradiance, with the threshold irradiance for communities to become net autotrophic ranging from 42 to 255 mu E m(-2) s(-1), with net heterotrophic at lower irradiance. Examination of the contributions of the benthic and the pelagic compartments showed the pelagic compartment to be strongly heterotrophic (average P/R ratio = 0.27), indicating that the metabolism of the pelagic compartment is highly subsidised by excess organic carbon produced in the strongly autotrophic benthic compartment (average P/R = 1.58).

TI  - Phosphorus alleviation of salinity stress: effects of saltwater intrusion on an Everglades freshwater peat marsh
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses to zinc stress of an invasive cordgrass, Spartina densiflora
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina densiflora Brongn. is found in coastal marshes of southwest Spain, growing over sediments containing 100-4800 ppm Zn. A glasshouse experiment was designed to investigate the effect of Zn from 0 to 100 mmol.l(-1) on the growth and photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora, by measuring relative growth rate, leaf elongation rate, number of tillers, height of tillers, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, gas exchange and photosynthetic pigment concentrations. We also determined total ash, Zn, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus concentrations, and the C/N ratio. At 100 mmol.l(-1) Zn, S. densiflora showed a 48% biomass reduction after 1 month of treatment. Long-term effects of Zn on growth of S. densiflora consisted mainly of variations in net photosynthesis. Modification of the Zn/Mg ratio was linked to a strong decrease in RuBP carboxylase (Zn was favoured in local competition with Mg, so that the affinity of RuBisCO for CO2 decreased), oxygenase activity of RuBisCO acting as a substitute for the photosynthetic function. Also, Zn had a marked overall effect on the photochemical (PSII) apparatus and the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. However, the results indicate that S. densiflora is capable of tolerating very high and continued exposure to Zn, as this species lowers the translocation of Zn from the nutrient solution to roots and controls Zn ion transport into leaves. Therefore, S. densiflora could be useful in the phytostabilization of soils.

AB  - Stable isotopes of primary producers will be compared to stable isotopes of functional groups of organisms at primarily three sites within the estuary that have different dominant sources of organic matter.The three sites are: Lower (IBYC, SO-3, mouth of Plum Island Sound, 2-3 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary), Middle (OTL, PR-10.1, upper Sound, lower Parker, 8-11 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary) and Upper (P2, PR-21.9, upper Parker, above Middle Rd Bridge (22 km upstream of the mouth of the estuary). The Lower site is dominated by marine phytoplankton, the Middle site is dominated by a mixture of salt marsh and phytoplankton and the Upper site is dominated by oligohaline phytoplankton and fresh marsh.Ten functional groups will be sampled at each site (Surface sediment, benthic diatoms, Nereis, mummichog, ribbed mussels, POM, blue mussels, pelagic copepods (Acartia), silversides and soft shell clams (Mya). Marsh, benthic algae and phytoplankton inputs or benthic vs. pelagic pathways will be evident in the isotopic signals of these functional groups. Samples will be collected between the middle and end of August to reflect a growing season using recently produced OM. Samples of 15 - 20 individuals will be pooled for analysis. Some silverside samplings will have 3 different pooled samples for determination of variance. Often times the same species are not collected at each site due to habitat differences (salinity/discharge) so additional species are collected to try to accomplish task of getting functional groups collected.

T2  - SCIENTIA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reproductive traits of an estuarine crab, Neohelice (= Chasmagnathus) granulata (Dana 185 1), were compared between individuals living in contrasting habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh) of the same population in the brackish coastal lagoon of Mar Chiquita, Argentina. In both habitats, most measures of egg biomass decreased during embryogenesis, including total dry weight (DW) and organic matter (measured as ash-free dry weight, AFDW) per egg, the contents of ash, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (per egg and as percentage values of DW), the energy content (estimated from C; both per egg and per Dig DW), and the C/N and C/H mass ratios. Egg size, wet weight (WW), and water content (in mu g and % of WW) by contrast, increased significantly during the time of embroynic development. These parameters reached significantly higher final (near-to-hatching) values in mudflats than in saltmarshes (egg volume 0.0249 vs 0.0233 mm(3); WW 36.5 vs 28.8 mu g; water content 30.7 vs 23.2 mu g per egg or 84.2 vs 80.2% of WW, respectively). Fecundity and reproductive effort did not differ significantly between habitats. Habitat-specific differences in the water content and size of crab eggs are discussed in relation to small-scale local variation in environmental conditions.

AB  - A great diversity of organisms modify the physical structure of estuarine and coastal environments. These physical ecosystem engineers - particularly, dune and marsh plants, mangroves, seagrasses, kelps, reef-forming corals and bivalves, burrowing crustaceans, and infauna - often have substantive functional impacts over large areas and across distinct geographic regions. Here, we use a general framework for physical ecosystem engineering to illustrate how these organisms can exert control on sedimentary processes, coastal protection, and habitat availability to other organisms. We then discuss the management implications of coastal and estuarine engineering, concluding with a brief prospectus on research and management challenges.

TI  - Holocene evolution of a barrier island system, Ria Formosa, South Portugal
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Holocene evolution of the Ria Formosa barrier island system was studied through the examination of a large subsurface dataset acquired from 191 boreholes and five seismic refraction profiles. Two boreholes with total depths of 26 and 16.5 m were selected for a multi-proxy detailed laboratory analysis, including mean grain size distribution, organic matter (OM) content, color variation, shell identification, and benthic foraminifera assemblages. Selected cores are thought to be representative of the identified depositional sub-basins. Subsurface age data from 16 AMS C-14 dated samples were plotted against depth and resulted in a coherent age model of sedimentary infill. The system evolution was largely controlled by sediment availability, accommodation space, and Holocene sea level rise, first at a rapid rate of 7 mm/yr from 10 kcal yr BP to 7.25 kcal yr BP, followed by a slowdown to 1.1 mm/yr until present. A conceptual model for the origin and Holocene evolution of the Ria Formosa barrier island system implies three main steps, leading to the present system geomorphology: (1) marine flooding of incised palaeovalleys by the rapid transgression of palaeovalleys in the early Holocene; (2) development of a proto-barrier island chain perched on Pleistocene detritic headlands and steeper interfluve areas during the early to middle Holocene; and (3) full development of the barrier islands chain and enclosing of the coastal lagoon, followed by the maturation of the system with subsequent siltation and salt marsh expansion from the middle Holocene until present. The onset of barrier system formation dates back to ca. 8 kcal yr BP, predating previously proposed age.

TI  - Seston available as a food resource for the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa) in a North American, mid-Atlantic saltmarsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the composition of the <25 mum seston size fraction as a food resource potentially available to suspension feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, over an annual cycle in Canary Creek saltmarsh, Delaware Bay. There were significant seasonal variations in the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and total carbohydrate, but not cellulose. The concentration of cellulose, measured by hydrolytic cellulase enzyme assay, was relatively low (seasonal range 24 to 35 mugl(-1)) and only comprised from 3% of total carbohydrate in May 1996 to 13% in November 1995. We used the biomass of microalgae, estimated from chlorophyll a, and abundance of free-living bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates to calculate each component's equivalent carbon content. Microalgae were the most dominant carbon source (62% annually) among the four identified components (phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and cellulose) in all seasons except in August 1995 when carbon from bacteria was most abundant (55%). The annual average carbon equivalents of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and cellulose were relatively small (2 and 4%, respectively). The total concentration of POC in the seston was much greater than the carbon derived from the four identified components. The proportions that these identified components contributed to POC varied seasonally and combined only accounted for 8-24% of POC. Based on these estimates, the bulk of the POC in Canary Creek marsh was not associated with any of the four components we identified. We suggest that this uncharacterized material was some type of non-lignocellulosic, amorphous detritus of unknown utility as a food resource for ribbed mussels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Fluxes and sources of suspended organic matter in an estuarine turbidity maximum region during low discharge conditions
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water column concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were measured at three different depths in four different locations bracketing the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) along the main channel of a temperate riverine estuary (Winyah Bay, South Carolina, USA). Measurements were carried out over full tidal cycle (over 24 h). Salinity, temperature, current magnitude and direction were also monitored at the same time throughout the water column. Tidally averaged net fluxes of salt, TSS, POC and PN were calculated by combining the current measurements with the concentration data. Under the extreme low river discharge conditions that characterized the study period, net landward fluxes of salt were measured in the lower part of the study area, suggesting that the landward transport through the main channel of the estuary was probably balanced by export out through the sides. In contrast, the net fluxes of salt in the upper reaches of the study area were near zero. indicatina a closed salt balance in this part of the estuary. In contrast to salt, the net fluxes of TSS, POC and PN in the deeper parts of the water column were consistently landward at all four sites in Winyah Bay indicating the non-conservative behavior of particulate components and their active transport up the estuary in the region around the ETM.The carbon contents (%POC), carbomnitrogen ratios (org[C:N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta(13)C(POC)) of the suspended particles varied significantly with depth, location and tidal stage. Tidally averaged compositions showed a significant increase up the estuary in the %POC and org[C:N]a values of suspended particles consistent with the preferential landward transport of carbon-rich particles with higher vascular plant debris content. The combination of tidal resuspension and flooddominated flow appeared to be responsible for the hydrodynamic sorting of particles along the estuary that resulted in denser, organic-poor particles being transported landward less efficiently. The elemental and isotopic compositions indicated that vascular C-3 plants and estuarine algae were the major sources of the particulate organic matter of all the samples, without any significant contributions front salt marsh C-4 vegetation (Spartina alternWora) and/or marine phytoplankton.

TI  - The role of various dissolved organic matter forms on chlorpyrifos bioavailability to the estuarine bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is comprised of a myriad of macromolecules with specific physical and chemical properties that may influence the bioavailability of hydrophobic pesticides to animals. This study was conducted to assess the role of various forms of DOM on the uptake and bioconcentration of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHPY) to the bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria. Bivalves were exposed to DOM-free seawater (30 parts per thousand) or to seawater containing a single form of DOM. DOM forms included two filtrate fractions of natural salt-marsh sediment DOM (DOM-(< 0.45 mu m) and DOM-(< 3 kDa)); natural purified humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids; and water soluble cyclic oligosaccharides alpha and beta cyclodextrins (CD-alpha and CD-beta).In C-14-CHPY uptake and elimination experiments, juvenile bivalves were exposed to uniformly-labeled C-14-CHPY and collected at time intervals during 48 h. The remaining bivalves were transferred to C-14-CHPY-free elimination chambers with bivalve collection at time intervals over 144 h. Total uptake of C-14-CHPY by bivalves in DOM-free seawater was > 40% greater than in bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the presence of most DOM forms. These results are consistent with much faster C-14-CHPY uptake rates estimated using a simple two parameter model. After the elimination period, bivalves exposed to DOM-free seawater had C-14-CHPY body residue concentrations between 25% and 86% greater than bivalves in the presence of DOM forms. Experiments with larger bivalves showed that pulse-chase exposures with a 1.5 h exposure period to C-14-CHPY was not long enough to detect differences in C-14-CHPY tissue accumulation efficiencies across treatments. Our findings suggest that natural forms of DOM, at environmentally realistic organic carbon concentrations, reduced pesticide uptake and bioconcentration, consistent with much lower uptake rates relative to bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the absence of DOM. Interestingly, at the tested organic carbon concentrations CD-alpha and CD-beta did not reduce C-14-CHPY bioconcentration in M. mercenaria. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Isotopic constraints on the fate of petroleum residues sequestered in salt marsh sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To provide a new perspective on the fate of petroleum in the marine environment, we utilized variations in the natural abundance of radiocarbon (C-14) to detect and quantify petroleum residues that have persisted in Wild Harbor sediments, West Falmouth, MA, for more than 30 years. The 5730-yr half-life of 14C makes this isotope ideal for the detection of fossil-fuel-derived contaminants (C-14 free) within different fractions of natural organic matter (modern C-14 content) in environmental matrixes. Samples of both contaminated and uncontaminated sediments were sequentially treated, first by solvent extraction, followed by saponification, and then acid hydrolysis. Radiocarbon analysis of the sediment residues and select extracts was performed to probe for the presence of fossil fuel contaminants and/or their metabolites in different pools of sedimentary organic matter. Our results indicate that the majority of fossil carbon is solvent-extractable and has not been incorporated in the insoluble organic matter in sediment. Unextracted sediments contaminated with petroleum contain significantly less C-14 than extracted sediments, and isotope mass balance calculations suggest that up to similar to 9% of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the petroleum contaminated sediment horizons is derived from solvent-extractable petroleum. These estimates are similar to values calculated when the total quantities of oil (measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID)) are compared to TOC content (determined by elemental analysis). These results pave the way for applications of this isotopic approach to more complex environmental systems where the fate of contaminants is less certain.

TI  - Effect of the phosphogypsum amendment of saline and agricultural soils on growth, productivity and antioxidant enzyme activities of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of phosphogypsum (PG) amendment on the physiochemical proprieties of saline and agricultural soils along with the growth, productivity and antioxidant enzyme activities of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown on the amended soils under controlled conditions. Obtained results showed that the amendment of saline soil (H) by PG induced a decrease in pH as well as in electrical conductivity. However, for the non saline soil (MC), there was a decrease in pH associated with an increase in electrical conductivity. For both soils, PG amendment led to an increase in Calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na), and a decrease in potassium (K) in plant tissues. Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn) and Chromium (Cr) contents in different parts of plants increased in proportion with PG concentration in the soils. Apart from Cd, all the analyzed metals in tomato fruit were found to be below the recommended maximum allowable concentration (MAC). Our results showed that PG application, at doses not exceeding 20%, seems to be beneficial for growth, photosynthetic activity and productivity of tomato plants as well as in decreasing salinity of saline soils. In these conditions, the use of PG could be a promising project for the rehabilitation of marginalized and saline ecosystems with either ornamental or non-fruit species. For both soils, a significant accumulation of MDA in shoots was detected, reflecting cell membrane damage especially when the PG amendment reached 20%. Beyond 20 and 40% PG, tomato plants developed an enzymatic antioxidant defense system in response to salinity and heavy metal stress. However, at 80% PG, enzymes activities were significantly inhibited.

TI  - Impacts and adaptation options for estuarine vegetation in a large city
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change adaptation options for natural systems are particularly challenging in high density urban settings. We model the vulnerability of estuarine vegetation (mangroves, saltmarshes and Casuarina forest) to sea level rise in Australia's most populous city, Sydney, and conduct a detailed assessment of impacts and adaptation options for a densely urbanised estuary, the Cooks River. Our modelling demonstrates a range of opportunities for the preservation and, in some cases, expansion of estuarine vegetation area under sea-level rise, though this is largely dependent on the degree of flexibility applied in the management of existing open space. Mangrove area increases under a high sea-level rise scenario, more so than under a low sea-level rise scenario, due to opportunities for landward colonisation. However, this would require estuarine vegetation expansion and land-use conversion of recreational, industrial or private land. Sediment nourishment emerges as a potentially cost-efficient means of preserving wetlands. The mix of wetland types is likely to change without active management, with higher proportion of mangrove and substantially less saltmarsh under all scenarios. Implementation of living shorelines, as opposed to hard defensive structures, could be incentivised. This could be achieved by planning concessions, 'payment for ecosystem services' such as managing 'blue carbon' values, and zoning controls that promote visual amenity and ecological adaptation.

TI  - Physiological responses of Spartina alterniflora to varying environmental conditions in Virginia marshes
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Physiological measurements were used to investigate the dependence of photosynthesis on light, temperature, and intercellular carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the C-4 marsh grass Spartina alterniflora. Functional relationships between these environmental variables and S. alterniflora physiological responses were then used to improve C-4-leaf photosynthesis models. Field studies were conducted in monocultures of S. alterniflora in Virginia, USA. On average, S. alterniflora exhibited lower light saturation values (similar to 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than observed in other C-4 plants. Maximum carbon assimilation rates and stomatal conductance to water vapor diffusion were 36 mu mol (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) and 200 mmol (H2O) m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Analysis of assimilation-intercellular CO2 and light response relationships were used to determine Arrhenius-type temperature functions for maximum rate of carboxylation (V (cmax)), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity (V (pmax)), and maximum electron transport rate (J (max)). Maximum V (cmax) values of 105 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were observed at the leaf temperature of 311 K. Optimum V (pmax) values (80.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were observed at the foliage temperature of 308 K. The observed V (pmax) values were lower than those in other C-4 plants, whereas V (cmax) values were higher, and more representative of C-3 plants. Optimum J (max) values reached 138 mu mol (electrons) m(-2) s(-1) at the foliage temperature of 305 K. In addition, the estimated CO2 compensation points were in the range of C-3 or C-3-C-4 intermediate plants, not those typical of C-4 plants. The present results indicate the possibility of a C-3-C-4 intermediate or C-4-like photosynthetic mechanism rather than the expected C-4-biochemical pathway in S. alterniflora under field conditions. In a scenario of atmospheric warming and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, S. alterniflora will likely respond positively to both changes. Such responses will result in increased S. alterniflora productivity, which is uncharacteristic of C-4 plants.

TI  - Complex carbohydrates reduce the frequency of antagonistic interactions among bacteria degrading cellulose and xylan
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial competition for resources is common in nature but positive interactions among bacteria are also evident. We speculate that the structural complexity of substrate might play a role in mediating bacterial interactions. We tested the hypothesis that the frequency of antagonistic interactions among lignocellulolytic bacteria is reduced when complex polysaccharide is the main carbon source compared to when a simple sugar such as glucose is available. Results using all possible pairwise interactions among 35 bacteria isolated from salt marsh detritus showed that the frequency of antagonistic interactions was significantly lower on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-xylan medium (7.8%) than on glucose medium (15.5%). The two interaction networks were also different in their structures. Although 75 antagonistic interactions occurred on both media, there were 115 that occurred only on glucose and 20 only on CMC-xylan, indicating that some antagonistic interactions were substrate specific. We also found that the frequency of antagonism differed among phylogenetic groups. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacillus sp. were the most antagonistic and they tended to antagonize Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, the most susceptible groups. Results from the study suggest that substrate complexity affects how bacteria interact and that bacterial interactions in a community are dynamic as nutrient conditions change.

TI  - Enhanced invertebrate prey production following estuarine restoration supports foraging for multiple species of juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.)
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries provide crucial foraging resources and nursery habitat for threatened populations of anadromous salmon. As such, there has been a global undertaking to restore habitat and tidal processes in modified estuaries. The foraging capacity of these ecosystems to support various species of out-migrating juvenile salmon can be quantified by monitoring benthic, terrestrial, and pelagic invertebrate prey communities. Here, we present notable trends in the availability of invertebrate prey at several sites within a restoring large river delta in Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A. Three years after the system was returned to tidal influence, we observed substantial additions to amphipod, copepod, and cumacean abundances in newly accessible marsh channels (from 0 to roughly 5,000-75,000 individuals/m(2)). In the restoration area, terrestrial invertebrate colonization was dependent upon vegetative cover, with dipteran and hymenopteran biomass increasing 3-fold between 1 and 3 years post-restoration. While the overall biodiversity within the restoration area was lower than in the reference marsh, estimated biomass was comparable to or greater than that found within the other study sites. This additional prey biomass likely provided foraging benefits for juvenile Chinook, chum, and coho salmon. Primary physical drivers differed for benthic, terrestrial, and pelagic invertebrates, and these invertebrate communities are expected to respond differentially depending on organic matter exchange and vegetative colonization. Restoring estuaries may take decades to meet certain success criteria, but our study demonstrates rapid enhancements in foraging resources understood to be used for estuary-dependent wildlife.

TI  - Concentrations of trace elements and iron in the Arctic soils of Belyi Island (the Kara Sea, Russia): patterns of variation across landscapes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentrations of several trace elements and iron were determined in 26 soil samples from Belyi Island in the Kara Sea (West Siberian sector of Russian Arctic). The major types of soils predominating in the soil cover were sampled. The concentrations of trace elements (mg kg(-1)) varied within the following ranges: 119-561 for Mn, 9.5-126 for Zn, 0.082-2.5 for Cd, <0.5-19.2 for Cu, <0.5-132 for Pb, 0.011-0.081 for Hg, <0.5-10.3 for Co, and 7.6-108 for Cr; the concentration of Fe varied from 3943 to 37,899 mg kg-1. The impact of particular soil properties (pH, carbon and nitrogen contents, particle-size distribution) on metal concentrations was analyzed by the methods of correlation, cluster, and factor analyses. The correlation analysis showed that metal concentrations are negatively correlated with the sand content and positively correlated with the contents of silt and clay fractions. The cluster analysis allowed separation of the soils into three clusters. Cluster I included the soils with the high organic matter content formed under conditions of poor drainage; cluster II, the low-humus sandy soils of the divides and slopes; and cluster III, saline soils of coastal marshes. It was concluded that the geomorphic position largely controls the soil properties. The obtained data were compared with data on metal concentrations in other regions of the Russian Arctic. In general, the concentrations of trace elements in the studied soils were within the ranges typical of the background Arctic territories. However, some soils of Belyi Island contained elevated concentrations of Pb and Cd.

TI  - Global-change effects on early-stage decomposition processes in tidal wetlands - implications from a global survey using standardized litter
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, are hotspots for carbon sequestration. The preservation of organic matter (OM) is a critical process by which tidal wetlands exert influence over the global carbon cycle and at the same time gain elevation to keep pace with sealevel rise (SLR). The present study assessed the effects of temperature and relative sea level on the decomposition rate and stabilization of OM in tidal wetlands worldwide, utilizing commercially available standardized litter. While effects on decomposition rate per se were minor, we show strong negative effects of temperature and relative sea level on stabilization, as based on the fraction of labile, rapidly hydrolyzable OM that becomes stabilized during deployment. Across study sites, OM stabilization was 29 % lower in low, more frequently flooded vs. high, less frequently flooded zones. Stabilization declined by similar to 75% over the studied temperature gradient from 10.9 to 28.5 degrees C. Additionally, data from the Plum Island long-term ecological research site in Mas- sachusetts, USA, show a pronounced reduction in OM stabilization by > 70 % in response to simulated coastal eutrophication, confirming the potentially high sensitivity of OM stabilization to global change. We therefore provide evidence that rising temperature, accelerated SLR, and coastal eutrophication may decrease the future capacity of tidal wetlands to sequester carbon by affecting the initial transformations of recent OM inputs to soil OM.

AB  - Orthophosphate concentrations in the Swartkops estuary mouth were determined during the first spring and neap tides of twelve successive lunar months.  The volume of water entering or leaving the estuary during the ebb and flood phases of the tide was derived using a one-dimensional numerical model.  By integrating the flow of water and the phosphate concentration, the flux of phosphate could be determined.  Seasonal, tidal and phase-of-tide differences in flux were found, but generally there was a net export of phosphate during both spring and neap tides, yielding an annual net export of 24.4 tonnes.

TI  - Distribution Patterns of Heavy Metals in Surficial Sediment and Their Influence on the Environment Quality of the Intertidal Flat of Luoyuan Bay, Fujian Coast
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal flats represent a typical environmentally fragile and sensitive zone. In order to investigate the environmental quality of the intertidal zone in Luoyuan Bay, field survey was carried out in 2009. Contents of heavy metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) in the surficial sediment were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Moreover, the impact on the environment quality was evaluated with the potential ecological risk method. The average contents of the heavy metals Co,Cr,Cu,Ni,Pb, V and Zn in the surficial sediment were 20.48, 77.82, 23.24, 40.67, 36.25, 134.75 and 111.21 mg.kg(-1) respectively. The heavy metal contents in the Spartina alterniflora salt-marsh were apparently higher than those in the bare flat. Further, the heavy metal concentrations found in the present study were generally higher than the background values of the coastal regions of Fujian Province, but lower than those associated with the Pearl River estuary. According to principal component and correlation analyses, industrial wastewater, mineral exploration and degradation of organic matter were the main sources of heavy metals in the area investigated. The results of potential ecological risk evaluation indicated that the intertidal zone as a whole can be ranked as "moderate potential ecological risk". Ni and Co were the major pollutants among the metals in consideration; the pollution related to Pb was less significant. The level of potential ecological risk of the Spartina alterniflora slat-marsh was higher than that of the bare flat. The sequence of potential ecological risk for the heavy metals was Ni > Co > Cu > Pb > Cr > V > Zn.

Significant amounts of OM and high temperatures promote activity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the mangrove waters and sediments. Rates of dark fixation in a water column reach 25.0 +/- 2.5-mu-g C/(liter. day) and 3.0-8.74 mg C/(kg.day) in sediments. Proteolytic bacteria are active in OM destruction; they mineralize 161.4-227 mg protein in 1 kg sediment per day. Cellulolytic bacteria decompose 3.5-9.1 mg C/(kg.day). For reducing sulfates, 4.08-92.0 mg C is expended and for synthesis of CH4, 0.01-0.03 mg C.

AB  - Evaluating the effectiveness and success of coastal marine habitat restoration is often highly challenging and can vary substantially between different habitat types. The current article presents a state-of-the-art review of habitat-level restoration in the coastal marine environment. It sets out most successful techniques across habitats and suggestions of better metrics to assess their success. Improvements in restoration approach are outlined, with a particular focus on selective breeding, using recent advancements in genetics. Furthermore, the assessment of ecosystem services, as a metric to determine restoration success on a spatiotemporal scale, is addressed in this article. As the concept of ecosystem services is more tangible for a nonscientific audience, evaluating restoration success in this manner has the potential to greatly contribute to raising awareness of environmental issues and to implement socioeconomic policies. Moreover, habitat-based restoration has been proven to be an effective tool to address the issue of ecosystem service sustainability and poverty alleviation. Appropriate conservation management, prior to the implementation of restoration activities, is crucial to create an environment in which restoration efforts are likely to succeed.

TI  - SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN TERRESTRIALLY-DERIVED ORGANIC-MATTER FROM SEDIMENTS OF THE DELAWARE ESTUARY
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrially-derived organic matter in sediments of the Delaware Estuary originates from riverine transport of soils and fresh litter, sewage and industrial wastes, and marsh export of organic matter.  The quantity, composition, and spatial distribution of terrigenous organic matter in sediments was determined by elemental (C and N), lignin, and stable carbon isotope analyses.  Sediments in the upper Delaware Estuary had low organic carbon content and high lignin content.  In contrast, sediments in the lower Delaware Estuary had high organic carbon content and low lignin content.  There was a slight decrease in the proportion of syringyl and cinnamyl phenols relative to vanillyl phenols between the upper estuary and lower estuary.  Differences in lignin and stable carbon isotope compositions between sediments of the Delaware Estuary and sediments of the Broadkill River estuary (an adjoining salt-marsh estuary) supported previous observations that marshes do not export substantial quantities of organic matter to estuaries.  Additional results suggested that lignin-rich sediments were concentrated in the upper estuary, most likely in the zone of high turbidity.  Furthermore, algal material diluted lignin-rich sediments, particularly in the lower estuary.  The weaker algal signal in bottom sediments compared to that in suspended particulate matter suggested algal material was decomposed either in the water column or at the sediment-water interface.  Physical sorting of sediments prior to deposition was also indicated by observations of compositional differences between the upper and lower estuary bottom sediments.  Finally, seasonal variations in primary productivity strongly influenced the relative abundance of terrestrial organic matter.  In fall, however, the proportion of lignin was greatest because of a combination of greater inputs of terrestrially-derived organic matter, lower river discharge, and a decrease in algal biomass.

TI  - Methane emissions from created and restored freshwater and brackish marshes in southwest Florida, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from newly created and restored wetlands so that we learn how to design them to minimize these emissions. Spatial and temporal patterns of methane emissions were measured in three wetland marsh complexes in southwest Florida: a created freshwater marsh on a university campus, a restored brackish/salt marsh on the fringe of a mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) coastal swamp; and a natural freshwater marsh adjacent to a cypress (Taxodium distichum) strand. Non steady -state rigid chambers were used twice a day (morning and afternoon) on a monthly schedule for 13 months. The mean +/- standard error (median) of methane emissions from permanently and intermittently flooded areas were 124 +/- 47 (0) and 0.8 +/- 0.7 (0) g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the created freshwater marsh, and 58 +/- 14 (9.4) and 0.1 +/- 0.3 (0) g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the restored brackish marsh. Methane missions were 0.8 +/- 0.5 (0) g-CH4-C M-2 y(-1) in the intermittently flooded natural freshwater marsh that served as our control. In general, average methane emissions were higher from permanently than intermittently flooding areas (P<0.05); our data suggested that ebullition may have occurred in permanently flooding areas and caused up to 6.3 g-CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in pulses in the created marsh and 1.7 g-CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in the restored marsh. Removing ebullition outliers, methane emission estimates decreased by onefourth to one-half the annual rates given above to 30 g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in permanent created freshwater marshes and 27 g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the restored brackish marshes. There were no significant differences in methane emissions from created, restored or natural marshes in intermittently flooding areas (P > 0.05). CH4 emissions exhibited strong quadratic and linear relationships with water depth when all sites were compared (P< 0.05), but no significant relationships with soil temperature or salinity. These results give useful information on ways to minimize methane emissions when creating and restoring wetlands. But these results should be only one of the considerations for wetland design as other ecosystem services should also be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to understand biogeochemical cycles of organic carbon in the permeable intertidal sandy sediments of the Nakdong estuary, we estimated the organic carbon production and consumption rates both in situ and in the laboratory. The Chl-a content of the sediment and the nutrient concentrations in below surface pore water in the sandy sediment were lower than in the muddy sediment. The sediment oxygen consumption rates were relatively high, especially when compared with rates reported from other coastal muddy sediments with higher organic carbon contents. This implied that both the organic carbon degradation and material transport in the sandy sediment were enhanced by advection-related process. The simple mass balance estimation of organic carbon fluxes showed that the major sources of carbon in the sediment would originate from benthic microalgae and detrital organic carbon derived from salt marsh. The daily natural biocatalzed filtration, extrapolated from filtration rates and the total area of the Nakdong estuary, was one order higher than the maximum capability of sewage plants in Busan metropolitan city. This implies that the sandy sediment contributes greatly to biogeochemical purification in the area, and is important for the re-distribution of materials in the coastal environment.

TI  - Root iron plaque abundance as an indicator of carbon decomposition rates in a tidal freshwater wetland in response to salinity and flooding
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise is projected to influence soil carbon (C) stocks in tidal wetland systems. Although soil C and iron cycling are considered to be related in tidal wetlands, the empirical link between root ferric iron [Fe(III)] plaque formation and C decomposition in response to salinity and flooding is scarcely known. Here, we established mesocosms loaded with soils from a tidal freshwater wetland and subjected to three salinity treatments (fresh control, oligohaline, mesohaline) plus three flooding (i.e., flooding water-level height) treatments. Root Fe(III) plaque abundance, C-degrading enzyme activities, and potential C mineralization rates (CMRs) and microbial Fe (III) reduction rates (FeRRs) were simultaneously quantified. The oligohaline treatment elevated root Fe(III) plaque abundance relative to fresh control, while the mesohaline treatment suppressed it. Owing to high abundance of root Fe(III) plaque, microbial Fe(III) reduction predominated C mineralization in the oligohaline treatment (56 +/- 7%). However, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction decreased by up to 25 +/- 5% in the mesohaline treatment due to inhibition by salinity. The potential CMRs increased by 17% from fresh control to oligohaline treatment, but declined by 27% from fresh control to mesohaline treatment. The potential CMRs were affected by potential FeRRs and C-degrading enzyme activities. The latter two were associated with root Fe (III) plaque abundance. These results together showed that root Fe(III) plaque abundance was linked to potential CMRs in response to salinity. Flooding did not affect root Fe(III) plaque abundance and had much less of an effect on potential CMRs compared to salinity. Altogether, root Fe(III) plaque abundance could be as an indicator of C decomposition rates in tidal freshwater wetland soils in response to salinity and flooding. Future C decomposition prediction models under sea-level rise could embed root Fe(III) plaque abundance as an indicator for integrating plant-microbe-soil interaction into models.

TI  - A comparative investigation of the effects of south Louisiana crude oil on the vegetation of fresh, brackish and salt marshes
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of south Louisiana crude oil on the dominant vegetation, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens and Sagittaria lancifolia, of three types of coastal wetlands, salt, brackish and freshwater marshes, respectively, was studied. In the greenhouse, south Louisiana crude oil was applied to natural marsh sods at rates of 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 l m(-2), The photosynthetic rate of S. patens significantly decreased with increasing oil dosage after 1 month of oil application, while the photosynthetic rate of S. alterniflora was not significantly reduced by oil application until 3 months. The photosynthetic rate of S. lancifolia was not detrimentally affected by the oil treatments. Four months after oil application, Live above-ground biomass production was significantly reduced at higher oil dosages for S. patens, was not affected in S, alterniflora, while S, lancifolia exhibited significantly higher total biomass at 24 l m(-2) compared to the controls. The year following oil application, no regrowth of S. patens and S. alterniflora occurred at oil levels above 8 l m(-2), In contrast, the regrowth of above-ground biomass of S. lancifolia increased with dosage and resulted increasing oil monospecific communities at Furthermore, the residual oil in the soil greatly differed among the three marsh-types, with the highest concentrations in the S. patens soil sods and the lowest concentrations in S, alterniflora soil sods. This difference in oil residue among the marsh-types was mainly due to differences in soil organic content, The sensitivity of these marsh-types to south Louisiana crude oil increased in the following order: S. lancifolia, S. alterniflora and S. patens.

TI  - Comparative coastal and marine tourism, climate change, and the blue economy in African Large Marine Ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper outlines potential opportunities for Africa's Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) development driven by blue economy from key strategic sectors including: Coastal and Marine Tourism; Climate Resilience; Environment; Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure. The sectoral approach is key to economic development in Africa with potential for income generation, employment creation and poverty reduction, as well as creating blue and green carbon sinks to address climate change problem and environmental management in African LMEs. The sectors establish linkages to countries' established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change making it possible to promote Integrated Approach at national, regional and continental sustainable development in Africa. The approach is complemented by the utilizing desk-top literature review and secondary data source on LMEs in Africa for blue economy. This approach is supplemented with professional experts' views and opinions, and additional data gathered from field visits to 13 African countries in August 2019 and Nairobi, Kenya Africa Blue Economy Strategy Consultative Workshop in October 2019. The Blue Economy approach development in Africa will benefit both inland and coastal countries. It is recommended that a strong development of the continental tourism will boost the demand for tourism services and infrastructures. The development of eco-tourism will contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and reduce the ecological footprint. Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services offer an opportunity to develop coastal wetland projects to mitigating climate change. Coastal protection, biomass production and water purification are among the most important ecosystem services delivered by African LMEs. Their current value is estimated to the average monetary value of carbon sequestration of about USD 130,000 per km(2) of mangrove, salt marshes and sea grasses.

TI  - Large variability in organic carbon and CaCO3 burial in seagrass meadows: a case study from three Australian estuaries
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3 temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org) and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3 burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which, if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may offset up to 89% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities. Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses, factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Conversion of coastal marshes to croplands decreases organic carbon but increases inorganic carbon in saline soils
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past century, conversion to agriculture has greatly reduced the global extent of coastal wetlands leading to degradation and loss of these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.

TI  - Influence of the conservation status on carbon balances of semiarid coastal Mediterranean wetlands
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Permanent freshwater and brackish marshes are the typical wetland type of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Historically, alterations to the original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (950  g m2 yr1), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and restoration for C exchange. Specifically, a highly altered site showed increased rates of aerobic respiration compared to undisturbed sites, with a decrease in C storage capacity to 50  g m2 yr1. Management practices resulting in instability of the organic sediments favoured degradative metabolism, with release of stored C and concomitant increases in CH4 emissions. Our results indicate that the hydromorphological alterations in these sites may convert healthy ecosystems contributing to C sequestration and climate change mitigation into C-emitting ecosystems.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved and particulate organic carbon fluxes were measured within the Bly Creek basin, North Inlet area, Georgetown County, South Carolina. 34 tidal cycles were sampled between 20 June 1983 and 19 June 1984. Flux direction and magnitude were determined for each measured tidal cycle. Continuously measured auxiliary variables were used in a regression model to produce annual flux estimates with minimum SE. Annual budgets were similarly developed for subsystems within the basin, and annual input to the basin by rain, groundwater, and freshwater runoff were estimated.Mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied from 2.5 to 11.8 mg C.l-1, with lowest values in the summer and fall and highest values in late winter and spring. Net flux estimates varied similarly with greatest exports occurring during late winter and spring. On an annual basis 1.85 x 10(5) kg C.yr-1 (SE 3.2 x 10(4) kg C.yr-1) was exported through the tidal creek. Freshwater inputs accounted for almost-equal-to 11% of the observed export with 1.65 x 10(5) kg C originating within the marsh basin.Particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations varied from 0.63 to 5.3 mg C.l-1 with largest concentrations in late summer. The annual basin flux estimate of 2.04 x 10(4) kg C.yr-1 imported was not statistically different from zero. However, there was a significant import of 2.1 x 10(4) kg C.yr from the tidal creek to the marsh surface.

TI  - Environmental controls on nitrogen and sulfur cycles in surficial aquatic sediments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) have disturbed their biogeochemical cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The N and S cycles interact with one another through competition for labile forms of organic carbon between nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, the N and S cycles could interact through nitrate (NO3-) reduction coupled to S oxidation, consuming NO3-, and producing sulfate (SO42-). The research questions of this study were: (1) what are the environmental factors explaining variability in N and S biogeochemical reaction rates in a wide range of surficial aquatic sediments when NO3- and SO42- are present separately or simultaneously, (2) how the N and S cycles could interact through S oxidation coupled to NO3- reduction, and (3) what is the extent of sulfate reduction inhibition by nitrate, and vice versa. The N and S biogeochemical reaction rates were measured on intact surface sediment slices using flow-through reactors. The two terminal electron acceptors NO3- and SO42- were added either separately or simultaneously and NO3- and SO42- reduction rates as well as NO3- reduction linked to S oxidation were determined. We used redundancy analysis, to assess how environmental variables were related to these rates. Our analysis showed that overlying water pH and salinity were two dominant environmental factors that explain 58% of the variance in the N and S biogeochemical reaction rates when NO3- and SO42- were both present. When NO3- and SO42- were added separately, however, sediment N content in addition to pH and salinity accounted for 62% of total variance of the biogeochemical reaction rates. The SO42- addition had little effect on NO3- reduction; neither did the NO3- addition inhibit SO42- reduction. The presence of NO3- led to SO42- production most likely due to the oxidation of sulfur. Our observations suggest that metal-bound S, instead of free sulfide produced by SO42- reduction, was responsible for the S oxidation.

TI  - Reconstruction of sedimentary environments for Late Pleistocene to Holocene coastal deposits of Lake Kamo, Sado Island, Central Japan
T2  - Quaternary Research (Tokyo)
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiproxy analyses including grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), total nitrogen (TN), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) contents, diatom as well as sedimentary properties of the boring core KM-11 (54 m in length) collected from a brackish lake, Lake Kamo, are used to reconstruct paleoenvironment and coastal evolution of northeast coast of Sado Island in central Japan. Anoxic and normal marine sediments can be detected by TOC-TS relationship, and the origin of organic matter is inferred from the TOC/TN ratio. Geochemical characteristics of the sediments respond striking to sea-level change. In the Late Pleistocene, fluvial sediments are characterized by high TOC, very low TS and terrigenous organic matter. The overlying coastal marsh sediments are characterized by high TOC and abruptly increasing trend of TS suggesting sea water spilled into the site, and are overlain by estuarine sediments which obviously indicates the beginning of the Holocene transgression. Embayment sediments are characterized by low TOC, marine organic matter and low productivity condition indicating the rapid relative sea-level rise. The maximum Holocene transgression could be inferred between 6,500 and 5,000 yrs BP. After that fluctuations of relative sea-level are characterized by high TOC, high TS, a mixed type of marine/terrigenous organic matter and high productivity condition to be inferred marine/brackish lagoonal sediments. Diatom floral changes of the core KM-11 also support the geochemical data to interpret the paleoenvironment and evolution of the coastal deposits.

TI  - Contrasting oxygen dynamics in Limonium narbonense and Sarcocornia fruticosa during partial and complete submergence
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial saltmarsh plants inhabitin flood-prone habitats undergo recurrent and prolonged flooding driven by tidal regimes. In this study, the role of internal plant aeration in contrasting hypoxiclanoxic conditions during submergence was investigated in the two halophytes Linionhan narbonense Mill. and Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) A.J. Scott. Monitoring of tissue O-2, dynamics was performed in shoots and roots using microelectrodes under drained conditions, waterlogging, partial and complete submergence, in light or darkness. For both species, submergence in darkness resulted in significant declines in tissue O-2 status and when in light, in rapid O-2, increases first in shoot tissues and subsequently in roots. During partial submergence, S. fruticosa benefitted from snorkelling and efficiently transported O-2 to roots, whereas the O-2 concentration in roots of L. narbonense declined by more than 90%, Significantly thinner leaves and articles were recorded under high degree of flooding stress and both species showed considerably high tissue porosity. The presence of aerenchyma seemed to support internal aeration in S. fruticosa whereas O-2 diffusion in L. narbonense seemed impeded, despite the higher porosity (up to 50%). Thus, the results obtained for L. narbonense, being well adapted to flooding, suggests that processes other than internal aeration could be involved in better flooding tolerance e.g. fermentative processes, and that traits resulting in flooding tolerance in plants are not yet fully understood.

TI  - SEASONAL CYCLING OF FE IN SALT-MARSH SEDIMENTS
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines an analysis of porewater chemistry with new, solid phase wet chemical extractions to examine the seasonal cycling of Fe in vegetated and unvegetated (cyanobacterial mat) saltmarsh sediments. Saltmarsh sediments are shown to contain more solid phase reactive Fe than other marine sediments studied so far. From the partitioning and speciation of solid Fe, and solid/soluble reduced S analysis in 10 sediment cores, we have observed that a majority of solid Fe in these sediments is cycled rapidly and completely between oxidized reactive Fe and reduced Fe as pyrite. Vegetated porewaters showed a lower pH and much higher Fe(II) concentrations on average than unvegetated porewaters in the top 10 cm, whereas sulfate, alkalinity, and sulfide concentrations were similar in the two environments. The amorphous Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation to solid and soluble reduced S (r(2) = -0.86 and -0.71, respectively) in surface vegetated sediments whereas the crystalline Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation (r(2) = -0.96) to sulfide only at depth. Though reactive Fe was observed in unvegetated sediments, no seasonal trend was apparent and the speciation of solid Fe revealed that most of it was reduced. Solid phase and porewater chemistry support the dominant role of the biota (Spartina alterniflora and bacteria) in controlling the reactivity of Fe and suggest that the current definition of solid phase, reactive Fe should be expanded to include crystalline Fe(III) minerals which are available for pyrite formation in saltmarsh sediments. In support of previous saltmarsh studies, we present evidence that the redox cycle of solid Fe is controlled by sulfate reduction and sediment oxidation which respond to both annual cycles (light, temperature) and to short-term, episodic effects such as weather and tides.

TI  - Net ecosystem production and organic carbon balance of U.S. East Coast estuaries: A synthesis approach
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem production (NEP) and the overall organic carbon budget for the estuaries along the East Coast of the United States are estimated. We focus on the open estuarine waters, excluding the fringing wetlands. We developed empirical models relating NEP to loading ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total organic carbon, and carbon burial in the sediment to estuarine water residence time and total nitrogen input across the landward boundary. Output from a data-constrained water quality model was used to estimate inputs of total nitrogen and organic carbon to the estuaries across the landward boundary, including fluvial and tidal-wetland sources. Organic carbon export from the estuaries to the continental shelf was computed by difference, assuming steady state. Uncertainties in the budget were estimated by allowing uncertainties in the supporting model relations. Collectively, U.S. East Coast estuaries are net heterotrophic, with the area-integrated NEP of -1.5 (-2.8, -1.0)TgCyr(-1) (best estimate and 95% confidence interval) and area-normalized NEP of -3.2 (-6.1, -2.3)molCm(-2)yr(-1). East Coast estuaries serve as a source of organic carbon to the shelf, exporting 3.4 (2.0, 4.3)TgCyr(-1) or 7.6 (4.4, 9.5)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources for the region are estimated at 5.4 (4.6, 6.5)TgCyr(-1) or 12 (10, 14)molCm(-2)yr(-1) and carbon burial in the open estuarine waters at 0.50 (0.33, 0.78)TgCyr(-1) or 1.1 (0.73, 1.7)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Our results highlight the importance of estuarine systems in the overall coastal budget of organic carbon, suggesting that in the aggregate, U.S. East Coast estuaries assimilate (via respiration and burial) similar to 40% of organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources and allow similar to 60% to be exported to the shelf.

TI  - Coastal Wetlands: Ecosystems Affected by Urbanization?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are ecosystems that provide multiple benefits to human settlements; nonetheless, they are seriously threatened due to both a lack of planning instruments and human activities associated mainly with urban growth. An understanding of their functioning and status is crucial for their protection and conservation. Two wetlands with different degrees of urbanization, Rocuant-Andalien (highly urbanized) and Tubul-Raqui (with little urbanization), were analyzed using temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, granulometry, fecal coliform, and macroinvertebrate assemblage variables in summer and winter. In both wetlands marked seasonality in salinity, temperature and sediment texture classification, regulated by oceanic influence and changes in the freshwater budget, was observed. In the Rocuant-Andalien wetland, the increases in pH, dissolved oxygen, gravel percentage, and coliform concentration were statistically significant. Urbanization generated negative impacts on macroinvertebrate assemblage structure that inhabit the wetlands; greater richness and abundance (8.5 times greater) were recorded in the Tubul-Raqui wetland than in the more urbanized wetland. The multivariate statistical analysis reflects the alteration of these complex systems.

T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial biomass, abundance, and productivity were greater in 3 tidal marsh creeks on the Chesapeake Bay side of the lower Delmarva Peninsula than in nearby creeks of the seaside coastal lagoon complex (biomass: 462 and 71 ng C ml-1; abundance: 12 x 10(6) and 3.8 x 10(6) cells ml-1; productivity: 46 and 7.3 ng C ml-1 h-1; bayside and seaside respectively). Bacterial cell-size distributions were also significantly different between the seaside and bayside creeks, with a larger proportion of smaller cells dominating samples from the seaside creeks. Bayside and seaside concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were similar (approximately 49 mg l-1 TSS and 3.5 mg l-1 DOC). The amount of organic matter (OM) and chlorophyll a was higher in the bayside creeks, while inorganic N and P concentrations were higher in the seaside creeks (OM: 9.0 and 3.4 mg l-1; chlorophyll a: 6.0 and 4.1 g l-1; PO43-: 0.2 and 1.2 muM; NH4+: 0.6 and 1.2 muM; bayside and seaside respectively). The high inorganic nutrient pools combined with the low levels of bacterial productivity suggest that bacterial production is not limited by N or P in the seaside creeks and that the amount of carbon moving through the bacterial loop is much less than on the bayside. In fact, DOC turnover times were much longer for the seaside (22 d) than for the bayside (6 d). Reasons for the observed differences in bacterial dynamics for the bay and seasides are not known specifically, but may be related to differences in the source of the DOC (marsh grass vs phytoplankton), grazing on the bacterial cells, or bacterial community structure.

TI  - Green beach vegetation dynamics explained by embryo dune development
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy coastlines are dynamic environments with potential for biodiverse habitats, such as green beaches. Green beach vegetation can develop on nutrient-poor beaches landward from embryo dunes. It is characterised by low-dynamic coastal wetland habitat such as salt marshes and dune slacks. It has been hypothesised that the establishment of green beach vegetation is facilitated by the shelter provided by embryo dunes, however evidence is lacking.We explored the importance of geomorphology and soil conditions on the species richness and turnover of green beach vegetation over a time period of 10 years. We recorded 107 plots along 11 transects over a gradient from beach to dune on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. We characterised transect geomorphology at transect level and soil conditions and vegetation at plot level in 2006 and 2016.We found that the green beach vegetation was highly dynamic, total plant cover increased by 62% within 10 years. In 2006 beach width was an important factor in explaining species richness, with the highest number of species occurring on narrow beaches with a large volume of embryo dunes. In 2016, species richness was positively associated with the build-up of organic matter. Overall species richness declined relative to 2006 and was accompanied by an increase in elevation due to sand burial and the expansion of embryo dune volume.Our data suggests that geomorphology influenced the vegetation indirectly by affecting sand burial rate. Plant species richness declined less at sheltered conditions where sand burial was limited, allowing the build-up of organic matter. This indicates a time-dependent relationship between the development of embryo dunes and plant species richness: embryo dunes can be a source of shelter, thus increasing species richness, but can compete for space over time, lowering species richness again. Our results are relevant for engineering and management of biodiverse sandy shores. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

TI  - THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT OF THE INTERTIDAL AREA IN THE WESTERSCHELDE NETHERLANDS BELGIUM
T2  - Hydrobiological Bulletin
M3  - Article
AB  - hydrodynamic forces and sediment discharges determine the sedimentary environment and surface morphology of the intertidal area in the Westerschelde estuary in the S.W. Netherlands. Sandflats (clay, content < 8%) are found in the central part, mudflats (> 8% clay) and especially salt marshes (> 15% clay) occur in sheltered places. The semi-terrestrial soil of the intertidal area is a complex environment where hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, and atomosphere interact. Surface morphology and the semi-diurnal tide may significantly modify this interaction pattern. Organic matter and constituents of the clay-size fraction are the most reactive compounds in the soil. The pathway and rate of organic matter decomposition determines the nature of many biogeochemical processes. Sulfur transformation are dominant processes in the sulfidic grey-black coloured horizons underneath the generally thin yellow-brown surface layer. The sulfur geochemistry also affects the sorption-behaviour of metals. Oxygen intrusion by diffusion, burrowing fauna and plant roots cause a local and sometimes temporary oxidation of reduced inorganic compounds. Thus, in the surface layers, and in and around tubes and roots at greater depth in the soil, a dynamic cycling occurs of redox active compounds, which affects the sorption mechanism of e.g. metals-ions.

TI  - Trophic importance of a temperate intertidal wetland to resident and itinerant taxa: evidence from multiple stable isotope analyses
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Juveniles of commercially important fish species congregate in shallow vegetated estuarine habitats during high tides. Considerable debate has centred on whether the significance of these habitats lies in their provision of greater feeding opportunities, or shelter from predation afforded by greater structural complexity. We tested the hypothesis that an inundated mangrove and saltmarsh wetland provided feeding opportunities for itinerant species, and that the contribution of wetland primary producers and grazing herbivores could be identified in their diet, using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Potential sources of dietary carbon included mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass, seagrass epiphytic material and benthic organic material. Saltmarsh plants (mostly Sporobolus virginicus and Juncus kraussii) and fine benthic organic material appeared to be the primary sources of dietary carbon for the resident grazing herbivores in the wetlands, based on IsoSource mixing models. During high tide, species of itinerant fish enter the mangrove and, when inundated, the saltmarsh, and feed primarily on crab larvae and copepods. Fine benthic organic matter, seagrass epiphyte, and C-3 and C-4 plant materials also supplement the diet of some fish. The crab larvae therefore provide a significant source of nutrition and an important link between the intertidal wetlands and the adjacent estuarine ecosystem. The carnivorous fish Acanthopagrus australis, at the highest trophic level, hunted within or adjacent to the mangrove-saltmarsh wetland and fed on several lower-order consumers within the wetland. The present study highlights the significance of mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands as a feeding habitat for resident grazers and itinerant nekton.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of PCBs by a seaweed bloom (Ulva rigida) and transfer to higher trophic levels in an estuarine food web
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many urban estuaries worldwide contain both eutrophication-induced macroalgal blooms and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in their sediments. Between 2007 and 2012, we studied an annually occurring green tide of Ulva rigida in the PCB-contaminated Superfund site of New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA. Ulva PCB concentrations were highest (95-99 mg kg(-1) dry weight) near the contamination source and decreased to only 2-4 mg kg(-1) at the site's southern end, approximately 2.5 km away. To assess the bloom's potential role as a PCB contributor to higher trophic levels, we performed stomach content analysis on the system's primary mid-trophic level predator, the salt marsh mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, and stable isotope analysis on associated potential energy sources. In addition to detritus and macroinvertebrate prey, Ulva was a major component of mummichog stomach contents, and a N-15-labeled feeding experiment demonstrated that mummichogs can assimilate ingested Ulva. Among invertebrate prey, stable isotope mixing models showed Uiva as the main diet source for amphipods Gammarus spp., while grass shrimp Palaemonetes spp. and sandworms Nereis spp. relied on a mix of Lava and Spartina or particulate organic matter, respectively. Sandworms and grass shrimp were the main mummichog energy sources, suggesting that this estuarine keystone species is linked to the (Eva bloom mainly through predation on Ova-consuming grazers rather than direct ingestion. Our data provide evidence for a potentially overlooked impact of macroalgal blooms-namely, their potential role in the trophic transfer of PCBs and other bioaccumulated pollutants.

TI  - Field measurements and modeling of groundwater flow and biogeochemistry at Moses Hammock, a backbarrier island on the Georgia coast
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of field measurements, laboratory experiments and model simulations were used to characterize the groundwater biogeochemical dynamics along a shallow monitoring well transect on a coastal hammock. A switch in the redox status of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pool in the well at the upland/saltmarsh interface occurred over the spring-neap tidal transition: the DIN pool was dominated by nitrate during spring tide and by ammonium during neap tide. A density-dependent reaction-transport model was used to investigate the relative importance of individual processes to the observed N redox-switch. The observed N redox-switch was evaluated with regard to the roles of nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), ammonium adsorption, and variations in inflowing water geochemistry between spring and neap tides. Transport was driven by measured pressure heads and process parameterizations were derived from field observations, targeted laboratory experiments, and the literature. Modeling results suggest that the variation in inflow water chemistry was the dominant driver of DIN dynamics and highlight the importance of spring-neap tide variations in the high marsh, which influences groundwater biogeochemistry at the marsh-upland transition.

TI  - Unrecognized controls on microbial functioning in Blue Carbon ecosystems: The role of mineral enzyme stabilization and allochthonous substrate supply
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are effective carbon sinks, mitigating climate change through the long-term removal of atmospheric CO2. Studies along surface-elevation and thus flooding-frequency gradients in tidal wetlands are often used to understand the effects of accelerated sea-level rise on carbon sequestration, a process that is primarily determined by the balance of primary production and microbial decomposition. It has often been hypothesized that rates of microbial decomposition would increase with elevation and associated increases in soil oxygen availability; however, previous studies yield a wide range of outcomes and equivocal results. Our mechanistic understanding of the elevation-decomposition relationship is limited because most effort has been devoted to understanding the terminal steps of the decomposition process. A few studies assessed microbial exo-enzyme activities (EEAs) as initial and rate-limiting steps that often reveal important insight into microbial energy and nutrient constraints. The present study assessed EEAs and microbial abundance along a coastal ecotone stretching a flooding gradient from tidal flat to high marsh in the European Wadden Sea. We found that stabilization of exo-enzymes to mineral sediments leads to high specific EEAs at low substrate concentrations in frequently flooded, sediment-rich zones of the studied ecotone. We argue that the high background activity of a mineral-associated enzyme pool provides a stable decomposition matrix in highly dynamic, frequently flooded zones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microbial communities are less nutrient limited in frequently flooded zones, where inputs of nutrient-rich marine organic matter are higher. This was reflected in both increasing exo-enzymatic carbon versus nutrient acquisition and decreasing fungal versus bacterial abundance with increasing flooding frequency. Our findings thereby suggest two previously unrecognized mechanisms that may contribute to stimulated microbial activity despite decreasing oxygen availability in response to accelerated sea-level rise.

TI  - Palaeoenvironmental investigations of the Holocene sedimentary record of the Garding-2 research drill core, northwestern Germany
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN
M3  - Article
AB  - A 20 m section of calcareous, fine- to coarse-grained Holocene sediments forming the upper part of the Garding-2 core, taken near Garding on the Eiderstedt Peninsula in Northwest Germany, has been analysed for pollen and for its sedimentological and geochemical characteristics to reconstruct the Holocene environmental history of this coastal area.The studied sediment sequence was deposited above an unconformity at 20 m depth formed by major erosion due to the rapid sea-level rise in the Early Holocene. A thin layer of marine sediments at the base, possibly correlating to the late Atlantic, is unconformably overlain by marine-tidal flat deposits up to 11.00 m depth. The Subboreal age of these deposits is evidenced by the first occurrence of Fagus at 15.97 m, which is OSL-dated, at 16.22 m, to about 3130 +/- 260 BP (Zhang et al. 2014) and Carpinus at 15.03 m. The Ulmus decline, a palynological characteristic marking the Atlantic to Subboreal transition in northwestern Europe, is not revealed in the pollen sequence. Ulmus shows low values throughout the entire pollen diagram. It is therefore assumed that late Atlantic transitional sediments were eroded in Garding-2.Sandy sediments between about 11.00 m and the top of the sequence are palynologically characterised by increased representation of local salt marsh, dune and tidal flat vegetation, indicated by the abundance of Poaceae, Cerealia-type pollen, probably derived mainly from wild grasses, and increased percentages of Ericaceae, Cyperaceae and Chenopodiaceae. These upper deposits are AMS C-14-dated to 2790 +/- 20 BP (at 11.41 m) and 1820 +/- 50 BP (at 2.70 m; Zhang et al. 2014) suggesting an early Subatlantic age. Due to regional features and peculiarities of the coastal environment, significant anthropogenic impact on landscape as well as the expansion of Fagus and Carpinus, characteristic for the Subboreal to Subatlantic transition at about 2700 BP in Northern Germany, are not clearly reflected in the pollen diagram.

TI  - Mangrove Ecosystem Service Values and Methodological Approaches to Valuation: Where Do We Stand?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes, collectively termed "Blue Forests," are counted among the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. A recent literature review of the Blue Forest valuation research identified mangroves as the most frequently analyzed of these ecosystems, yet the literature demonstrates several deficits in terms of geographic location of studies, methods used to value the services, and most notably, a lack of valuation for cultural services. To better understand this, we analyzed the studies dealing specifically with mangroves from the original literature review to quantify what has been valued, where, by which methods, and the variation in the published values. We then use this information to synthesize our current level of knowledge on the type and value of services provided by mangroves, discuss data gaps, and address specifically the collection of data relevant to cultural ecosystem services (CES). Our results shed light on two principle issues affecting the mangrove valuation literature: overuse of benefit transfer in valuing mangrove ecosystem services and a lack of attention paid to the CES that mangroves provide. The mangrove valuation literature is not yet robust, lacking estimates of many ecosystem services, including CES, such as spiritual and aesthetic value. Most published studies focus on a small selection of ecosystem services based on the availability of benefit transfer values and the ability to easily measure values with market prices. Thus, many ecosystem services that cannot be valued monetarily, but that are often equally important to local communities, are ignored. Given the wide range of ecosystem services mangroves provide and the variety of valuation methods that need to be collectively employed, we argue that doing valuation studies well requires a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together anthropologists, social scientists, ecologists and economists. Thoughtfully and thoroughly including the local stakeholders in valuation studies and the resultant policy discussions leads to a more holistic understanding of the services mangroves provide, and viable solutions with an increase in local willingness to act in accordance with those solutions.

TI  - Effects of diking on the biological performance of the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans L.) in an Atlantic mangrove forest
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of diking on the photosynthetic rate, gross glucose production, biomass, and nutrient levels of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans L., were investigated during the major dry, the major wet and the intermediate season in completely diked mangrove areas, and compared to partially diked and non-diked biotopes. In the major dry and major wet seasons, the photosynthetic rate and gross glucose production were two to five times lower in the completely diked sites compared to the partially diked and non-diked habitats. The average dry weights of branches, flowers and leaves did not differ significantly between sites. The same held true for propagules from the major dry and major wet season. However, propagules from the transition period collected in the non-diked and partially diked biotopes yielded appreciable amounts of dry matter, while plants in the completely diked forests did not carry any propagules. No statistically significant differences were found among nutrient content in the leaves of plants from the different habitats. Our results suggest black mangrove growing in diked habitats may suffer a certain degree of environmental stress, which may affect important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, gross glucose production, and propagule formation.

TI  - Effects of tidal fluctuations on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the littoral zone of a brackish-water lake
T2  - LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the effects of tidal fluctuations on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from sediment or soil to the atmosphere in the littoral zone of a brackish-water lake during the growing seasons in 2004 and 2005. The dominant plants at the study site formed three sub-zones (Phragmites zone, Juncus zone and Miscanthus zone) across a topographic gradient on the shoreline. In the Phragmites and Juncus zones, we observed a positive correlation between hourly changes in CO2 and CH4 fluxes and changes in the water table. In particular, the magnitude and pattern of daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes were different on days during spring tide and neap tide in the Phragmites and Juncus zones. Variations in CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Phragmites and Juncus zones over the course of a day during spring tide were correlated with water-table level. We found that the rate of change of the water table, as distinguished from just differences in the water table, was a major environmental factor controlling the CO2 and CH4 fluxes. In the Miscanthus zone during spring tide, soil temperature was the main factor affecting daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes.

TI  - Microbial Responses to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: From Coastal Wetlands to the Deep Sea
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 7
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico represents the largest marine accidental oil spill in history. It is distinguished from past spills in that it occurred at the greatest depth (1,500 m), the amount of hydrocarbon gas (mostly methane) lost was equivalent to the mass of crude oil released, and dispersants were used for the first time in the deep sea in an attempt to remediate the spill. The spill is also unique in that it has been characterized with an unprecedented level of resolution using next-generation sequencing technologies, especially for the ubiquitous hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities that appeared largely to consume the gases and to degrade a significant fraction of the petroleum. Results have shown an unexpectedly rapid response of deep-sea Gammaproteobacteria to oil and gas and documented a distinct succession correlated with the control of the oil flow and well shut-in. Similar successional events, also involving Gammaproteobacteria, have been observed in nearshore systems as well.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the advantage of a combined use of chemical and isotopic tools to understand the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) cycle in a regional confined methanogenic aquifer. DOC concentration and carbon isotopic data demonstrate that the soil zone is a primary carbon source of groundwater DOC in areas close to recharge zones. An in-situ DOC source linked to organic rich sediments present in the aquifer matrix is controlling the DOC pool in the central part of the groundwater flow system. DOC fractions, C-13-NMR on fulvic acids and C-14 data on DOC and CH4 support the hypothesis that the in-situ DOC source is a terrestrial organic matter and discard the Ordovician bedrock as a source of DOC.

TI  - The anaerobic oxidation of methane and sulfate reduction in sediments from Gulf of Mexico cold seeps
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We determined the geochemical characteristics of sediments and measured rates of the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulfate reduction (SR) in samples collected near thermogenic (structure II) gas hydrate mounds and in areas lacking hydrates along the continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico. We used radiotracer (C-14 and S-35) techniques to determine rates of AOM and SR over depth in sediment cores. Abundant mats of white and orange Beggiatoa spp. were common in areas of active seepage and these sediments were enriched in hydrogen sulfide and methane. In cores collected from areas without Beggiatoa or hydrate, concentrations of redox metabolites showed little variation over depth and these sites were inferred to be areas of low seepage. Integrated AOM rates were low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<0.05 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 2.8 +/- 4.6 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in seep cores that contained Beggiatoa or gas hydrate. Integrated SR rates were also low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<1 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 54 +/- 94 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in cores with Beggiatoa or hydrate. Rates of SR generally exceeded rates of AOM and the two processes were loosely coupled, suggesting that the majority of SR at Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon seep sites is likely fueled by the oxidation of other organic matter, possibly other hydrocarbons and oil, rather than by AOM.

T2  - NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
M3  - Data set
AB  - Nutrient exchange fluxes in the dark and light, calculated in moles per hour per square metre, between sediment cores and overlying site water in salt marsh and intertidal mudflat locations in Essex and Morecombe Bay, Lancashire in January and August 2013. Net fluxes of nitrate, nitrate, ammonium, oxygen and dissolved organic carbon were measured in temperature controlled water baths over three hour periods. This data was collected as part of Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS): NE/J015644/1. The project was funded with support from the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (BESS) programme. BESS is a six-year programme (2011-2017) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) as part of the UK's Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) programme. One sediment core was taken from each of the twelve quadrats using 8cm diameter plastic cores at six sites, three in Essex: Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes; three in Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain. Sampling took place in January and August 2013. Sediment cores and three water control cores (pipes containing site water for each location but no sediment) were submerged in tanks of locally collected sea water under daylight simulating bulbs. Light levels and temperatures differed between summer and winter to take into account seasonal variation. Cores were incubated in both the light and the dark to measure fluxes under both conditions. Changes in water column concentrations over 2 to 4 hour periods were taken to calculate fluxes of Oxygen, Non purgable organic carbon (NPOC), Nitrate, NOx, Ammonia, Nitrate, Phosphate and Silicate measured by submerging sediment cores in seawater and measuring concentrations of the chemicals in the overlying water.

TI  - FACTORS REGULATING PLANKTON COMMUNITY RESPIRATION IN CHESAPEAKE BAY
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates of plankton community respiration were measured in surface and bottom waters during spring, summer and autumn in the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Seasonal patterns of plankton respiration generally followed the annual temperature cycle, with peak rates in July and August of 40 to 70 mug O2 l-1 h-1, which are among the highest values reported in the literature. In addition, strong diel variations in surface water community respiration, with mid-day maxima, were coherent with cycles of irradiance and photosynthesis, suggesting the dependence of community respiration on recently produced organic matter. The range of diel variations in respiration during summer was almost half the annual range in mean rates. Size-fractionated incubations demonstrated the importance of picoplankton (< 3 mum) respiration compared to total rates. On average, picoplankton accounted for most of community respiration in surface waters (56 %) and dominated total rates in the summer pycnocline (89 %). This size fraction was less important in the bottom waters during spring (23 %). Temperature per se as a control on plankton respiration was investigated by comparing rates at in situ temperatures against those measured in temperature-manipulated experiments in spring and summer. Strong relations between respiration and temperature were observed in all cases; least-squares regressions (exponential and linear) for experimental data were not significantly different between seasons, nor between the experiments and the seasonal rates measured at in situ temperatures. These results suggest the absence of significant physiological adaptation and/or selection for temperature optima over the annual cycle. Respiration by bacterioplankton (< 1 mum) exhibited no oxygen dependence down to concentrations of 0.16 mg O2 l-1; however, rates for whole water (unfiltered) declined with decreasing oxygen below 0.8 mg O2 l-1. Evidently, diffusion limited oxygen consumption by proto- and metazoans as well as bacteria associated with detrital particles and organic flocs.

AB  - Critical military training and testing on lands along the nations coastal and estuarine shorelines are increasingly placed at risk because of encroachment pressures in surrounding areas, impairments due to other anthropogenic disturbances, and changes in climate and sea level. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) intends to enhance and sustain its training and testing assets and also optimize its stewardship of natural resources through the development and application of an ecosystem-based management approach on DoD installations. To accomplish this goal, particularly for installations in estuarine/coastal environments, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) launched the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) as a 10-year effort at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) in North Carolina. The results of the second 5 years of the program (DCERP2) are presented in the DCERP2 Final Report.There were four overarching objectives of DCERP2. The first objective was to understand the effects of climate change impacts, including warming temperatures, variability in the hydrological cycle, storm events, and sea level rise on the coastal ecosystems at MCBCL from observations and measurements made over the 10-year program. The second objective was to understand the carbon cycle of the coastal and terrestrial ecosystems at MCBCL through a highly integrated sampling program. The third objective was to develop models, tools, and indicators to evaluate current and projected future ecosystem state changes and translate scientific findings into actionable information for installation managers. The last objective was to recommend adaptive management strategies to sustain ecosystem natural resources within the context of an active military installation.This dataset represents the results of seasonal samplings of triplicate paired fertilized and control plots across three marsh sites at Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, NC. It was used to compare chemical characteristics and processes across the three locations to determine the factors driving the response of salt marsh sustainability to fertilization.

TI  - Marine productivity leads organic matter preservation in sapropel S1: palynological evidence from a core east of the Nile River outflow
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of Eastern Mediterranean organic matter rich deposits known as sapropels is the results of two mechanisms: (enhanced) marine productivity and preservation of organic material at depth. However, their relative contribution and their leads and lags with respect to each other remain elusive. Here, we address these questions by studying sediments deposited prior to, during, and after the most recent sapropel (S1, similar to 10-6 calibrated ka before present, BP) with an integrated marine and terrestrial palynological approach, combined with existing and newly generated geochemical data. The studied core was retrieved from an area under strong influence of the Nile outflow and has high average sediment accumulation rates allowing a high temporal resolution (of several decades to centuries). Marine productivity, as reconstructed with total dinocyst accumulation rates (ARs) and biogenic CaCO3 content, starts to increase similar to 1 ka prior to sapropel formation. A shift in the dinocyst taxa contributing to the productivity signal at sapropel onset indicates the rapid development of (seasonal) water column stratification. Pollen and spore ARs also increase prior to sapropel onset, but a few centuries after the increase in marine productivity. Hence, the first shift to a high marine productivity system before sapropel deposition may have been mostly favoured by the injection of nutrients via shoaling of the nutricline with a minor contribution of nutrients from land via river input and flooding of the shelves. Pollen assemblages indicate a gradual change across the sapropel onset from a savanna-like, through coastal marsh expansion, toward an open woodland assemblage, which is consistent with enhanced Nile influence and delta development. At sapropel onset a marked shift in pollen ARs could suggest increased preservation under anoxia. However, major shifts in pollen assemblages and signs of selective- or partial decomposition of terrestrial palynomorphs are absent. We therefore suggest that the high pollen ARs largely result from an increased influx of pollen by enhanced Nile discharge and extension of the freshwater plume. Three centuries after the sapropel onset, dinocyst ARs and CaCO3 content indicate that marine productivity starts to decrease, while sapropel deposition continued. Organic carbon content decreased only later and less dramatically. This may be explained by a shift in the dominance of the organisms contributing to marine productivity, to an enhanced preservation of organic matter, or a combination of both. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A synthesis of soil carbon and nitrogen recovery after wetland restoration and creation in the United States
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland restoration and creation efforts have been widely attempted as a way to compensate for wetland losses and to recover wetland functions; however, to date, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content recovery at a regional scale. This meta-analysis synthesizes 48 articles to identify the general patterns of soil C and N change after wetland restoration and creation in the United States. Our results indicate that, after 11-20 years, soil C and N in restored and created wetlands are still significantly lower by 51.7% and 50.3%, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C and N in restored wetlands recovered faster than in created wetlands. Furthermore, the soil C in restored organic flat and created depressional wetlands recovered more rapidly than in restored and created hydrologically open wetlands (riverine and tidal), respectively. Mean annual temperature and soil texture were recognized as two crucial abiotic factors affecting soil C and N recovery. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between the restoration and creation effect sizes on soil C and N, indicating that wetlands may alleviate N limitations intrinsically during C recovery processes.

TI  - Intertidal morphology change following Spartina anglica introduction, Tamar Estuary, Tasmania
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface morphology and sediment characteristics of introduced Spartina anglica marshes of the Tamar Estuary were analysed using a combination of spatial mapping, land-based topographical surveys, sediment coring and identification of the pre-introduction surface. Such a morphological investigation of estuarine change following Spartina introduction has not been attempted elsewhere before. A difference was found between marshes in upper and lower estuary. Surface topography of Type-1 marshes of the upper estuary was found to be independent of the pre-Spartina surface morphology, with deeper vertical development and exhibiting a flat to slightly concave upper marsh, a convex ridge in the outer mid marsh, and a relatively steeply graded convex lower marsh. Type-2 marshes of the lower estuary were thinner in vertical development, and with surface topography dictated by the underlying pre-Spartina surface. The difference was found to be due to variations in environmental conditions in sediment supply and wave/current exposure between the two regions rather being an indication of relative maturity. The seaward edge of marshes was found to be 0.5 m lower at the seaward end of the Tamar relative to the landward, reflecting tidal amplification up this confined estuary. While Spartina marshes are accretionary, surveys demonstrated retreat of the seaward margins throughout the estuary over the past 17 years, and the development of erosional scarps in Type-1 marshes. Spatial mapping identified 374 ha of S. anglica infestation within the Tamar Estuary, with Type-1 marshes occupying 240 ha and Type-2 marshes occupying 134 ha. Topographic profiles and stratigraphic data were used to estimate total sediment volumes trapped by Spartina in the Tamar Estuary, finding approximately 1,193,441 m(3) of material to have been trapped beneath Spartina since its introduction in 1947, of which between 14 and 28% has been Spartina-derived organic matter.

TI  - Ecophysiological response of native and invasive Spartina species to extreme temperature events in Mediterranean marshes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent IPCC WG2 5th Assessment Report (IPCC 2014), notes an increase in the frequency and duration of extreme climatic events, especially for the Mediterranean region. Together with climate change, the invasion of natural communities by non-indigenous species (NIS) constitutes a serious threat to biodiversity. One of these NIS is the American Spartina patens, now present in Western European marshes. The present study aims to understand the biochemical and photochemical responses of S. patens compared with S. maritima under extreme temperature events. Under normal and extreme heat conditions, S. patens had a higher photosynthetic efficiency (alpha), compared with cold wave events, where the native S. maritima was far more efficient. This reduced photosynthetic efficiency was mostly due to a decrease in the connectivity between photosystem II (PSII) antennae. This was accompanied by severe damage to the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII. On the other hand, S. patens oxygen evolving complexes (OECs) seem to be temperature insensitive. The light absorption capacity was maintained due to a higher net rate of reaction centre (RC) closure as a counteractive measure of the reduced number of RC, especially in S. maritima. The loss of connectivity between PSII antennae and damage in OECs under heat stress leads to a severe reduction in the maximum yield for photochemistry enhanced by the low probability of each absorbed quanta to produce electronic work. However, while S. maritima presents high energy losses under heat stress, S. patens developed efficient quenching mechanisms under thermal stress, through auroxanthin. In S. patens, cold wave-treated individuals also displayed a very active line of enzymatic defences for reactive oxygen species scavenging. In fact, only cold treated individuals of this species presented higher activities of anti-oxidant enzymes, revealing some degree of adaptation to this new environment. In contrast, in S. maritima the exposure to extreme heat periods led, in most cases, to a decrease in the enzymatic defences, leaving the cell prone to oxidative damage. In summary, S. patens appears to have a higher fitness for the incoming climatic scenarios, being more tolerant to heat stress, while S. maritima will have its photobiological fitness decreased. This will impose a shift in the salt marsh biodiversity, favouring the non-indigenous S. patens expansion.

TI  - Predicting carbon and nutrient transformations in tidal freshwater wetlands of the Hudson River
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The exchange of water between the main channel of the tidal freshwater Hudson River and its tidal wetlands is a large proportion of the whole-river water volume and causes large changes in concentrations of some dissolved and suspended constituents. Ten representative wetlands were assessed for their ability to alter quantities of inorganic nutrients, suspended particles, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved oxygen during tidal exchange. The majority of sites acted as sinks for oxygen and nitrate and as sources of DOC. For other variables such as phosphate and pigments, individual wetlands varied broadly in both the direction and magnitude of change. For some variables (oxygen, DOC) we found mechanistically plausible predictors for the magnitude of alteration. The proportional coverage of submerged vegetation or intertidal marsh graminoid vegetation was related to the degree of change in oxygen and DOC. For most cases, however, we did not find strong predictors and we attribute this to the spatial positioning of "hot spots" or redundancy in the processes actually responsible for the transformation. Our ability to predict ecosystem performance from whole-ecosystem attributes may be impeded by lack of consideration of within-system spatial contingencies or lack of knowledge of which process is actually responsible for the observed alteration in material flux.

TI  - Restoring for the climate: a review of coastal wetland restoration research in the last 30 years
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services yet are ranked among some of the most imperiled habitats. To maximize prioritization of these habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1) summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration, (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g. blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020, with 40% of the research published just in the last triennia (2018-2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of ecological processes.

TI  - Influence of the conservation status on carbon balances of semiarid coastal Mediterranean wetlands
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent freshwater and brackish marshes are the typical wetland type of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Historically, alterations to the original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (similar to 950g m(-2) yr(-1)), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and restoration for C exchange. Specifically, a highly altered site showed increased rates of aerobic respiration compared to undisturbed sites, with a decrease in C storage capacity to similar to 50g m(-2) yr(-1). Management practices resulting in instability of the organic sediments favoured degradative metabolism, with release of stored C and concomitant increases in CH4 emissions. Our results indicate that the hydromorphological alterations in these sites may convert healthy ecosystems contributing to C sequestration and climate change mitigation into C-emitting ecosystems.

CL  - VINELAND, NJ
AB  - In 1980, Scott Nixon reviewed the role of salt marshes in estuarine and coastal productivity. His review was effectively a progress report on the testing of "The Outwelling Hypothesis" (Odum, 1980). Nixon (1980) signaled a crucial turning point in the direction of estuarine flux studies conducted since then. In this review we revisit Nixon (1980), focusing on research and thinking that has been guided by The Outwelling Concept in the last two decades. Since 1980, estuarine flux studies have been conducted at 41 different sites and presented in over 42 publications. More than a third of these were conducted in Europe, Africa, Australia, or Mexico. Our review of these studies highlighted several important advances. The first was evolution of a conceptual approach that decomposes the estuary-coastal ocean landscape into interacting subsystems (i.e., the coastal ocean, estuarine basins, and marsh). Most post-1980 flux studies have addressed interactions between these individual subsystems, often in an hierarchical sense. Over half of these quantified exchanges between marsh-dominated basins and the greater estuary-generally through a single, well-defined tidal channel. From these data, we found that tidal range, subsystem area, and distance to the ocean together explained 87% of the variability in total organic carbon (TOC) exchanges and 92% of the variability in total suspended solids (TSS) fluxes, with exports occurring at lower tidal ranges, areas, and distances. Tidal range explained 40% of the variability in nitrate + nitrite (NN) exchange (with uptake at ranges below about 1.2 m and export at greater tidal ranges) and 39% of available phosphorus (SRP) flux variation (with export at ranges below about 1.6 m), We were unable to extract similar relationships from whole-estuary exchange studies because so few exist. The geomorphological setting and degree of ecological maturity (analogous to geologic age) of a marsh or basin within an estuary are important controllers of ecological function, thus flux behavior, We applied concepts of community succession and ecosystem development to data from marsh-water column Aux studies, and found that slope of Aux vs. tidal height relationships was greater for younger marshes compared to all marshes, and much greater for younger marshes compared to older marshes. This change in slope often caused a shift in the inflection point that indicated the tidal range at which export shifted to import, or vice verse, These studies quantified surficial fluxes, though, and a number of post-1980 studies demonstrated the importance of other processes, including subsurface flow, subtidal advection, and the movement of nutrients and organic matter by animals (other chapters in this volume address these precesses), Finally, a number of studies showed strong controls on fluxes by exogenous environmental forcing, and we reviewed several studies that used innovative budgeting and modeling of Aux dynamics and ecological precesses to incorporate these sources of variability. Since 1980 we have learned a great deal more about how estuarine wetlands interact with their estuaries, and of the value of establishing a conceptual framework and system boundaries. Estuarine ecologists have learned a great deal about outwelling as a concept although few flux studies have directly addressed the original Outwelling Hypothesis.We suggest that the question should not be "Is The Outwelling Hypothesis true?" but rather: 1) how are materials being exchanged between different subsystems in estuary-coastal ocean landscapes? 2) what are the mechanisms of this exchange? and 3) how do exogenous forcings control these patterns of exchange? Estuarine scientists are encouraged to view The Outwelling Hypothesis as a conceptual stimulus of ideas and not as a strict statistical hypothesis that must be proven or disproven.

TI  - Impact of crab bioturbation on benthic flux and nitrogen dynamics of Southwest Atlantic intertidal marshes and mudflats
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of the SW Atlantic intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata on benthic metabolism, benthic flux, and benthic N cycling processes was investigated through field experiments and in situ benthic chambers incubations. Our experimental results show that the presence and activity of N. granulata and its burrows may affect the direction and magnitude of nutrient benthic fluxes. Bioturbation enhanced ammonium efflux at mudflats, and influx at marshes. The flux of nitrate toward the sediment was stimulated by crabs at light and dark conditions in marshes, but only under light exposure in mudflats. Crab bioturbation stimulated benthic metabolism, N mineralization, nitrification and denitrification potentials in both sites. Crabs seem to have contrasting effects on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) availability between marshes and mudflats, as reflected on benthic DIN flux. This different effect on DIN availability and also the possible different effects of crabs on N-2-fixers organisms could explain the opposite N-2 fixation pattern found for both habitats, since crabs promoted N2 fixation in marshes, but diminished its rate in mudflats. Thus, the results obtained here through manipulative field experiments using benthic chambers suggest that macrofauna may influence the N benthic cycle and DIN fluxes in estuarine sediments. Besides, these macrofauna effects could be context-dependent, being many of them opposite between mudflats and marshes. We concluded that the above mentioned effects and the bioturbation macrophytes interaction may be affecting the dissolved nutrient exportation from marshes to open waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Lateral detrital C transfer across a Spartina alterniflora invaded estuarine wetland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The lateral movements of mass and energy across the terrestrial-aquatic interface are being increasingly recognized for their importance in the carbon (C) balance of coastal/estuarine wetlands. We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.

TI  - Assessing the role of the "estuarine filter" for emerging contaminants: pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl compounds and plasticisers in sediment cores from two contrasting systems in the southern UK
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental occurrence, fate and ecotoxicity of emerging contaminants (ECs) has been the subject of increasing research, policy and public concern over the past two decades. While a wide range of publications have examined the environmental persistence and sediment/soil interactions of ECs following their discharge into aquatic environments, the extent to which ECs are sequestered in estuarine sediments, and the impact of this on their environmental persistence and supply to the ocean, in comparison remains unclear. This Article examines the environmental concentrations of seven, relatively water-soluble and environmentally mobile, ECs (including pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and plasticisers) in dated intertidal saltmarsh cores from two contrasting estuarine sites in the southern U.K. (one heavily urbanised/industrial, the other non-urbanised). Mean sediment EC concentrations are similar in both estuarine systems (in the range 0.1 (acetaminophen) to 17 (4-hydroxyacetophenone) ng/g dry weight). Despite their variable reported Log K-ow values (from ca. 0.5 to > 7), the ECs are all apparently mobile in the marsh systems studied, and where subsurface concentration maxima are present these most likely relate to local flushing or diffusive processes and cannot be clearly linked to likely input trends or changes in sediment geochemistry (including sedimentary organic carbon content). The "estuarine filter" here, at least with respect to intertidal saltmarsh sediments, shows reduced potential to sequester the seven ECs examined and mediate their supply to coastal and shelf environments.

TI  - Ecological response of nitrification to oil spills and its impact on the nitrogen cycle
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine oil spills are catastrophic events that cause massive damage to ecosystems at all trophic levels. While most of the research has focused on carbon-degrading microorganisms, the potential impacts of hydrocarbons on microbes responsible for nitrification have received far less attention. Nitrifiers are sensitive to hydrocarbon toxicity: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea being 100 and 1000 times more sensitive than typical heterotrophs respectively. Field studies have demonstrated the response of nitrifiers to hydrocarbons is highly variable and the loss of nitrification activity in coastal ecosystems can be restored within 1-2 years, which is much shorter than the typical recovery time of whole ecosystems (e.g., up to 20 years). Since the denitrification process is mainly driven by heterotrophs, which are more resistant to hydrocarbon toxicity than nitrifiers, the inhibition of nitrification may slow down the nitrogen turnover and increase ammonia availability, which supports the growth of oil-degrading heterotrophs and possibly various phototrophs. A better understanding of the ecological response of nitrification is paramount in predicting impacts of oil spills on the nitrogen cycle under oil spill conditions, and in improving current bioremediation practices.

TI  - Characteristics of soil organic carbon and its isotopic compositions
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the data of soil organic carbon (SOC) content and its isotopic compositions (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) in three drilling cores at typical elevations at the Chongmingdongtan salt marsh of Yangtze River Estuary and in six profiles at different altitudes in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, the characteristics of SOC content and its isotopic compositions during the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) were investigated. The results indicated that SOC contents and. delta C-13 values were negatively correlated in the soil sections above the depth with maximum delta C-13 ( delta(13) C-max), and positively correlated below this depth. The negative correlation indicated that SOM reduction degree was low, and the rapid turnover compartments were in greater proportions of SOM which were fresh organic matters in the upper soil sections with SOM apparent (14) C ages less than 200 years. The positive correlation was in adverse, and the SOM apparent (14) C ages were usually over 300 years. The degradation rate of SOC was negatively correlated with pedogenesis ages, and remarkably lower below the soil depth with delta(13) C-max than above the depth. The greater the pedogenesis age, the less the decreasing rate of SOC content with time, suggesting that the SOM was mainly of slow turnover compartments. The temporal changes of delta(13) C values in different soil profiles showed similar tendency, 1. e., the VC values above the soil depth with delta C-13(max), increased with time, while those below this depth were in adverse, which correlated well with the temporal changes of SOC contents, due to the distribution of different SOM compartments with soil depth.

TI  - DESCRIPTION OF DARK CHESTNUT COLOWRED ALKALINE SOILS IN "AK-KAJIN" FOREST NURSERY
T2  - Agrarnyi vestnik Urala
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the chemical and physical showings of hard damped dark chestnut colored alkaline soils in “Ak-Kajin” forest nursery. On the basis of zoning this territory refers to the steppe zone, subzone of dry fescue-feather grass steppe. At it is noted the soils in the forest nursery are highly alkaline. This is due to heavy mechanical composition of above mentioned soil and repeated destruction of alkaline horizon by agricultural machinery. To restore these soils fertility by ordinary agronomical methods and application of mineral as well as organic fertilizers is impossible. Specific measures are required for cardinal reconstruction. In dry seasons as a result of shrinkage cracks are formed. These cracks are filled with surface horizon (layer) substances (materials). When the soils are moisture the cracks are compressed and the “unnecessary” material in the profile layer part creates pressure that leads to displacement of soil blocks and this in its turn gives rise to formation of sliding surfaces as well as micro relief “gilgay” formation. As concerns СО content and aqueous extract of alkalinity level dark chestnut soils in «Ak-Kajin» forest nursery do not differ significantly from zone dark chestnut soils and as concerns the degree of alkalinity and salinity degree - from tidal marshes. The dark chestnut soils of low-power and low humus significantly increases the negative impact of alkalinity in the silvicultural properties of soils. The potential fertility of the soil: by organic matter content they are low-supplied, within 1.5-2.7 %, due to the predominance of the process of alkaline hydrolysis (pH 8.4-8.75) and removal of organic elements with grown planting material. The area of forest nursery “Ak-Kajin” needs in the development and implementation of technology of making soil non-alkaline and fertility improvement, providing a change of physical and chemical properties of the latter to the level of the possibility of growing planting material

TI  - Major role of marine vegetation on the oceanic carbon cycle
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon burial in vegetated sediments, ignored in past assessments of carbon burial in the ocean, was evaluated using a bottom-up approach derived from upscaling a compilation of published individual estimates of carbon burial in vegetated habitats (seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangrove forests) to the global level and a top-down approach derived from considerations of global sediment balance and a compilation of the organic carbon content of vegeatated sediments. Up-scaling of individual burial estimates values yielded a total carbon burial in vegetated habitats of 111 Tmol C y(-1). The total burial in unvegetated sediments was estimated to be 126 Tg C y(-1), resulting in a bottom-up estimate of total burial in the ocean of about 244 Tg C y(-1), two-fold higher than estimates of oceanic carbon burial that presently enter global carbon budgets. The organic carbon concentrations in vegetated marine sediments exceeds by 2 to 10-fold those in shelf/deltaic sediments. Top-down recalculation of ocean sediment budgets to account for these, previously neglected, organic-rich sediments, yields a top-down carbon burial estimate of 216 Tg C y(-1), with vegetated coastal habitats contributing about 50%. Even though vegetated carbon burial contributes about half of the total carbon burial in the ocean, burial represents a small fraction of the net production of these ecosystems, estimated at about 3388 Tg C y(-1), suggesting that bulk of the benthic net ecosystem production must support excess respiration in other compartments, such as unvegetated sediments and the coastal pelagic compartment. The total excess organic carbon available to be exported to the ocean is estimated at between 1126 to 3534 Tg C y(-1), the bulk of which must be respired in the open ocean. Widespread loss of vegetated coastal habitats must have reduced carbon burial in the ocean by about 30 Tg Cy-1, identifying the destruction of these ecosystems as an important loss of CO2 sink capacity in the biosphere.

TI  - Changes in water quality following opening and closure of a bar-built estuary (Pescadero, California)
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bar-built estuaries are coastal environments characterized by the partial closure of the estuary's mouth with a sandbar barrier for extended periods (closed state). Through natural events (rainfall) or anthropogenic influences, the sandbar is breached, reopening the estuary to the ocean. The transition from closed to open state often leads to extensive physical and chemical changes in the estuarine conditions, as water mixing and sediment resuspension are increased, which could result in the oxidation of sediment acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). We followed monthly changes in water's and sediment geochemical characteristics at thirty-two sites spanning the Pescadero Estuary over a one-year period. We showed that the transition from closed to open state leads to significant decreases in aqueous pH to circumneutral values and significant increases in aqueous hydrogen sulfide and iron concentrations to 10.6 mu M and 59.1 mu M, respectively, due to sediment AVS oxidation following sediment resuspension. Aqueous hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in both closed and open states were significantly higher than the recommended thresholds for aquatic life. Moreover, mildly acidic water conditions in the open state were lower than the recommended limits for aquatic life. Our spatial analysis further highlighted that some parts of the estuary were more vulnerable to decreased water quality. Indeed, high sediment AVS contents (19-24 mmol kg(-1)) were observed year-round at the River Confluence and Butano Creek regions, which implies a high potential for severe water acidification and metal release when the estuary transitions from closed to open state.

TI  - SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE STOMACH CONTENTS OF THE BURROWING MUD-CRAB HELICE-TRIDENS DE HAAN
T2  - Bulletin of the Marine Biological Station of Asamushi
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated seasonal changes in the feeding activity of the mud crab Helice tridens (De Haan). In early summer, from June to July, feeding activity was low, and the stomach contents contained a large amount of inorganic matter, suggesting that the crabs fed mainly upon surface soil. These results may be related to copulation behaviour, since the crabs are associated closely with their burrows. In contrast, in the wandering season in early fall, the organic matter fraction of the  stomach contents was clearly high compared with other months, strongly suggesting that the crabs fed directly on plants and/or animals. This change in food sources in early fall was supported by observations that many large crabs wandered around in the lagoon and creek in front of the salt marsh habitat, because organisms suitable for food were abundant there. From fall to early winter, stomach fullness was at its highest. The increase in feeding activity in this season may be related to life  style, since the crabs pass the winter in their burrows.

TI  - Short- and Long-Term Response of Deteriorating Brackish Marshes and Open-Water Ponds to Sediment Enhancement by Thin-Layer Dredge Disposal
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial sediment enhancement using a thin layer of dredged material has been suggested as a means to increase elevation and create soil conditions conducive to increased marsh structure and function in deteriorating marshes. Using a chronosequence approach, we examined the effects of sediment enhancement in deteriorating marsh and open-water pond habitats located in six brackish marshes. Sediment enhancement of both marsh and interior pond sites had significant, immediate, and long-lasting effects on physical soil properties and nutrient status with increased bulk density and inorganic nitrogen. Vegetative cover and productivity response were minimal for deteriorating vegetated marshes with the short-term response data showing no significant impact of sediment enhancement and long-term trends indicating decreasing productivity over time. In contrast, trajectory models of vegetative cover and productivity in interior pond sites showed increases over time indicating that, for restoration of interior ponds, sediment enhancement may prove valuable. The use of trajectory models emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring to determine restoration success of projects.

TI  - MICROBIAL-DEGRADATION OF METHANESULFONIC-ACID - A MISSING LINK IN THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL SULFUR CYCLE
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - ATMOSPHERIC dimethyl sulphide, arising from marine algae, cyanobacteria and salt marsh plants such as Spartina, is the principal sulphur compound entering the atmosphere from terrestrial and aquatic environments 1-6. Methanesulphonic acid (CH3SO3H; MSA) has been identified as a major product of the photochemical oxidation in the atmosphere of dimethyl sulphide 1-3, 5, 7-9. Dimethyl sulphide and MSA are thus predominantly, if not exclusively, biogenic in origin, and are the main gaseous links in the biogeochemical sulphur cycle. MSA is a stable compound, not undergoing photochemical decomposition 3, so its removal from the atmosphere is by wet and dry deposition. MSA partitions into the aerosol phase, as well as nucleating droplet formation, and is deposited in rain and snow. Analysis of Antarctic ice cores 10 gives evidence of its global deposition over many thousands of years. The subsequent fate of MSA deposited on land was unknown. Here we describe terrestrial bacteria that grow on MSA. Their activities in the natural environment would result in the mineralization of MSA to carbon dioxide and sulphate, thus completing our understanding of this part of the sulphur cycle.

TI  - Tracking wetland restoration: Do mitigation sites follow desired trajectories?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypothetical models in the scientific literature suggest that ecosystem restoration and creation sites follow a smooth path of development (called a trajectory), rapidly matching natural reference sites (the target). Multi-million-dollar mitigation agreements have been based on the expectation that damages to habitat will be compensated within 5-10 years, and monitoring periods have been set accordingly. Our San Diego Bay study site, the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, has one of the longest and most detailed records of habitat development at a mitigation site: data on soil organic matter, soil nitrogen, plant growth, and plant canopies for up to 10 years from a 12-year-old site. High interannual variation and lack of directional changes indicate little chance that targets will be reached in the near future. Other papers perpetuate the trajectory model, despite data that corroborate our findings. After reviewing "trajectory models" and presenting our comprehensive data for the first time, we suggest alternative management and mitigation policies.

TI  - Geochemical Characteristics of Soil C, N, P, and Their Stoichiometrical Significance in the Coastal Wetlands of Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the variations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) with depth in coastal wetlands of Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea. Generally, average contents of SOC and TN were higher at tidal flooding Guangrao wetland (GRA) than those at Changyi (CY) wetland where the tidal can rarely reached. Among the five profiles, higher variations of SOC and TN were observed in CYB1 and CYB2, where the TP contents showed lower variations. SOC showed a rapid decrease with depth in CYB1 and CYB2, whereas they tended to increase with depth in GRA1 and GRA2. Vertical distributions of TN were significantly correlated with SOC in profile GRA1, CYB1, and CYB2. However, no clear trend was found on the vertical variations of TP. Additionally, C, N, and P ecological stoichiometry in these two coastal wetlands had high complexities within wetland. The C/N ratios were generally higher, while the C/P ratios and the N/P ratios were comparatively low, indicating the coastal wetland biogeochemical processes were more limited by N and P, with the former may being the primary factor. Our results also indicated that both vegetation coverage and tidal flooding were important in the biogeochemical processes of these coastal wetlands.

AB  - Despite its significance in understanding ecological structure and biogeochemical element cycles,there have been few studies on the microbial mineralization of organic matter and mineralizationpathway in the intertidal flat of Korea. We measured anaerobic mineralization of organic matter andsulfate reduction rate, and evaluated the significance of sulfa te reduction in total anaerobic carbonrespiration at the southern part of Ganghwa Island. Depth-integ rated carbon mineralization ratedown to 6 cm depth ranged from 41.9 to 89.4 mmol m-2 d-1, which accounted for approximately 216tons of organic matter mineralization in entire intertidal flat area of Ganghwa(300 km2). The resultsindicated that capacity for the organic matter mineralization i n the Ganghwa tidal flat iscomparable to highly productive salt marsh environments. Minera lization rates in the sedimentamended with acetate were 2~5 times higher than in unamended se diment. The results implied thatmicrobial mineralization was limited by the availability of org anic substrates, and the organicmatter mineralization capacity seems to be higher than estimate d at ambient organic substratelevel. Depth-integrated sulfate reduction rates within 6 cm dep th of the sediment ranged from 20.7to 45.1 mmol SO 42- m-2 d-1, and sulfate reduction was mostly responsible for organic matt erremineralization. It should be noticed that the increase of H 2S in the sulfate reduction dominatedtidal flat may result in the decrease of biological diversity.

TI  - Assessing delta C-13 and C/N ratios from organic material in archived cores as Holocene sea level and palaeoenvironmental indicators in the Humber Estuary, UK
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic delta C-13 and C/N analyses of estuarine deposits provide proxies for changes in the source of organic matter, which can be driven by fluctuations in relative sea level, river discharge, and catchment disturbance. Here we present the results of a comprehensive vegetation and sediment delta C-13 and C/N survey of Welwich Marsh (outer Humber Estuary, UK), together with high-resolution delta C-13 and C/N analyses of Holocene cores collected nine years previously from the Humber Estuary and the Lincolnshire Marshes, Eastern England, UK. The contemporary intertidal delta C-13 and C/N dataset shows a gradual increase in surface sediment delta C-13 with decreasing marsh height and suggests that delta C-13 is controlled by the degree of tidal inundation and thus reflects organic matter source. However, sediment C/N ratios are less sensitive to tidal changes and the recent introduction Of C-4 salt-marsh species complicates the contemporary analogue. The Holocene delta C-13 and C/N records are in general agreement with existing microfossil data and provide additional palacoenvironmental information. This includes support for an estuary-wide expansion of marine conditions from c. 3.3 ka cal. yr BP, followed by a contraction of marine conditions after c. 2.7 ka cal. yr BP, and evidence for an increase in delivery of terrigenous organic matter to the inner estuary in the late Holocene. Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis is shown to be a reliable and independent indicator of coastal environmental change and is therefore a complementary technique to the more commonly used microfossil approach. However, this study also shows that in some circumstances the technique may be compromised when applied to sediments from cores that have been stored for a period of time.

TI  - Short-Term Study on Variations of Carbon Dioxide and Methane Emissions from Intertidal Zone of the Yellow River Estuary during Autumn and Winter
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the spatial and temporal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions and determine the key environmental factors influencing their fluxes across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary (China), short-term measurements were conducted in intertidal zone in autumn and winter during 2011-2012. Results showed that mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their cumulative emissions indicated intertidal zone of the examined marshes as strong CO2 source and weak CH4 sink over all sampling seasons with values of 34.35 mgCO(2)m(-2)h(-1) and -0.0084 mgCH(4)m(-2)h(-1) and 804.21 gCO(2)m(-2) and -198.85 mgCH(4)m(-2), respectively. Temporal variations of CO2 emission were strongly correlated with air and sediment temperatures, while spatial variations were mainly affected by vegetation composition at spatial scale. The freeze/thaw cycles in sediments during early winter and midwinter were one of main factors influencing the temporal variations of CH4 emission, while the concentrations of sulfate might greatly influence the spatial variation of CH4 fluxes. Next step, to assess the CO2 and CH4 inventory precisely during autumn and winter, the potential effects of exogenous nutrient loading on their emissions from intertidal zone of the Yellow River estuary should be emphasized and the long-term studies should be conducted.

TI  - Diel cycles of sulphate reduction rates in sediments of a Zostera marina bed (Denmark)
T2  - AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulphate reduction was investigated over 24 h cycles in Zostera marina-bearing sediments. The experiments were carried out at the beginning (April) and end (August) of the growing season of the eelgrass. The sulphate reduction rates were 3 times higher in August (similar to 90 mmol SO42- m(-2) d(-1)) than in April. In both periods, the sulphate reduction rates were significantly higher in the light than in the dark. The stimulation in the light may be due to increased root exudation of organic matter related to photosynthetic activity. The exuded organic carbon accounted for approximately 2 to 4% of the total amount of carbon fixed by the plants. The sulphate reduction rates responded rapidly to shifts from dark to light and vice versa, indicating the presence of a limited pool of labile organic matter in the sediment. A positive correlation between sulphate reduction rates and root+rhizome biomass was observed in April and August during the daytime and in August but not April in the dark.

TI  - Porewater inputs drive Fe redox cycling in the water column of a temperate mangrove wetland
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron is a vital micronutrient within coastal marine ecosystems, playing an integral role in the scale and dynamics of primary production and carbon cycling in the world's oceans. We investigated the relative importance of in situ Fe(II) production from photochemical, microbial and thermal Fe reduction in the surface water column as well as advective porewater inputs in a temperate saline wetland in Australia containing mangrove and salt-marsh vegetation. The diel average concentration of Fe(II) (0.63 +/- 0.21 mu M, accounting for > 70% of the total dissolved Fe present in surface water) was much higher than commonly reported in oxygenated marine waters despite high dissolved oxygen concentrations (81-112% saturation), pH (7.7-7.8) and salinity (33-36) that favor Fe oxidation. In situ production of Fe(II) in the surface water column was primarily driven by microbial processes rather than photochemical and thermal reduction, with a maximum production rate of 4.9 x 10(-3) nM s(-1). Advective porewater Fe(II) inputs to the wetland averaged over a diel cycle (3.0 x 10(-1) nM s(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the combined Fe(II) production rate from autochthonous water column processes (1.0 x 10(-2) nM s(-1)). A bottom up model based on the estimated individual fluxes was used to explain the high Fe(II) concentrations measured during a 24 h time series experiment. Combined, different lines of evidence suggest that advective porewater exchange provides significant quantities of Fe(II) to the estuarine wetland.

TI  - REMOVAL OF FUNGAL AND TOTAL ORGANIC-MATTER FROM DECAYING CORDGRASS LEAVES BY SHREDDER SNAILS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several lines of evidence from the literature have pointed to the saltmarsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata [Say]) as a potentially important shredder of standing, decaying cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) shoots. Periwinkles prefer to ingest dead-shoot material and possess enzymes capable of lysis of cordgrass plant-structural and fungal-wall polymers. We offered natural, standing-dead leaf blades to periwinkles in an attempt to determine the rates at which the snails would rasp away and ingest material of the decaying-shoot system, and whether the snails would selectively remove living-fungal mass (measured as ergosterol) from the system. The larger snails tested (14 mm shell height) took 42% of the total organic mass of the blades during 6 days of exposure, and exhibited selectivity for fungal-occupied portions of blades by removing 69% of the living-fungal organic mass. Based on observed removal rates, about 2-3%.  day-1 of the organic mass of standing-dead leaf blades could be lost to snail grazing in marsh areas where the snails are most densely concentrated (> 400 individuals . m-2 of shell length > 5 mm). In a preliminary comparison of adjacent marsh areas of equivalent canopy height, the one without periwinkles had a 4 x greater standing crop of dead leaves. Periwinkles are likely to be important controlling agents of fungal standing crops and important shapers of fungal community dynamics in cordgrass marshes, in that the standing, decaying substratum for fungal growth and the potential for fungal species successions are radically changed by the snails' activities.

TI  - How will climate change affect plant-herbivore interactions? A tropical waterbird case study
T2  - EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - We review interactions between waterfowl and wetlands and outline the shifts that are likely to occur within these relationships through global climate change. We highlight the relative paucity of research on populations of tropical waterfowl and their food plants, and use an iconic tropical species of waterfowl, the Magpie Goose (Anseranas semipalmata), as a case study. We provide background on the known and hypothesised interactions between Magpie Geese and wetlands and provide a hypothetical framework of the mechanistic changes to these relationships through climatic change, including rises in sea level, temperature increases, elevated CO2 levels and altered rainfall regimes. Intrusion of saline water through sea-level rise and extended periods of inundation following increased annual rainfall are the two plausible drivers of change in the wetland sedge plants that support Magpie Geese populations. We show how the relative importance of these, and other, threatening factors can be challenged with data from the field and laboratory under multiple working hypotheses. Understanding the imminent shifts in the structure of wetland plant communities and the likely response of waterfowl populations will focus management on key threats and critical habitat. This includes identification of important wetlands and the construction of buffers at them to slow salt-water intrusion.

TI  - Biogeochemistry of pyrite and iron sulfide oxidation in marine sediments
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrite (FeS2) and iron monosulfide (FeS) play a central role in the sulfur and iron cycles of marine sediments, They may be buried in the sediment or oxidized by O-2 after transport by bioturbation to the sediment surface. FeS2 and FeS may also be oxidized within the anoxic sediment in which NO3-, Fe(III) oxides, or MnO2 are available as potential electron acceptors. In chemical experiments, FeS2 and FeS were oxidized by MnO2 but not with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide (Schippers and Jorgensen, 2001). Here we also show that in experiments with anoxic sediment slurries, a dissolution of tracer-marked (FeS2)-Fe-55 occurred with MnO2 but not with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide as electron acceptor. To study a thermodynamically possible anaerobic microbial FeS, and FeS oxidation with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide as electron acceptor, more than 300 assays were inoculated with material from several marine sediments and incubated at different temperatures for > 1 yr. Bacteria could not be enriched with FeS2 as substrate or with FeS and amorphous Fe(III) oxide. With FeS and NO3-, 14 enrichments were obtained. One of these enrichments was further cultivated anaerobically with Fe2+ and S-0 as substrates and NO3- as electron acceptor, in the presence of (FeS2)-Fe-55, to test for co-oxidation of FeS2, but an anaerobic microbial dissolution of (FeS2)-Fe-55, could not been detected. FeS2 and FeS were not oxidized by amorphous Fe(III) oxide in the presence of Fe-complexing organic compounds in a carbonate-buffered solution at pH R. Despite many different experiments, an anaerobic microbial dissolution of FeS2 could not be detected; thus, we conclude that this process does not have a significant role in marine sediments. FeS can be oxidized microbially with NO3-, as electron acceptor. O-2 and MnO2, but not NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide, are chemical oxidants for both FeS2 and FeS.

TI  - Remotely-Sensed Indicators of N-Related Biomass Allocation in Schoenoplectus acutus
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root:shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, 549 was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root:shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Deriving LAI of Salt Marsh Vegetation Using Structure From Motion and Multiangular Spectra
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a structural parameter that plays a major role in modeling the exchange of energy, carbon dioxide, water, and other matter between plants and their surrounding environment. Direct means of measuring LAI are time-intensive and laborious, making indirect LAI retrieval methods desirable. In this study, we developed a method for retrieving structural metrics of erectophile plants that relies on open-source structure from motion software. We achieved this using a novel goniometer system to simultaneously retrieve high-resolution digital imagery and bidirectional spectroscopy measurements of Spartina alterniflora in a laboratory environment during both peak and late growing season. Retrieved LAI metrics correlated well with directional measurements of the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index 2 (MCARI2). Across all planting densities, the magnitude of the MCARI2 exhibited a high degree of variance, which depended on sensor viewing angle. MCARI2 values in the peak growing season were significantly higher. This result suggests that the MCARI2 metric is sensitive to seasonal changes in plant growth and senescence. We observed a high correlation between the LAI(contac)t values and the Total MCARI2 metric for the peak growth state plantings of R-2 = 0.9, suggesting that summing multiple directional measurements of MCARI2 potentially provides a more accurate assessment of LAI and compensates for observed variance in MCARI2 as a function of sensor orientation. Future work will focus on validating the observed effects across a broader range of plant species.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability in ammonia oxidation and ammonia-oxidising bacteria and archaea in coastal sediments of the western English Channel
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance of ammonia-oxidising bacterial (AOB) and ammonia-oxidising archaeal (AOA) (amoA) genes and ammonia oxidation rates were compared bimonthly from July 2008 to May 2011 in 4 contrasting coastal sediments in the western English Channel. Despite a higher abundance of AOA amoA genes within all sediments and at all time-points, rates of ammonia oxidation correlated with AOB and not AOA amoA gene abundance. Sediment type was a major factor in determining both AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB community structure, possibly due to deeper oxygen penetration into the sandier sediments, increasing the area available for ammonia oxidation. Decreases in AOB amoA gene abundance were evident during summer and autumn, with maximum abundance and ammonia oxidation rates occurring in winter and early spring. PCR-DGGE of AOB amoA genes indicated that no seasonal changes to community composition occurred; however, a gradual movement in community composition occurred at 3 of the sites studied. The lack of correlation between AOA amoA gene abundance and ammonium oxidation rates, or any other environmental variable measured, may be related to the higher spatial variation amongst measurements, obscuring temporal trends, or the bimonthly sampling, which may have been too infrequent to capture temporal variability in the deposition of fresh organic matter. Alternatively, AOA may respond to changing substrate concentrations by an increase or decrease in transcript rather than gene abundance.

TI  - Surface and SubSurface Soil Organic Matter Processing following Hurricane Harvey, Texas, USA
T2  - Environmental Data Initiative
M3  - Data set
AB  - Coastal wetland plant identity and cover is changing, as many subtropical salt marshes dominated by low-stature herbaceous species transition to woody mangroves. How changes in dominant plant species affect carbon processing in coastal wetlands during storms is uncertain. We experimentally manipulated patch-scale (3 * 3 m) cover of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh plants (e.g., Spartina alterniflora, Batis maritima) in fringe and interior locations of ten plots (24 * 42 m) to create a gradient in mangrove cover in coastal Texas, USA. Hurricane Harvey made direct landfall over our site on 25 August 2017. To test how mangrove cover affected carbon retention after the storm, we measured litter breakdown rates (k) of A. germinans and S. alterniflora in surface soils and fast- and slow-decomposing standard litter substrates (green and red tea, respectively) in subsurface soils (15 cm depth). Soil temperatures were lower in mangrove than marsh patches, and prior microclimate measurements showed non-linear increases in air and soil temperatures with increasing mangrove cover (highest temperatures at intermediate % cover). Litter breakdown rates (k) were 2 higher in surface than in subsurface soils. Avicennia germinans litter k increased linearly in surface soils with plot-level mangrove cover, whereas slow-decomposing red tea had similar k in subsurface soils of all plots. Litter k of S. alterniflora in surface soils and fast-decomposing green tea in subsurface soils increased non-linearly with mangrove cover (highest k at intermediate % cover), explained largely by temperature. Microbial respiration rates (R) were highest in interior marsh patches for S. alterniflora litter and increased with plot-level mangrove cover, whereas R associated with A. germinans litter was similar among fringe and interior patches and highest at higher mangrove cover. Despite widespread declines in soil nutrient concentrations throughout marsh and mangrove patches in all plots, most surface and subsurface rates of carbon processing increased with mangrove cover in coastal wetlands following a hurricane.

TI  - Organic substrate quality as the link between bacterioplankton carbon demand and growth efficiency in a temperate salt-marsh estuary
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterioplankton communities play a key role in aquatic carbon cycling, specifically with respect to the magnitude of organic carbon processed and partitioning of this carbon into biomass and respiratory losses. Studies of bacterioplankton carbon demand (BCD) and growth efficiency (BGE) frequently report higher values in more productive systems, suggesting these aspects of carbon metabolism may be positively coupled. However, the existence of such a relationship in natural aquatic systems has yet to be identified. Using a comprehensive 2-year study of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism in a temperate estuary, we investigated BCD and BGE and explored factors that may modulate their magnitude and coherence, including nutrient concentrations, dissolved nutrient uptake and source and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). During the course of our study, BCD ranged from 0.4 to 15.9 mu g l(-1) h(-1), with an overall mean of 3.8 mu g l(-1) h(-1). Mean BGE was similar to that reported for other estuarine systems (0.32) and of comparable range (that is, 0.06 - 0.68). Initial analyses identified a negative correlation between BCD and BGE, yet removal of the effect of temperature revealed an underlying positive coupling that was also correlated with long-term DOC lability. Whereas BCD was weakly related to ambient DOC concentrations, neither BCD nor BGE showed any relationship with ambient nutrient concentrations or nutrient uptake stoichiometries. We conclude that in this carbon-rich estuary, organic matter source and quality play an important role in regulating the magnitude of carbon metabolism and may be more important than nutrient availability alone in the regulation of BGE.

TI  - Patterns of spatial and temporal distribution of the macrobenthic fauna on an estuarine macrotidal sandy beach on the Amazon coast (Brazil)
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several attempts have been made to find universal zonation schemes for the benthic fauna in sandy beaches. Usually, the nature and number of zones are not fixed and depend on the beach type and temporal changes in environmental characteristics. We characterized spatial and temporal variations in the structure of macrobenthic communities on an Amazonian macrotidal sandy beach (Farol Beach, Algodoal-Maiandeua Island, Brazil). Samples (macrobenthos and sediments) were collected during the rainy (March 2012 and 2013) and dry seasons (September 2011 and 2012) at six equidistant sites (50 m apart) from the high tide water mark to the swash zone. The physical gradients influenced the faunal distribution, with significant seasonal variations. Density and diversity increased seaward, while increasing moisture, organic matter content, and fine grains in sediments. Two faunal zonation schemes were observed. In the dry season, three faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal, mid-intertidal, and low-intertidal, whereas in the rainy season, only two faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal and low-intertidal. In the rainy season, the physical gradients along the intertidal appeared to be smooth, allowing the expansion of the upper-tidal zone. This study provides novel insights into macrobenthic distribution patterns, reinforcing that tropical macrotidal beaches have unique characteristics that strongly influence macrobenthic distribution patterns.

TI  - Impact of mariculture on microbial diversity in sediments near open ocean farming of Polydactylus sexfilis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A chemical and microbiological investigation was performed to determine ecological impact in sediments below a new offshore mariculture operation on the southwest coast of Oahu, Hawaii. Sediment samples collected directly below the fish enclosures were compared with sediment collected 300 m upcurrent. Total organic carbon was 25-37% higher in the control compared with cage samples and ammonia was 30-46% higher in cage samples. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) counts were 36% higher in cage sample sediments.Genomic 16S rDNA was PCR amplified from total DNA extracted from sediments and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Similar gradient profiles for control and cage samples were observed. Cloned 16S rDNA libraries for species sampling and determination indicate similar and diverse bacterial communities. Bacteria belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria class were frequently represented and atypical or pathogenic bacterial species were not detected.A mathematical model developed for prediction of organic material deposition suggests that while currents will reduce fecal loading and feed deposition beneath a cage, there is expected to be sufficient nutrient addition to impact those sediments. Time series or statistical information on the current field beneath the fish cages are needed to apply the model for predicting locations of high deposition. This would contribute to the development of a comprehensive monitoring program that would sample multiple locations over time to generate an accurate and comprehensive depiction of the environmental impacts of this new and expanding commercial endeavor.

TI  - Preliminary insights into magneto-biomonitoring (Tilia europaea and Acer pseudoplatanus) as an alternative roadside particulate air pollution technology
T2  - AIR POLLUTION XIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution
CL  - Wessex Inst Technol, New Forest, ENGLAND
AB  - Urban roadside particulate air pollution, deposited on tree leaf surfaces (Lime: Tilia europaea; Sycamore: Acer pseudoplatanus), has been monitored (July 2003 to November 2003) by mineral magnetic technologies. The nature of this work is particularly important because particulate pollution affects human health (i.e. cardio-vascular and respiratory systems). Leaves were collected from four roadside locations and a woodland park within the City of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, U.K. Data analyses reveal that significant (p < 0.001) site-specific differences are chiefly attributed to differences in types of traffic management and associated vehicular behaviour, but may also be influenced by the type of vehicular engine (notably diesel) and localised conditions. Moreover, evidence suggests magnetic concentration parameters are a surrogate for particulate air pollution. Given the speed, measurement sensitivity and non-destructive nature of the technique, it is proposed this low-cost approach offers some advantages over other technologies currently used to monitor urban roadside particulate pollution.

TI  - Short-term C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora invasions change the soil carbon in C-3 plant-dominated tidal wetlands on a growing estuarine Island
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora is an invasive C-4 perennial grass, native to North America, and has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

TI  - Sulfur Cycling in an Iron Oxide-Dominated, Dynamic Marine Depositional System: The Argentine Continental Margin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interplay between sediment deposition patterns, organic matter type and the quantity and quality of reactive mineral phases determines the accumulation, speciation, and isotope composition of pore water and solid phase sulfur constituents in marine sediments. Here, we present the sulfur geochemistry of siliciclastic sediments from two sites along the Argentine continental slope-a system characterized by dynamic deposition and reworking, which result in non-steady state conditions. The two investigated sites have different depositional histories but have in common that reactive iron phases are abundant and that organic matter is refractory-conditions that result in low organoclastic sulfate reduction rates (SRR). Deposition of reworked, isotopically light pyrite and sulfurized organic matter appear to be important contributors to the sulfur inventory, with only minor addition of pyrite from organoclastic sulfate reduction above the sulfate-methane transition (SMT). Pore-water sulfide is limited to a narrow zone at the SMT. The core of that zone is dominated by pyrite accumulation. Iron monosulfide and elemental sulfur accumulate above and below this zone. Iron monosulfide precipitation is driven by the reaction of low amounts of hydrogen sulfide with ferrous iron and is in competition with the oxidation of sulfide by iron (oxyhydr) oxides to form elemental sulfur. The intervals marked by precipitation of intermediate sulfur phases at the margin of the zone with free sulfide are bordered by two distinct peaks in total organic sulfur (TOS). Organic matter sulfurization appears to precede pyrite formation in the iron-dominated margins of the sulfide zone, potentially linked to the presence of polysulfides formed by reaction between dissolved sulfide and elemental sulfur. Thus, SMTs can be hotspots for organic matter sulfurization in sulfide-limited, reactive iron-rich marine sedimentary systems. Furthermore, existence of elemental sulfur and iron monosulfide phases meters below the SMT demonstrates that in sulfide-limited systems metastable sulfur constituents are not readily converted to pyrite but can be buried to deeper sediment depths. Our data show that in non-steady state systems, redox zones do not occur in sequence but can reappear or proceed in inverse sequence throughout the sediment column, causing similar mineral alteration processes to occur at the same time at different sediment depths.

TI  - Salinity tolerances of three succulent halophytes (Tecticornia spp.) differentially distributed along a salinity gradient
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated tolerances to salinity (10-2000mM NaCl) in three halophytic succulent Tecticornia species that are differentially distributed along a salinity gradient at an ephemeral salt lake. The three species showed similar relative shoot and root growth rates at 10-1200mM NaCl; at 2000mM NaCl, T. indica subsp. bidens (Nees) K.A.Sheph and P.G.Wilson died, but T. medusa (K.A.Sheph and S.J.van Leeuwen) and T. auriculata (P.G.Wilson) K.A.Sheph and P.G.Wilson survived but showed highly diminished growth rates and were at incipient water stress. The mechanisms of salinity tolerance did not differ among the three species and involved the osmotic adjustment of succulent shoot tissues by the accumulation of Na+, Cl- and the compatible solute glycinebetaine, and the maintenance of high net K+ to Na+ selectivity to the shoot. Growth at extreme salinity was presumably limited by the capacity for vacuolar Na+ and Cl- uptake to provide sufficiently low tissue osmotic potentials for turgor-driven growth. Tissue sugar concentrations were not reduced at high salinity, suggesting that declines in growth would not have been caused by inadequate photosynthesis and substrate limitation compared with plants at low salinity. Equable salt tolerance among the three species up to 1200mM NaCl means that other factors are likely to contribute to species composition at sites with salinities below this level. The lower NaCl tolerance threshold for survival in T. indica suggests that this species would be competitively inferior to T. medusa and T. auriculata in extremely saline soils.

TI  - Salt Marsh Primary Production and Its Responses to Relative Sea Level and Nutrients in Estuaries at Plum Island, Massachusetts, and North Inlet, South Carolina, USA
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Feedbacks between flooding and plant growth that help to stabilize marshes against rising sea level are being investigated in estuaries at Plum Island, Massachusetts, and North Inlet, South Carolina. Net annual primary production of the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora has been quite variable through the years, and correlates positively with sea level during the growing season at both sites. The elevation of the marsh surface relative to mean high water determines the duration of flooding, or hydroperiod, that in turn affects plant growth. The effect of flooding was tested experimentally using an in situ bioassay to simulate growth at different relative elevations. At North Inlet, we found a parabolic response to relative elevation, with clear evidence of minimum and maximum vertical limits and an optimal elevation for growth. The Plum Island bioassay provided evidence of the super-optimal side of the growth curve. In both marshes, the responses of S. alterniflora to rising sea level, at their current elevations, are consistent with the bioassay results. This growth curve is important because it defines suboptimal elevations that are unstable for marshes and super-optimal elevations that are stable. Instability results when an increase in sea level decreases primary production, leading to declines in mineral sedimentation and sediment organic matter accretion. Conversely, stability results when rising sea level stimulates primary production, leading to increased sedimentation and organic matter accretion. There also has been interannual variability in the maximum standing biomass (a proxy for productivity) of another marsh grass, Spartina patens, but no significant correlation has been found with sea level, possibly due to methodological limitations. Finally, both Spartina species responded positively to nitrogen and have remained highly productive for 13 years of fertilization at Plum Island and 30 years at North Inlet.

TI  - Depositional environment of mudflats and mangroves and bioavailability of selected metals within mudflats in a tropical estuary
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Four sediment cores representing adjacent mudflat and mangrove sub-environments of middle estuary (Shastri) were analyzed for sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon. Total metal concentration of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and lead (Pb) and chemical speciation of Fe, Mn, and Co on selected samples was also carried out on mudflat cores. The sediments in the upper middle estuary were found to be deposited under highly varying hydrodynamic energy conditions; whereas lower middle estuary experienced relatively stable hydrodynamic energy conditions with time. The tributary joining the river near the upper middle estuary is found to be responsible for the addition of enhanced organic carbon and metal concentrations. Speciation study indicated Fe and Co are from natural lithogenic origin while Mn is derived from anthropogenic sources. Higher Mn and Co than apparent effects threshold can pose a high risk of toxicity to organisms associated with these sediments.

TI  - Synergic effect of salinity and zinc stress on growth and photosynthetic responses of the cordgrass, Spartina densiflora
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina densiflora is a C-4 halophytic species that has proved to have a high invasive potential which derives from its physiological plasticity to environmental factors, such as salinity. It is found in coastal marshes of south-west Spain, growing over sediments with between 1 mmol l(-1) and 70 mmol l(-1) zinc. A glasshouse experiment was designed to investigate the synergic effect of zinc from 0 mmol l(-1) to 60 mmol l(-1) at 0, 1, and 3% NaCl on the growth and the photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and gas exchange, and its recovery after removing zinc. Antioxidant enzyme activities and total zinc, sodium, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen concentrations were also determined. Spartina densiflora showed the highest growth at 1 mmol l(-1) zinc and 1% NaCl after 90 d of treatment; this enhanced growth was supported by the measurements of net photosynthetic rate (A). Furthermore, there was a stimulatory effect of salinity on accumulation of zinc in tillers of this species. Zinc concentrations >1 mmol l(-1) reduced growth of S. densiflora, regardless of salinity treatments. This declining growth may be attributed to a decrease in A caused by diffusional limitation of photosynthesis, owing to the modification of the potassium/calcium ratio. Also, zinc and salinity had a marked overall effect on the photochemical (photosystem II) apparatus, partially mediated by the accumulation of H2O2 and subsequent oxidative damage. However, salinity favoured the recovery of the photosynthetic apparatus to the toxic action of zinc, and enhanced the nutrient uptake.

TI  - Pattern of mercury distribution in sediments from an irregular hydrological regime estuary
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Patos Estuary, in southern Brazil, is subject to an irregular hydrological regime and receives mercury (Hg)-contaminated effluents from the city of Rio Grande since the colonial period of southern Brazil. Aiming to investigate sulfate reduction effects over Hg geochemistry in a shallow area (SA) and a salt marsh (SM) from the Patos Estuary, four sediment cores were collected during two distinct hydrological regimes (i.e., freshwater dominated and brackish water dominated). An assessment of free dissolved sulfide (Sigma S-II) concentration and pH in pore water and metals (Fe and Hg), fine grained (<63 mu m) and organic carbon (OC) contents in sediment allowed us to conclude that mercury distribution in SA is chiefly controlled by <63 mu m sediments and metal sulfide formation. Furthermore, redox conditions were relatively stable during both sampling periods. Nevertheless, bioturbation promotes oxygen penetration and subsequent acidification of pore water associated with upper sediment layers in SM, especially during the brackish water period. Most likely, such oxidizing conditions hamper sulfate reduction and, thereafter, Hg immobilization via the formation of metal sulfides. No evidence of anthropogenic contamination was found in the studied sediments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating Tidal Wetland Restoration Performance Using National Estuarine Research Reserve System Reference Sites and the Restoration Performance Index (RPI)
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluations of tidal wetland restoration efforts suffer from a lack of appropriate reference sites and standardized methods among projects. To help address these issues, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) and the NOAA Restoration Center engaged in a partnership to monitor ecological responses and evaluate 17 tidal wetland restoration projects associated with five reserves. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the level of restoration achieved at each project using the restoration performance index (RPI), which compares change in parameters over time between reference and restoration sites, (2) compare hydrologic and excavation restoration projects using the RPI, (3) identify key indicator parameters for assessing restoration effectiveness, and (4) evaluate the value of the NERRS as reference sites for local restoration projects. We found that the RPI, modified for this study, was an effective tool for evaluating relative differences in restoration performance; most projects achieved an intermediate level of restoration from 2008 to 2010, and two sites became very similar to their paired reference sites, indicating that the restoration efforts were highly effective. There were no differences in RPI scores between hydrologic and excavation restoration project types. Two abiotic parameters (marsh platform elevation and groundwater level) were significantly correlated with vegetation community structure and thus can potentially influence restoration performance. Our results highlight the value of the NERRS as reference sites for assessing tidal wetland restoration projects and provide improved guidance for scientists and restoration practitioners by highlighting the RPI as a trajectory analysis tool and identifying key monitoring parameters.

TI  - Meta-analysis demonstrating that moderate grazing can improve the soil quality across China's grassland ecosystems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although numerous studies have demonstrated that grazing significantly affects soil nutrients, plant biomass and soil microbial activities in grassland ecosystem, the responses of the relationships of soil nutrients with plant biomass and soil microbial activities to grazing intensities at a large scale are still unknown. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis across China's grasslands to address these questions. Our results suggested that different grazing intensities (low grazing (LG), medium grazing (MG) and high grazing (HG)) were closely related to plant biomass, soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial and enzyme activities. Specifically, MG significantly increased below-ground biomass (BGB). HG apparently decreased soil microbial activities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while LG showed the opposite results. The grazing-induced changes in plant biomass, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen might be the main underlying drivers that control the responses of SOC and TN to grazing intensities. The findings highlighted that LG was suitable for the sustainable development of China's grasslands and even worldwide dryland management.

TI  - Short-term variability of intertidal benthic community production during emersion and the implication in annual budget calculation
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term variability in benthic community primary production was studied during the course of emersion on a study site located in the Bay of Somme (eastern English Channel, France). Primary production was estimated at the community level through in situ measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes (infra-red analysis) in benthic chambers. Throughout the emersion period, gross community production (GCP) exhibited strong variations that were strongly correlated with natural variations in light. Light response curves explained the variations in GCP during the greater part of the emersion period, and vertical migrations of the microphytobenthos were suggested to explain the remaining variations (i.e. just before or just after immersion of the study site). A time lag was observed between the start of emersion and the maximum GCP, which was positively correlated with the time lag between emersion and local noon. The introduction of this time lag within the annual budget calculation enhanced production variability at a 2 wk time scale (i.e. tidal cycle), but light variability at the small time scale (i.e. cloudiness) remained the major factor inducing production variability. Results highlighted that omitting the time lag between emersion time and the maximum GCP within annual budget calculations led to large overestimations of annual GCP, since the annual budget for the study site was recalculated as being 67 g C m(-2) yr(-1) compared to 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1) when the short-term variability was not taken into account.

AB  - The coastal zone is treated as an integrated physical system extending from the upper limit of the watershed on the landward side to the identifiable downstream limit of the shelf sea plume on the seaward side. Emergent spatial properties of the system are identified, which define a chain of segments representing a transect through the coastal zone. The integrated chemical and biological properties of individual segments are described by the net system metabolism, the ratio of gross primary production and gross respiration. Changes in net metabolism along the coastal zone transect are driven by physical flushing of the segments and allochthonous carbon and nutrient loadings. Flushing interacts with chemistry and biology by competing with heterotrophic processes for the dissolved and particulate products of autotrophic processes. Thus, the net metabolic response of a segment to allochthonous loading will be governed by the rate of flushing. One outcome of the review is the conclusion that coastal zone managers should be as, or even more concerned about particulate and dissolved organic matter loadings to the environment as they have been in the past about dissolved inorganic nutrient loadings.

TI  - SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA ROOT DYNAMICS IN A VIRGINIA MARSH
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A litter bag technique was used to measure root and rhizome decomposition and production f or 2 years in creekside and interior sediments in a Spartina alterniflora marsh on the seaside of the Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, USA. Decay was equally rapid regardless of incubation in either creekside or interior sediments and did not vary with depth. Weight loss during the first growing season was 39 and 35 % (creekside and interior respectively). By the end of the second growing season between 81 and 88 % (creekside and interior respectively) of the starting root and rhizome material had decayed. In creekside sediments, very little root growth was measured during either year and root production was highly variable between years (1253 and 99 g m-2). In the interior marsh, the patterns of root growth and the amount of root material produced were similar each year (2016 and 2269 g M-2) . Root and rhizome turnover was faster in the creekside sediments (2.63 yr-1) than in the marsh interior (0.54 yr-1). The greater root production and slower root turnover in the interior marsh occurred in sediments with elevated salinities and oxidation-reduction potentials, and lower sediment saturation. These results suggest that differences in organic matter accumulation in high and low marsh areas may be explained by differences in root production and not differences in decay processes.

TI  - Specific bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic communities in tidal-flat sediments along a vertical profile of several meters
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The subsurface of a tidal-flat sediment was analyzed down to 360 cm in depth by molecular and geochemical methods. A community structure analysis of all three domains of life was pet-formed using domain-specific PCR followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and sequencing of characteristic bands. The sediment column comprised horizons easily distinguishable by lithology that were deposited in intertidal and salt marsh environments. The pore water profile was characterized by a subsurface sulfate peak at a depth of about 250 cm. Methane and sulfate profiles were opposed, showing increased methane concentrations in the sulfate-free layers. The availability of organic carbon appeared to have the most pronounced effect on the bacterial community composition in deeper sediment layers. In general, the bacterial community was dominated by fermenters and syntrophic bacteria. The depth distribution of methanogenic archaea correlated with the sulfate profile and could be explained by electron donor competition with sulfate-reducing bacteria. Sequences affiliated with the typically hydrogenotrophic Methanoinicrobiales were present in sulfate-free layers. Archaea belonging to the Methanosarcinales that utilize noncompetitive substrates were found along the entire anoxic-sediment column. Primers targeting the eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene revealed the presence of a subset of archaeal sequences in the deeper part of the sediment cores. The phylogenetic distance to other archaeal sequences indicates that these organisms represent a new phylogenetic group, proposed as "tidal-flat cluster 1." Eukarya were still detectable at 360 cm, even though their diversity decreased with depth. Most of the eukaryotic sequences were distantly related to those of grazers and deposit feeders.

TI  - Photochemical degradation of oil products in seawater monitored by 3D excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy: implications for coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) studies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence 3D excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra of oil products in artificial seawater were monitored as a function of irradiation time in a solar simulator. EEMs were obtained for an excitation range of 240-400nm and an emission range of 248-830nm; this is the wavelength range typically used in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) EEM studies in natural waters. This allows for comparison to prior work on CDOM in an oil-contaminated salt marsh that attributed a fluorescent component in the tryptophan/tyrosine protein-region to oil. For comparison, EEMs were also measured for a broader excitation range of 220-400nm typically used in oil related studies to capture the primary oil peak at lower excitation wavelengths. Fluorescence intensities in both excitation wavelength ranges decayed exponentially with irradiation time consistent with first-order kinetics. There was little change in wavelength for primary oil peaks. However, in the CDOM, wavelength range peaks typically shifted to longer excitation and shorter emission wavelengths, moving into the protein peak region of the CDOM EEM spectrum. This is consistent with a decrease in the complexity of the structure of the organic material. Half-lives for photodegradation ranged from 0.36 to 7.2days for the oil wavelength range and 0.14 to 28days for the CDOM wavelength range. Higher density oils typically had higher degradation rate constants. Peak locations and peak behaviour are consistent with the primary fluorophore in the oil products being PAH-related.

TI  - Selection of plant physiological parameters to detect stress effects in pot experiments using principal component analysis
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate selection and well-timed measurement of plant developmental, morphological and physiological parameters are essential to maximize efficacy and minimize time consumption of experiments. To select for the most sensitive indicators of drought or salt stress, three independent pot experiments with diverse setups were analysed with 20-20 measured parameters. Parameters of plant growth, phenology and symbiotic interactions, visual stress symptoms, photosynthetic activity, nutrient composition and vitality were studied and the result matrices were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA). Stress effects manifested in PC1 of two experiments and in PC2 of the third one. Traits assumed to be adequate for stress indication were characterized by high PC1 or PC2 loading values. Beside parameters of biomass production, growth and visible stress symptoms, less evident traits e.g. root electrical capacitance, membrane stability index in roots and leaves, relative water content of leaves and SPAD units were identified.

T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article

CP  - 10th INTECOL International Wetlands Conference
CL  - Nanjing Univ, Changshu, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The relative importance of environmental variables for Spartina alterniflora distribution was investigated across different spatial scales using maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt), a species distribution modelling technique. The results showed that elevation was the most important predictor for species presence at each scale. Mean diurnal temperature range and isothermality were the second most important predictors at national and regional scales respectively. Soil drainage class, pH and organic carbon were important on the northern Chinese coast. The importance of climatic variable type was highest at global and national scales and declined as the scale decreased. The importance of soil variable type was lower at coarser scales, but varied greatly at finer scales. The relationships between environmental variables and species presence changed as the variables' ranges changed across different scales. Climatic and soil variables were substantially affected by interactions among variables, which changed their relationships with species presence and relative importance. The modelled suitable area on the Chinese coast decreased from 54.16 to 12.64% limited by elevation from the global to national scale, and decreased to 8.04% limited by soil drainage, pH and organic carbon from the national to regional scale. The findings of the present study emphasise the importance of spatial scale for understanding relationships between environmental variables and the presence of S. alterniflora.

M3  - Article
AB  - World is suffering from severe energy crisis and require an efficient renewable energy source. To meet global energy demands, the conservation of renewable energy sources is inevitable. Significant renewable energy can be produced from organic matter that is otherwise considered waste in the form of clean bioelectricity. A less mediator plant microbial fuel cell designed for comparative analysis, power density of two different electrodes; Nickel and Graphite and tested using different local salt marsh grass species Sporobolasarabicus and Cynodondactylon. Both electrodes generated the power density of 23 mW/m(2) and 10.7 mW/m(2) respectively withoutusing feed solution. In other experiments using feed solution, the power output was also recorded during the period of two months. The maximum power density recorded as 120 mW/m(2) and 58mW/m(2) respectively from S. arabicus and C. dactylonspecies. Electrodes coupling with same or different electrode materials checked and current voltage relationship with power recorded before and after the application of plant nutrient solution from 1-8th weeks. Maximum current voltage relationship with power measured around 4-6th week for different electrodes and plant species. Graphite proved best electrode material as compared to Nickel for production of electricity. Two conditions existed in the single chamber configuration, one in which cathode was placed inside the soil near roots to consume oxygen and other was to improve power enhancement using plant nutrient solutions. Ohmic resistance and mass transfer losses could be decreased using membrane-less configuration that in fact makes it cost effective because membrane is the primary cost of plant microbial fuel cell. The main reason for not using membraneis that the concentration of oxygen decreases very much in the depth of water or sediment which reduces the need for a membrane. Moreover, the soil or sediment might filter oxygen, acts as PEM and the redox potential of soil also decreases.

TI  - Mercury Speciation and Distribution in Coastal Wetlands and Tidal Mudflats: Relationships with Sulphur Speciation and Organic Carbon
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment cores were analysed from four coastal wetland sites within the Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy to compare mercury speciation and sediment characteristics. The coastal wetland sediments were low in total mercury (mean = 17.4 +/- 9.9 ng g(-1)); however, MeHg concentration was 92 times higher (mean of 249 pg g(-1)) than intertidal mudflat sediment (mean of 2.7 pg g(-1)). Total mercury concentrations in intertidal mudflat cores were also low (0.5-23.7 ng g(-1)) and correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.98; p < 0.01) with % organic carbon; with low concentrations of MeHg present only below depths of 6 cm (mean = 2.7 +/- 1.0 pg g(-1)). Total mercury concentrations were negatively correlated (correlation = 0.56, p < 0.05) with inorganic sulphur (acid volatile sulphides (AVS) and pyrite) while MeHg concentrations were inversely correlated (Pearson correlation = -0.68; p < 0.05) with the pyrite content but not with AVS. Methyl mercury concentrations were not significantly correlated with organic carbon content in the wetland sediments, and mercury-in-biomass enrichment factors were lower (total mercury mean 1.5 +/- 1.9 and MeHg mean = 3.6 +/- 4.8) than published measurements from mercury polluted sites. Modelling estimates found on average 4.4 times more total mercury mass in the intertidal mudflat sediments relative to vegetated wetlands. A negative relationship was observed between MeHg concentrations (below 20 cm depth) and modelled tidal inundation. The mineral fraction within wetland sediments contained 96.2% of the total mercury mass; however, the highest concentrations of mercury species were in root biomass. This research confirms that vegetated coastal wetlands are key areas for formation of bioavailable methyl mercury, and mercury distribution is tied to organic carbon and sulphur speciation.

TI  - Sediment starvation destroys New York City marshes' resistance to sea level rise
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - New York City (NYC) is representative of many vulnerable coastal urban populations, infrastructures, and economies threatened by global sea level rise. The steady loss of marshes in NYC's Jamaica Bay is typical of many urban estuaries worldwide. Essential to the restoration and preservation of these key wetlands is an understanding of their sedimentation. Here we present a reconstruction of the history of mineral and organic sediment fluxes in Jamaica Bay marshes over three centuries, using a combination of density measurements and a detailed accretion model. Accretion rate is calculated using historical land use and pollution markers, through a wide variety of sediment core analyses including geochemical, isotopic, and paleobotanical analyses. We find that, since 1800 CE, urban development dramatically reduced the input of marsh-stabilizing mineral sediment. However, as mineral flux decreased, organic matter flux increased. While this organic accumulation increase allowed vertical accumulation to outpace sea level, reduced mineral content causes structural weakness and edge failure. Marsh integrity now requires mineral sediment addition to both marshes and subsurface channels and borrow pits, a solution applicable to drowning estuaries worldwide. Integration of marsh mineral/organic accretion history with modeling provides parameters for marsh preservation at specific locales with sea level rise.

T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove sediments are anaerobic ecosystems rich in organic matter. This environment is optimal for anaerobic microorganisms, such as sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which are responsible for nutrient cycling. In this study, the diversity of these two functional guilds was evaluated in a pristine mangrove forest using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library sequencing in a 50 cm vertical profile sampled every 5.0 cm. DGGE profiles indicated that both groups presented higher richness in shallow samples (0-30 cm) with a steep decrease in richness beyond that depth. According to redundancy analysis, this alteration significantly correlated with a decrease in the amount of organic matter. Clone library sequencing indicated that depth had a strong effect on the selection of dissimilatory sulphate reductase (dsrB) operational taxonomic units (OTUs), as indicated by the small number of shared OTUs found in shallow (0.0 cm) and deep (40.0 cm) libraries. On the other hand, methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) libraries indicated that most of the OTUs found in the shallow library were present in the deep library. These results show that these two guilds co-exist in these mangrove sediments and indicate important roles for these organisms in nutrient cycling within this ecosystem.

TI  - Increased fluctuation of sulfur alleviates cadmium toxicity and exacerbates the expansion of Spartina alterniflora in coastal wetlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence suggests that the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) poses potentially serious risks to the stability of coastal wetlands, an ecosystem that is extremely vulnerable to both biological and non-biological threats. However, the effects and mechanisms of sulfur (S) in mediating the growth and expansion of S. alterniflora are poorly understood, particularly when sediments are contaminated with cadmium (Cd). A 6-month greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the mediating effect of S on Cd tolerance and growth of S. alterniflora. Treatments consisted of a factorial combination of three S rates (applied as Na2SO4; 0, 500, 1000 mg kg(-1) dry weight (DW), as S-0, S-500, and S-1000) and four Cd rates (applied as CdCl2; 0, 1, 2, 4 mg kg(-1) DW, as Cd-0, Cd-1, Cd-2, and Cd-4). Results showed that although the exogenous S supply obviously increased Cd accu-mulation in roots (up to 71.22 +/- 6.43 mg kg(-1) DW) due to the decrease of Fe concentration in iron plaque (down to 4.02 +/- 1.18 mg g(-1) DW), biomass reduction and oxidative stress in plant tissues were significantly alleviated. The addition of S significantly up-regulated the concentration of compounds related to Cd tolerance, including proline and glutathione. Therefore, the translocation of Cd was restricted, and plant growth was not impacted. The present study demonstrated that the exogenous sulfur supply could promote the growth of S. alterniflora and enhance its tolerance to Cd. Therefore, under the effects of S. alterniflora, the increased fluctuations of S pool caused by the release and deposition of S might further exacerbate S. alterniflora expansion in Cd contaminated coastal wetlands.

TI  - Climate change and loss of saltmarshes: consequences for birds
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are areas of vegetation subject to tidal inundation and are important to birds for several reasons. Saltmarshes are areas of high primary productivity and their greatest significance for coastal birds is probably as the base of estuarine food webs, because saltmarshes export considerable amounts of organic carbon to adjacent habitats, particularly to the invertebrates of mudflats. In addition, saltmarshes are of direct importance to birds by providing sites for feeding, nesting and roosting. Climate change can affect saltmarshes in a number of ways, including through sea-level rise. When sea-level rises the marsh vegetation moves upward and inland but sea walls that prevent this are said to lead to coastal squeeze and loss of marsh area. However, evidence from southeast England, and elsewhere, indicates that sea-level rise does not necessarily lead to loss of marsh area because marshes accrete vertically and maintain their elevation with respect to sea-level where the supply of sediment is sufficient. Organogenic marshes and those in areas where sediment may be more limiting (e.g. some west coast areas) may be more susceptible to coastal squeeze, as may other marshes, if some extreme predictions of accelerated rates of sea-level rise are realized.

TI  - Metal speciation in surface sediments of the Vigo Ria (NW Iberian Peninsula)
T2  - SCIENTIA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Total concentrations and chemical forms of metals in surface sediments of the Vigo Ria (NW Iberian Peninsula) were determined following the sequential extraction method proposed by Tessier et at. (1979). Total values ranged from 7 to 14 mu gCo g(-1), 52 to 76 mu gCr g(-1), 18 to 82 mu gCu g(-1), 136 to 209 mu gMn g(-1), 18 to 30 mu gNi g(-1), 24 to 112 mu gPb g(-1), 62 to 185 mu gZn g(-1) and 18 to 34 mg g(-1) for Fe. The distribution of metals is strongly influenced by the presence of urban and industrial centres. A decreasing concentration trend was observed towards (i) the outer-oceanic part of the ria and (ii) the northern shore in the middle part. Cobalt, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni were found to be strongly associated with the residual fraction of the sediment (65-78%), whereas Cu is significantly present in the oxidisable phase (34-72%) and Pb and Zn are found in both the reducible (14-49%) and the oxidisable (14-39%) phases. The speciation patterns reflect natural uncontaminated conditions in the outer part of the ria. However, a significant fraction of the Cu, Ph, and Zn in the sediments of the southern margin of the middle part of the ria, which supports most of the population and industrial activities, is present in labile forms, so a potential pollution risk may exist.

TI  - The effect of reciprocal treatments with ozone and ultraviolet-B radiation on photosynthesis and growth of perennial grass Elymus athericus
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact on plant growth of the simultaneously changing factors of the global climate, rising tropospheric O-3 concentrations and increasing UV-B radiation fluxes, has been tested in a combined glasshouse and growth chamber experiment. The saltmarsh grass species Elymus athericus was sequentially fumigated for two weeks with O-3 and for another two weeks irradiated with UV-B (vv). Exposure to elevated UV-B did not negatively affect photosynthesis or plant growth. Fumigation with O-3 had a depressing effect on net photosynthesis, the number and biomass of flowers, the number of leaves and the number of shoots. O-3-induced damage only was observed in plants which had been fumigated during the last two weeks of the experiment. Since interactive responses were not observed, results suggest different primary target sites for O-3 and UV-B within the plant. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - An understanding of trace metal pollution due to reclamation activities around Yancheng National Nature Reserve is important for the utilisation and management of the reserve and surrounding coastal and marine areas. In the present study, we evaluated the current state of Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn pollution (total concentrations and ecological risk), their potential hazard (availability index and desorption rate) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, iron and manganese oxide content, soil organic matter, salinity and pH) in different land use types around this nature reserve. Although the current state of trace metal pollution was not severe, the potential hazards of these trace metals should not be ignored, especially for Cd because of its significantly higher availability index values in farmlands and aquaculture ponds than in natural habitats (by 33 and 32% of the total amount of Cd respectively). Thus, strict monitoring and environmentally responsible land reclamation management practices should be considered for these coastal areas.

TI  - Tracing the flow of organic matter from primary producers to filter feeders in Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal
T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The flow of organic matter along the main navigation channel of Ria Formosa, Portugal, was assessed using determinations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM), and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in conjunction with stable isotope values of primary producers, particulate matter, and two filter feeders. SPM in the lagoon is dominated by inorganic particles comprising 80% of total weight with organic matter averaging about 20%. The algal component of the POM averaged about 5% with the remainder comprised of detritus. The delta(13)C values of primary producers ranged from -9.1parts per thousand in the intertidal seagrass; Zostera noltii to -30.7parts per thousand in the red seaweed Bostrychia scorpioides revealing underlying differences in the mechanisms of carbon uptake. The delta(13)C value of B. scorpioides, which develops entangled on the salt marsh species Spartina maritima, suggests that its main source of inorganic carbon is atmospheric CO2. The delta(13)C Values of the high marsh macrophyte Sarcocornia perennis significantly increased with distance from the ocean while delta(13)C values of Z. noltii decreased, probably because higher decomposition of organic matter at inner stations lowers the delta(13)CO(2) value in the water. The delta(15)N values of Ulvales, seagrasses, and marsh plants significantly increased from outer stations to inner stations. This increase may be due either to recycling of nitrogen (N) within the marsh (with loss of light N-2 or NH4) or to inputs of isotopically heavy N from sewage. The delta(15)N values of particulate matter showed an opposite trend, which indicates higher microbial degradation of organic matter at the inner lagoon. The data demonstrate that the seston in the lagoon is a mixture of detritus from lagoon primary producers with a minor contribution of microalgae. The filter feeders are most likely assimilating a mixture of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. Digestion of lagoon seston is selective. The delta(15)N values of both muscle and digestive gland of filter feeders showed the opposite gradient of particulate matter indicating that the depleted delta(15)N of SPM at inner stations was not assimilated or even ingested. Stable isotopes values did not differ between the filter-feeders-the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis collected on buoys and the clam Tapes decussatus collected in the sediment-suggesting a considerable mixture of benthic-pelagic organic matter throughout the water column. Assessment of the changes in isotopic decomposition of detritus as it decays is required to refine our understanding of organic matter transfers in detrital food webs.

TI  - Carbon transfer from detrital leaves of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to bacteria
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decomposition and leaching of brown leaves of eelgrass (Zostera marina) was followed with or without a community of indigenous bacteria. The leaves lost 9% of their ash free dry mass (AFDM) via leaching during 30 days. At this time bacterial production supported by the leaves was distributed with 61% in the water and 39% on the leaves. A carbon budget indicated that bacteria consumed 28% of the leached dissolved organic carbon. This consumed carbon was mostly (71%) respired and 29% of it was allocated into the bacterial biomass. Eight percent of the leached organic carbon and 0.8% of the initial carbon content of the leaves entered into the bacterial biomass. The results can be used to estimate transfer of carbon from detrital eelgrass leaves to bacteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tipping Points in the Mangrove March: Characterization of Biogeochemical Cycling Along the Mangrove-Salt Marsh Ecotone
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation communities can respond to sea level rise via the encroachment of more salt- and inundation-tolerant species into existing vegetation communities. Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts. Increases in salinity and inundation were linked to mangrove encroachment.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of methane (CH4) concentrations and diffusive fluxes from a tropical coastal embayment surrounded by a large urban area (Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing concentrations of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere stress the importance of monitoring and quantifying the fluxes from coastal environments. In nine sampling campaigns between 2013 and 2014, we measured the spatial CH4 concentrations, identified major sources and calculated the fluxes at the air-water interface in an eutrophic tropical embayment, Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The bay presented high spatial variability of CH4 concentrations, without a significant trend with salinity, but observed the influence of the urban areas at its watershed. Although the more polluted sector of the bay accounts for about 10% of the sampled surface area, it contributed to one half of the bay's total CH4 emissions. In most cases, high CH4 concentrations seemed be sustained by allochtonous sources such as the sewage network and polluted rivers, especially under high accumulated precipitation conditions. In the most stratified area, at the inner and centre of the Bay, CH4 concentrations were not significantly higher in bottom hypoxic waters than in surface waters, suggesting that CH4 diffusion from these sediments was modest, due to the prevalence of sulphate reduction over methanogenesis. Our calculated annual air-sea fluxes (565-980 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) are well above those of most estuaries worldwide, showing that urban pollution can be an important source of CH4 to the coastal waters and even more significant than the presence of organic-rich environments, like salt marshes and mangroves. Comparing the greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO2-equivalent, CH4 emissions reduced the net CO2 sink in Guanabara Bay by 16%.

TI  - Can denitrification explain coastal wetland loss: A review of case studies in the Mississippi Delta and New England
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - There has been considerable discussion over the past several years about the potential negative effects of nutrient loading on coastal wetland stability. In particular, there have been concerns that high nitrate concentrations can fuel denitrification that can lead to soil organic matter loss and wetland deterioration. Here we review these issues for three case studies where there have been elevated levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, especially nitrate, coincident with wetland deterioration. These case studies include the Breton Sound estuary that receives diverted Mississippi River water at Caernarvon LA, a freshwater assimilation wetland that receives treated municipal effluent from a wastewater treatment plant at Hammond, LA, and a tidal creek in the Plum Island Sound estuary of northeastern Massachusetts where nitrate was introduced on each flood tide during the growing season for nearly ten years. We review the physical setting, ecology and biogeochemistry of these sites and use stoichiometric calculations to estimate how much soil organic matter decomposition could be accounted for by denitrification. Results of these calculations show that denitrification rates could not have caused the observed marsh deterioration at the two LA marshes. Denitrification may play a significant role in marsh loss at the MA site, however due to the unique hydrology of this site, denitrification rates induced by very high nitrogen loading rates in concert with the hydrology of the site may play a more significant role in marsh deterioration.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment collections on a mainland hinging marsh, a lagoon marsh and a barrier island hinging marsh were conducted in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of aerial photographs to relate changes in marsh area to sedimentary processes. The island marsh lost 7.2% of its area in 8 years by overwash. The lagoon marsh lost 10.6% of its area over 41 years by recession of marsh edges. The mainland marsh area increased by 8.2% over 50 years, primarily by upland encroachment. Surface sediment was collected monthly at the mainland and lagoon marshes for 1 year to identify changes in the mean grain size, organic content and mass of sediment deposited on sampling plates. Short-term variability in these characteristics obscured seasonal differences. Grain size and monthly sediment accumulation decreased towards the interior of both marshes, while the organic matter content increased. On the lagoon marsh, coarse sediment at creekside stations, as well as grain size contrasts between surface and subsurface sediment, are consistent with erosion evident in GIS analysis. On the mainland marsh, sediment does not vary as much with location or depth, and topography appears stable. Tidal currents appear to be competent to resuspend most particle sizes represented in surface sediment samples, including aggregates, except at the edge of the lagoon site. Decreasing rates of marsh edge change reflect moderation of oceanic processes, while the interior of both lagoon and mainland marshes remained stable throughout the study. Both lagoon marsh losses to recession and mainland marsh gains from upland reflect the submergence which this shoreline experiences. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Methane is a greenhouse gas of largely biological origin. Micro-organisms responsible for production of much of the atmospheric methane are directly affected by climate resulting in potential feedbacks between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Our current understanding of the role of methane in the climate system is reviewed in this article, with a brief discussion of biological, chemical, and physical processes responsible for the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric methane. The magnitude of most methane sources is highly speculative, and their distributions are qualitatively understood. Most terrestrial source regions have been surveyed, but few have been studied in much derail. The strength of enteric sources is based on laboratory measurements of emissions from a few animals and estimates of global populations. Accuracy of the resulting flux size and distribution is highly suspect. Data available on either magnitude or distribution of non-biogenic methane sources are scarce. Models of the influence of climate on biological methane sources are primarily regressions dependent on measures of heat and water in the environment. Process-based models derived from biological and physical principles are called for in order to address environmental conditions unlike the present.

TI  - Seawater intrusion mediates species transition in low salinity, tidal marsh vegetation
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a transitioning tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) experiencing relative sea-level rise, the native vegetation community has been introduced to both an abiotic stressor (salt) and a new plant competitor (Spartina alterniflora). Within a narrow salinity range (0-3), we examined the interplay between salt stress and plant interactions by comparing growth and nutrient status of Spartina alterniflora grown alone and in the presence of one of three TFM species (Leersia oryzoides, Peltandra virginica, and Phragmites australis). We conducted a mesocosm study pairing Spartina alterniflora with a TFM plant or a conspecific and subjecting the pairs to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 1.5, and 3). Measured plant traits included net photosynthesis (A(net)), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and their corresponding ratios. Relative to Spartina alterniflora grown alone, the presence of either TFM grass (Leersia oryzoides and Phragmites australis): (1) altered Spartina alterniflora A(net), (2) suppressed Spartina alterniflora biomass accumulation aboveground and belowground in all salinity treatment levels, and (3) altered aboveground and belowground tissue nutrient content. Regardless of neighbor, Spartina alterniflora's growth and nutrient status was greatest at the lowest salinity and remained largely unchanged in the presence of Peltandra virginica. These results suggest that Spartina alterniflora can successfully expand into TFM communities. Once established, salt stress eventually may hasten the transition to a Spartina alterniflora-dominated marsh community. The success of Spartina alterniflora may allow these marshes to maintain vegetation and increase their likelihood of maintaining elevation with rising sea level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Data from: Trophic dynamics of filter feeding bivalves in the Yangtze Estuarine Intertidal Marsh: stable isotope and fatty acid analyses
T2  - Dryad
M3  - Data set
AB  - Benthic bivalves are important links between primary production and      consumers, and are essential intermediates in the flow of energy through      estuarine systems. However, information on the diet of filter feeding      bivalves in estuarine ecosystems is uncertain, as estuarine waters contain      particulate matter from a range of sources and as bivalves are      opportunistic feeders. We surveyed bivalves at different distances from      the creek mouth at the Yangtze estuarine marsh in winter and summer, and      analyzed trophic dynamics using stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA)      techniques. Different bivalve species had different spatial distributions      in the estuary. Glauconome chinensis mainly occurred in marshes near the      creek mouth, while Sinonovacula constricta preferred the creek.      Differences were found in the diets of different species. S. constricta      consumed more diatoms and bacteria than G. chinensis, while G. chinensis      assimilated more macrophyte material. FA markers showed that plants      contributed the most (38.86  4.25%) to particular organic matter (POM) in      summer, while diatoms contributed the most (12.68  1.17%) during winter.      Diatoms made the largest contribution to the diet of S. constricta in both      summer (24.73  0.44%) and winter (25.51  0.59%), and plants contributed      no more than 4%. This inconsistency indicates seasonal changes in food      availability and the active feeding habits of the bivalve. Similar FA      profiles for S. constricta indicated that the bivalve had a similar diet      composition at different sites, while different delta13C results suggested the      diet was derived from different carbon sources (C4 plant Spartina      alterniflora and C3 plant Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) at      different sites. Species-specific and temporal and/or spatial variability      in bivalve feeding may affect their ecological functions in intertidal      marshes, which should be considered in the study of food webs and material      flows in estuarine ecosystems. Trophic Dynamics of Filter Feeding Bivalves in the Yangtze Estuarine      Intertidal Marsh: Stable Isotope and Fatty Acid Analysesthe data include      the bivalve distribution in different habitats of estuarial salt marsh.

TI  - Signatures of tetraether lipids reveal anthropogenic overprinting of natural organic matter in sediments of the Thames Estuary, UK
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal foreshore sediments from a 110 km stretch of the Thames Estuary were analysed for glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to track soil organic matter (OM) input and evaluate the impact of coastal urbanisation on their distribution. Concentration of branched (br) GDGTs ranged from < 1 to 15 mu g/g organic carbon (OC) and crenarchaeol ranged from 0.6 to 19 mu g/g OC. An overall decrease in brGDGTs was observed from the inner Thames (Brentford) to the outer Thames (Isle of Grain), suggesting a drop in soil OM input towards the sea. In contrast, crenarchaeol concentration was highest around east London rather than towards the open sea. Such elevated crenarchaeol concentration occurred in the section of the river most influenced by anthropogenic pollution, such as discharge points for London's major sewage treatment plants, docks and power plants. The non-systematic spatial distribution of crenarchaeol was also reflected in the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The highest BIT values occurred upstream and in close proximity to salt marshes (0.8-1), whereas the lowest values (0.3-0.5) were towards the sea. However, unusually low values (0.4) were observed in the river section that had high crenarchaeol concentration. In contrast, bulk delta C-13 values were insensitive to London's anthropogenic influence. This suggests that the natural systematic decrease in BIT index in the estuary is overprinted by London's anthropogenic activity between Deptford Creek and Tilbury. We therefore advise caution when interpreting the BIT index for sediments in close proximity to megacities discharging industrial and municipal waste that can become incorporated into the near surface sedimentary record.

TI  - Capturing dissolved organic carbon dynamics with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in tidally influenced wetland-estuarine systems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands are among the most productive, ecologically valuable, and economically important ecosystems on Earth. Through tidal inundation and lateral export, estuarine marshes exert a strong influence on the amount and quality of carbon and nutrients exchanged between the land and the ocean. Yet, current understanding of the role of these "blue carbon" ecosystems on estuarine optics, biogeochemistry, and ecology is largely based on limited field observations at point locations, due to the coarse resolution of existing and heritage satellite ocean color sensors. Here, for the first time, we merged high resolution data from the constellation of Landsat-8/ Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) to examine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in a tidally influenced marsh-estuarine system. Often referred to as the "Everglades of the North", the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is the largest marsh system in the Chesapeake Bay and one of the most ecologically important areas in the United States. A multiple linear regression approach linking DOC to the spectral shape of water remote sensing reflectance was used to capture marsh DOC export and examine spatial features and temporal changes in DOC over a broad range of conditions (DOC in the range of 2.32-19.9 mg/L), across multiple years, different seasons, and tidal regimes, with a relative error (mean average percent difference) of 23%. Data consistency between satellite sensors was evaluated, followed by the generation of a long term, multi-sensor DOC data record that provided more frequent observations. Combining data from the three satellites revealed the strong impact of marsh outwelling at the larger ecosystem scale, its seasonal variability, and the importance of other environmental factors, including wind conditions, river discharge, and extreme weather events, in shaping DOC dynamics along complex, tidally influenced terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of non-indigenous plants on food sources of intertidal macrobenthos in Yueqing Bay, China: Combining stable isotope and fatty acid analyses
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasions in coastal ecosystems may substantially alter benthic community composition and food web structure. We combined analyses of stable isotopes and fatty acids (FA) to examine the effects of two non-indigenous plants (Spartina alterniflora and Kandelia candel) on the food sources of three deposit feeders (Assiminea brevicula, Cerithidea cingulata and Uca arcuata) and a carnivorous opportunistic predator (Periophthalmus modestus) in Yueqing Bay, China. A wide range of differences was found in delta C-13 and delta N-15 among the macrobenthos. The deposit feeders in K. candel mangrove forest (KC) were markedly more C-13-depleted than those in S. alternifiora marsh (SA) and unvegetated tidal flat (TF), unlike the carnivorous feeder. PERMANOVA showed that FA composition significantly differed among the macmbenthos. Diatom FA markers were higher in tissues of the deposit feeders than in the carnivorous feeder, and slightly lower in macrobenthos from the KC and SA habitats as compared with the TF. In contrast, vascular plant FA markers of macrobenthos were higher in the KC and SA than in the TF, indicating the contribution of mangrove and Spartina detritus to the consumers. The findings show that the food sources of macmbenthos were markedly affected by non-indigenous plants, through the addition of organic detritus derived from vascular plants in the diets together with a decreased contribution of diatoms, although the impacts may differ among different functional feeding groups of macmbenthos.

TI  - Temperature influences the reproduction of fiddler crabs at the southern edge of their distribution
T2  - INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of reproductive biology might provide predictions about fitness and population stability in different locations within the geographical range of a particular species. Leptuca uruguayensis is a fiddler crab that breeds year round in tropical estuaries but only in summer months in temperate salt marshes. In this study, we examined several reproductive attributes of the southernmost population of L. uruguayensis, including the proportion of ovigerous females, the proportion of surface-active crabs, the developmental status of the gonads and hepatopancreas, and the fullness of seminal receptacles, and related them to environmental factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and sediment organic matter content. We found that temperature was the environmental factor that was most correlated with the reproductive process of the southernmost fiddler crab, since this environmental factor was related to ovarian development, to the fullness of seminal receptacles, and to the hepatosomatic index. At the southern edge of its distribution, the low temperatures of winter restricted reproduction in L. uruguayensis. These winter temperatures might represent the lower limit of the thermal window of this fiddler crab, limiting its extension toward higher latitudes.

TI  - Phosphorus fertilizer recovery from calcareous soils amended with humic and fulvic acids
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation of Ca phosphates negatively affects recovery by plants of P fertilizer applied to calcareous soils, but organic matter slows the precipitation of poorly soluble Ca phosphates. To study the effect of high molecular weight organic compounds on the recovery of applied P, a mixture of humic and fulvic acids was applied to calcareous soils with different levels of salinity and Na saturation which were fertilized with 200 and 2000 mg P kg(-1) as NH4H2PO4. Recovery was measured as the ratio of increment in Olsen P-to-applied P after 30, 60 and 150 days, and associated P forms were studied using sequential chemical fractionation and P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Application of the humic-fulvic acid mixture (HFA) increased the amount of applied P recovered as Olsen P in all the soils except in one soil with the highest Na saturation. In soils with high Ca saturation and high Olsen P, recovery increased from < 15% in the absence of amendment to > 40% at a 5 g HFA kg(-1) amendment rate (30 days incubation and 200 mg P kg 1 fertilizer rate). This is ascribed to inhibition of the precipitation of poorly soluble Ca phosphates, consistent with the sequential chemical extraction (reduction of the HCl extractable P) and P concentration in 0.01 M CaCl2 (1: 10 soil: solution ratio) extracts. P-31 NMR spectra revealed that in non-amended samples, most spectral shifts were due to poorly soluble P compounds (carbonate apatite); on the other hand, at the 5 gHFA kg(-1) rate, significant amounts of amorphous Ca phosphate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCDP) were identified. The increase in the recovery of applied P due to HFA reveals a positive effect of the application of organic matter as soil amendments on the efficiency of P fertilizers and also explains that manures and other organic sources of P were more efficient increasing available P than inorganic P fertilizers in calcareous soils.

TI  - Carbon isotope fractionation during bacterial methanogenesis by CO2 reduction
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon isotope fractionation between CO2 and CH4 was studied during open system (related to gas flow) culture experiments with CO2-reducing methanogenic Archaea. To study the temperature dependence of isotope fractionation during biological methanogenesis, three representatives of the order Methanococcales were cultivated in the temperature range 35-85 degrees C. In the stationary growth phase, the carbon isotope fractionation factor between CO2 and CH4 was found to range between 1.048 and 1.079, depending on the growth temperature and on the type of fermenter. In contrast to published data derived from culture experiments, our results fall in the range of naturally occurring carbon isotope fractionations of coexisting CO2-CH4 pairs in marine sediments. Moreover, the fractionation closely approached the thermodynamic equilibrium between both gases, although thermal isotope exchange processes are unlikely to occur below 200 degrees C. Our findings suggest that flow-through culture experiments are useful when studying biological methanogenesis and associated (carbon-) isotope fractionation as a means of deciphering complex methanogenic processes in sediments.

TI  - A field experiment on the influence of the postulated global climatic change on coastal marshland soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A climatic scenario postulates an increase of atmospheric CO2, 55cm water-level rise combined with a 30cm higher tidal amplitude for the North Sea. Further, more frequent and stronger west storms, a 2.5 degrees C mean-annual-temperature increase together with 15% more rainfall during winter time are to be expected until 2050 due to recent human impact. The possible consequences of the postulated changes in temperature and flooding dynamics were studied for soil formation as well as for soil-ecological attributes and processes of two sites at Hedwigenkoog foreshore in N Germany: a Hypersali-tidalic Fluvisol (protothionic, calcaric) (1.5 m asl with > 500 annual floods) and a Gleyi-sali-fidalic Fluvisol (calcaric) under a salt meadow (2.2 m asl with 70 annual floods). Temperature, water, redox, nutrient and gas dynamics were measured at different soil depths for a period of 2 y. The topsoil of the Gleyi-sali-fidalic Fluvisol was permanently heated over an area of 14 m(2) to simulate a temperature rise of 1.5-2.5 degrees C. The results are discussed in relation to two realistic scenarios. If the ground level of the Gleyi-sali-tidalic Fluvisol is heaved up (due to sedimentation) as intensively as the sea level rises, it may be assumed that the soil unit including vegetation cover in principle will not noticeably change. Then, the temperature increase will intensify the activity of soil organisms, bioturbation, and formation of a crumb structure, however, there will be no further accumulation of soil humus. If there was no sedimentation during the next 50 y, the salt meadow itself together with the upper part of the Gleyi-sali-tidalic Fluvisol would be destroyed by erosion, and a Hypersali-tidalic Fluvisol would be formed similar to the studied one.

TI  - Salinity effect on germination, seedling growth and cotyledon membrane complexes of a Portuguese salt marsh wild beet ecotype
T2  - THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) high yields have been achieved through irrigation and this crop is described as coping with mild salinity (40-120 mM NaCl). However, during seed germination, sugar beet is salinity sensitive and soil salinity should not exceed 3 dS/m. Wild beets, ancestors of sugar beet, are naturally able to germinate and grow in saline environments. Salinity tolerance during germination and early seedling development of three Portuguese wild beet ecotypes [Comporta (CMP), Oeiras (OEI), Vaiamonte (VMT)] and one sugar beet cultivar (Isella) was evaluated. Concerning germination, VMT outperformed all the other beets, with 98% (+/- 2%) of glomerules germinating in 200 mM NaCl after 14 days of scarification. However, in 500 mM NaCl, only CMP was able to initiate and maintain radicle emergence, though in a very small extension (< 3%). On the basis of the relative salinity tolerance index, CMP is the less affected by salinity, despite reduced seedling growth and biomass. Since cotyledons length and membrane proteins abundance were negatively affected by salinity, the hypothesis was raised that membranes functionality, including the photochemical multiprotein complexes, was compromised. To test this hypothesis, a blue-native two-dimensional electrophoresis was applied to CMP seedlings. In the cotyledonary leaves, complexes LCI and LC4 and several components of LC2, LC5, LC6 complexes were negatively affected by salinity. The components of the complexes of photosystem I and ATP synthase were less abundant what points out to a lower cotyledon capacity for ATP synthesis and ferredoxin reduction. Lower availability of ATP and reduced ferredoxin imply reduced photosynthetic assimilation and, therefore, lower carbon availability for growth.

TI  - Benthic macrofaunal communities of three sites in San Francisco Bay invaded by hybrid Spartina, with comparison to uninvaded habitats
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A hybrid cordgrass, formed from a cross between Spartina alterniflora (Atlantic cordgrass) and S. foliosa (Pacific cordgrass), has recently spread within the intertidal zone of south San Francisco Bay. Sediment properties and macroinfaunal community structure were compared in patches invaded by Spartina hybrid and adjacent uninvaded patches at 3 sites in San Francisco Bay (2 tidal flats and 1 Salicornia marsh). We hypothesized that (1) sediments vegetated by Spartina hybrid would have reduced sediment grain size, higher organic matter content, lower redox potential, lower salinity and reduced microalgal biomass relative to adjacent unvegetated tidal flat sediments, and (2) that differences in the sediment environment would correspond to changes in the infaunal invertebrate community structure and feeding modes. We observed 75 % lower total macro-faunal density and lower species richness in Spartina-vegetated sediments at Elsie Roemer (30 yr old invasion) than in an adjacent unvegetated tidal flat. This was due to lower densities of surface-feeding amphipods, bivalves, cirratulid and spionid polychaetes. The proportional representation of subsurface-deposit feeders was greater in Spartina patches than in unvegetated sediments. At a more recently invaded site (Roberts Landing; 15 yr invasion), Spartina patches differed from tidal flat sediments in composition, but not in abundance. Native (Salicornia) and Spartina patches exhibited similar sediment properties at San Mateo, where the Spartina hybrid invaded 8 to 10 yr earlier. No differences were detected in densities or proportions of surface- or subsurface-deposit feeders, but the proportion of carnivores/omnivores and grazers increased in the hybrid-invaded patches. These studies suggest that the invasive Spartina hybrid in south San Francisco Bay can have differing effects on sediment ecosystems, possibly depending on the location, age, or type of habitats involved.

TI  - Secretion of total organic carbon and inorganic carbon from roots of seepweed Suaeda heteroptera in response to Zn(II) stress
T2  - Chinese Journal of Applied and Environmental Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - The littoral halophytes are pioneer species that grow in the coastal marshes. They are important plant species for phytoremediation and forming wetland landscape in the coastal zone. To ascertain the secretion of root exudates from littoral halophyte seepweed (Suaeda heteroptera) in response to zinc ion stress, we conducted a pot sandponic test, measured the concentrations of the inorganic carbon (IC) and the total organic carbon (TOC) in the root exudates secreted from seepweed under Zn(II) stress treatment for 32 days. The IC concentrations in the root exudates decreased with the increasing of Zn(II) concentration during a 24-day period under Zn(II) stress treatments. The relationship could be described by an exponential equation. The IC concentrations increased with exposure time except under highest concentration of 200 mg L-1. The relationship could be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation and the linear equation for lower Zn(II) stress treatments (rho(Zn) <= 20 mg L-1) and higher Zn(II) stress treatments (rho(Zn(II)) = 40-100 mg L-1), respectively. The TOC concentration increased with the increasing of Zn(II) concentration during shorter exposure period (< 16 days), but decreased after exposure time of 16 days. The TOC concentration declined with Zn(II)-exposed concentrations higher than 10 mg L-1 of Zn(II). The secretion of inorganic carbon in the roots of seepweed induced by Zn(II) stress increased with increasing exposure time and decreased with exposure concentration. As a conclusion, we think that the changes of respiration and secretion of organic carbon in the roots of seepweed are induced by Zn(II) stress.

TI  - Microbial communities within saltmarsh sediments: Composition, abundance and pollution constraints
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the saltmarsh plant Halimione portucaloides and the level of sediment metal contamination on the distribution of microbial communities were investigated in two Portuguese estuarine systems with different degrees of metal contamination: the Cavado (41.5 N; 8.7 W) and Sado estuaries. In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland plant communities in coastal Louisiana are degrading, resulting in the loss of live emergent vegetation and subsequent succession to open water. Saltwater intrusion has resulted from the construction of navigation canals through the marshes; the subsequent salinity increase is one of the potential sources of sublethal stress on plants. Greenhouse experiments were conducted on Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. to compare the usefulness of several indicators for the detection of salinity stress. CO2 uptake, leaf expansion, proline concentration and live aboveground biomass displayed significant responses to the salinity levels employed as treatments (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 ppt.). CO2 exchange was the only indicator showing a significant response within 7 days of the initiation of treatments (measurements were made at 7, 14 and 42 days).

CP  - 1st International Symposium on Mangroves as Fish Habitat
CL  - Univ Miami, Miami, FL
AB  - Stable isotope ratios are applied in many ways to explore the relationship between mangroves and fishes. Here I summarize information pertinent to three central questions regarding the mangrove-fishes link: Can stable isotope ratios be used to (1) identify basal resource pools that support fishes associated with mangrove habitat?, (2) reveal aspects of consumer trophic structure in mangrove fish communities?, and (3) describe fish movement patterns with respect to mangroves? I review recent research developments that pertain to each question, including a discussion of the limitations of stable isotope ratios in understanding the mangrove-fishes link. I emphasize promising avenues for future research, including labeled isotope tracer experiments, probabilistic and spatial analyses of potential basal resource pools, novel community-wide and intraspecific metrics, and utilization of differential tissue turnover rates within and among organisms. Stable isotope ratios alone provide numerous insights into the role of mangroves as fish habitat, but the most thorough understanding of the mangrove-fisheries link is likely to stem from integrative approaches that combine stable isotope ratio analyses and other methodologies into a broad research framework.

AB  - Organic aggregates were produced in the laboratory by bubbling dissolved organic material derived from five species of coastal macrophytes. The weight of aggregates produced after bubbling was significantly related to the amount of DOC (dissolved organic C) initially present. An average of 19% of the initial DOC was converted to aggregates, 23% remained in solution, and the remaining 58% was mineralized to CO2. The C:N ratios of aggregates did not vary between species or runs and ranged from 4 to 12. Microscopic examination of aggregates showed that they contained large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. The data were interpreted to suggest that aggregates are composed of live and dead bacteria, other microbes, and extracellular material. The ingestion of aggregates of this type by consumers is a potentially important route for the flow of labile organic C in marine systems.

TI  - A conceptual model to improve links between science, policy and practice in coastal management
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The literature has identified significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources due to lack of integration between science, policy and practice. The social and biophysical sciences are an important information source but are often neglected in policy and practice. The literature has identified the science, policy practice gaps as significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources. However, there is lack of research specifically covering the interactions between the three domains. This paper aims to: a) review the literature to identify gaps and related factors or themes contributing to the science-policy-practice disconnect; and b) propose a conceptual integrated model to address those gaps and to increase the uptake of science into policy and practice in coastal systems. The results confirm that there are gaps in the two way-links between science and policy and practice. Most research (64%) is published in the science to policy area, 32% in the policy and practice area, and only four % of the research is published in the science-policy-practice area. Effective integration is inhibited by issues of knowledge, uncertainty, communication, political and cultural issues and institutions or rules and a clear mechanism for linking science, policy and practice is needed. Frameworks may help alleviate the problem but may not be holistic or flexible enough to facilitate interactions across science-policy-practice. There needs to be a clear mechanism for integrating science, policy and practice. To address this a conceptual model of the interactions between science and policy and practice is proposed. The model includes two-way connections between science-policy-practice, mediated by both internal and external factors including key drivers, facilitators, inhibitors and barriers. The model is applied to three case studies, namely: implementing international level blue carbon policy at a local level; an historical perspective on mangrove damage and restoration at an Australian state level; and an Australian example of long-term interactions between science, policy and practice, illustrating how multiple connections and interactions can occur as projects proceed.

It explores the role of global collaboration in science and tropical wetlands and maps out a pathway for enhanced inter-change and exchange of information and practical experience. Whilst scientific initiatives for a range of earth systems have been previously been developed, a systematic and global research initiative for wetlands that crosses cultural, scientific and economic divides is not yet operational. One option when considering such initiatives is to investigate the utility of using the more than 1800 wetlands designated as internationally important under the Ramsar Convention as the basis of an integrated and multi-node field research and global observation program for detecting and even preempting ecological change in wetlands.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland plant communities in coastal Louisiana are degrading, resulting in the loss of live emergent vegetation and subsequent succession to open water. Nutrient deprivation caused by compartmentalization of marsh parcels and impaired water exchange is one of the potential sources of sub-lethal stress on plants. Greenhouse experiments were conducted on Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. to compare the usefulness of several indicators for the detection of nutrient stress. Responses were measured at the end of 7, 14 and 35 days, with experiments timed to end simultaneously. Leaf expansion rate, aboveground biomass, leaf spectral reflectance, adenine nucleotide levels and CO2 exchange rate all detected significant differences among treatments (0, 25, 50 and 100% Hoagland's solution). All but aboveground biomass were able to detect some treatment differences as early as 7 days after initiation of treatments; aboveground biomass detected differences after 14 days. Adenine nucleotide levels showed the best ability to discriminate among the 0, 25, 50 and 100% Hoagland's treatments, while all other indicators were able to detect differences only between the 0% treatment and the higher levels of nutrient application.

TI  - Chemical and biological assessment of an urban, estuarine marsh in northeastern New Jersey, USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Oritani Marsh in the Hackensack Meadowlands of urbanized northeastern New Jersey USA was assessed in 2000 for vegetation, soil/sediment chemistry, abundance/diversity of benthic invertebrates, and bird and mammal usage. Vegetatively, both marsh and uplands are dominated by tall, dense Phragrnites australis. Small patches (less than 2 hectares total) dominated by Spartina spp. were found at the lowest elevations. Soil/sediment cores were sliced into 5 intervals and analyzed for metals, pesticides and volatile/semivolatile organic compounds. Thirteen locations had at least one chemical above Long et al.'s [Environmental Management, 19, 1995, 81-97] "Effects Range-Median" (ERM). Seven metals and nine organics exceeded ERM in at least one sample, with mercury showing the most exceedances. The Surface 15 cm interval was generally more contaminated with metals than the 15 to 30cm interval; the reverse was true for semivolatile organic compounds. Twenty taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates were collected, with each location producing froth 1 to 9 taxa. Abundance ranged froth 11 to 3,889 individuals/m(2). Number of taxa was moderately (r(2) between 0.40 and 0.70) negatively correlated with zinc, beryllium, nickel and arsenic concentrations; no other chemical's r(2) was above 0.25. Diversity was moderately negatively correlated with arsenic and beryllium. These correlations were unexpected: zinc, beryllium, nickel and arsenic were not the chemicals found at the highest concentrations relative to benchmarks. Number of taxi, abundance and diversity were moderately (negatively) correlated with elevation; organic carbon was moderately (positively) correlated with abundance. All other correlations were weak (r(2) < 0.35). Live traps captured only one mammal species, the meadow jumping mouse. Bird observations revealed 39 species, dominated by a few common species.

TI  - Tidal and seasonal variations in the quantity and composition of seston in a North American, mid-Atlantic saltmarsh
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We determined the concentration of seston, particulate organic matter, and biological components (chlorophyll a, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates) for <25 mum size fraction seston over five seasons in Canary Creek saltmarsh, Delaware Bay, USA. This material is the potential food resource for suspension-feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, that inhabit the marsh intertidal zone. For eight tidal cycles each season we collected water six times at hourly intervals from mid-flood tide to mid-ebb tide. Although the concentration of seston did not vary seasonally, there were significant seasonal variations (analysis of variance, P < 0.05) in seston components, with chlorophyll a concentration being highest in May and bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates most abundant in August. Seston composition also varied within each tidal cycle with a magnitude as great as the seasonal variation. We conclude that ribbed mussels are subject to an unpredictable food supply that varies in composition and concentration on the order of hours and days. In contrast to the pronounced temporal changes, seston characteristics did not differ significantly among sampling locations within the marsh, or between samples collected close to the sediment surface and from the upper water column. Resuspension of sediment particles caused by tidal flow was not evident in tidal creeks and there were no dominant patterns in total seston concentration corresponding to tidal stages (flood tide, high slack water, and ebb tide) over the five sampling months. The abundance of biological components in the seston, including chlorophyll a, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, were significantly greater during high flood tide and high slack water than during ebb tide. The decline of biological components, particularly chlorophyll a in the ebb tide, indicates that this temperate saltmarsh imported organic material produced in the Delaware estuary.

TI  - Estimating the Provision of Ecosystem Services by Gulf of Mexico Coastal Wetlands
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Review
AB  - Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coastal wetlands contribute to human well-being by providing many ecosystem services. The GOM region continues to experience substantial losses of coastal wetlands, but the magnitude of reduction in ecosystem services resulting from the loss of GOM coastal wetlands is unknown. To gain an appreciation of the impact of GOM coastal wetland loss on ecosystem services, recent literature was reviewed to derive quantitative estimates of ecosystem services provided by GOM coastal wetlands. GOM coastal wetlands provide essential habitat for the production of juvenile shrimp, which supports the GOM's most valuable commercial fishery; protect coastal communities from storm surge; improve water quality by removing nitrogen from surface waters; and are valuable sinks for greenhouse gases due to high rates of carbon sequestration combined with low rates of methane emission. Using 1998 to 2004 as a baseline, the potential loss of ecosystem services associated with loss of coastal wetlands is presented. Additional research is needed to quantify wetland services at multiple geospatial and socioeconomic scales, to determine the effect of wetland loss on ecosystem services, and to demonstrate the impact of future management decisions on the capacity of GOM coastal wetlands to provide services that affect human well-being.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasion alters soil bulk density in coastal wetlands of China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although empirical studies show that invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) has reduced soil bulk density (BD), the mechanisms that underpin this response are still unclear. To explore this pattern, we used a space-for-time substitution approach and collected soil samples from the eastern coast of China, where S. alterniflora ecosystems were established a short period of time after initial invasion. We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on BD through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes. The model showed that these processes explain 82% of the BD variation in response to S. alterniflora invasion. We observed that SOC had the most direct influence on BD, followed by salinity and soil sand content. We also found that S. alterniflora invasion had an important direct influence on the measured variables. Although plant productivity was not directly related to BD, it was indirectly associated with the impacts of plant productivity on salinity. Our results highlight the occurrence of BD variability within an interacting system of soil and plants wherein S. alterniflora invasion leads to a decrease in BD. This work also highlights that identifying the mechanisms driving BD variability in response to S. alterniflora invasion would help to improve our understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora raised soil sulfide content by regulating sulfur cycle-associated bacteria in the Jiuduansha Wetland of China
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Spartina alterniflora invasion across the southeast coast in China significantly reduced vegetation diversity and generated associated ecological problems. Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora. Conclusion The S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased SOC and TN contents and reduced the abundance of sulfur-oxidizing functional genes, which led to the accumulation of soil sulfide.

TI  - Some soil properties and plant relationships in marshes of the Suwannee River Delta
T2  - Florida Scientist
M3  - Article
AB  - We made this study with the objective of establishing parameters which could be used to determine minimum Suwannee River flows at which significant damage would occur to the environment. Significant damage is defined as that level of degradation of the environment beyond which the system will not be able to return to its former healthy state. We inventoried plant species distribution in the marsh, determined some characteristics of the soils, and measured water salinity. We found many more species of plants in the marshes of the Suwannee delta than is common in tidal marshes distant from fresh water. Some of these plants are highly salt tolerant such as Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene (saltgrass) and Juncus roemerianus Scheele (needlerush). Some have less salt tolerance i.e. Sagittaria lancifolia L. (arrowhead) and Scirpus americanus Pers. (three-square). The soils are high organic mineral soils or organic soils (> 30% organic matter), anoxic, and contain high amounts of sulfur. Soil salinity, measured by electrical conductivity (EC) is higher near the Gulf and decreases as one goes upriver. There is little significant correlation between soil EC and the distribution of most plants. Although saltgrass and needlerush are very common in the areas of highest EC, the generally low salinity levels permit the growth of a variety of plants. Another phenomenon resulting in erratic distribution of plants is wrack, plant debris deposited by storms over existing vegetation, resulting in the death of the original plants and the invasion or expansion by opportunistic species. Low rainfall and low river flow in June, 2000 resulted in an increase in soil water EC of 17% to 142% and damage to several plant species in the Delta.

TI  - Consumption of an exotic plant (Spartina alterniflora) by the macrobenthic fauna in a mangrove wetland at Zhanjiang, China
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic species can affect food webs and cause cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. The exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to mangrove forests in eastern Asia. However, limited knowledge is available about the effects of S. alterniflora on the diet of macrobenthic fauna and food webs in mangrove wetlands. The stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of primary producers and 11 common native macrobenthic fauna were examined to determine whether exotic S. alterniflora has become a food source for macrobenthic fauna in a mangrove wetland in Zhanjiang, China. The MixSIR mixing model revealed that exotic S. alterniflora served as a new food source for native macrobenthic fauna, and even as the main food source for many macrobenthic fauna. These findings suggest that this invasive plant is now part of the local benthic food web, i.e., it serves as a nutrient source for macrobenthic fauna in local mangrove wetlands. This study provides strong evidence that invasive plants can contribute to the diet of native consumers and change their diet patterns, ultimately altering the materials entering local food webs.

TI  - COMPARISON OF THE MANGROVE SOIL WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DISTURBANCE IN TROPICAL AGUA BRAVA LAGOON, MEXICAN PACIFIC
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The texture and geochemical parameters of soil in tropical mangrove ecosystems have been broadly studied, but the effect of environmental stress on mangrove soil with different levels of disturbance has not been established. This study aimed to compare the texture and soil geochemistry of mangrove ecosystems with two levels of disturbance in the tidal basin of Agua Brava Lagoon, National Wetlands Nayarit, Mexico. Forty eight soil samples were collected from two areas of the mangrove ecosystem during an annual cycle; one in high mangrove condition (according to estimated Leaf Area Index) with low disturbance (LD) and the other in poor mangrove condition with high disturbance (HD). Generally, soil texture tends to be softer in LD than HD sites. LD sites had higher concentration of total N and P, organic matter (OM) and organic carbon (OC). HD sites presented an environmental stress with high levels of Ca, Na, salinity and conductivity. We identified four processes that dominate the dynamics of soil in the study area; MO, OC, N relationship and acid-base relationship. In conclusion, the soil conditions of LD and HD sites are dissimilar according to the level of mangrove disturbance, thus demonstrating the importance to maintain healthy mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Nitrogen uptake kinetics and saltmarsh plant responses to global change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important carbon sinks globally, but their ability to store carbon hinges on their nitrogen (N) supply and N uptake dynamics of dominant plant species. In terrestrial ecosystems, uptake of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) through roots can strongly influence N acquisition rates and their responses to environmental factors such as rising atmospheric CO2 and eutrophication. We examined the N-15 uptake kinetics of three dominant plant species in North American coastal wetlands (Spartina patens, C-4 grass; Phragmites australis, C-3 grass; Schoenoplectus americanus, C-3 sedge) under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. We further related our results to the productivity response of these species in two long-term field experiments. S. patens had the greatest uptake rates for NO3- and NH4+ under ambient conditions, suggesting that N uptake kinetics may underlie its strong productivity response to N in the field. Elevated CO2 increased NH4+ and NO3- uptake rates for S. patens, but had negative effects on NO3- uptake rates in P. australis and no effects on S. americanus. We suggest that N uptake kinetics may explain differences in plant community composition in coastal wetlands and that CO2- induced shifts, in combination with N proliferation, could alter ecosystem-scale productivity patterns of saltmarshes globally.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Mangrove soils are complex systems that are strongly influenced by biological activity Bioturbation may be considered as all interactions between animals, plants and soil material that are capable of altering soil structure and processes In mangrove soils, bioturbation by plants and crabs may shift physicochemical conditions thus affecting elements that are sensitive to redox variations, particularly iron and sulfur As a result, the dynamics of these elements may be altered and the concentrations may increase or decrease in both the interstitial water and solid phases This chapter consists of a brief overview of the different ways in which bioturbation (by both crabs and plants) may affect the total concentration and geochemistry of different forms of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in a Brazilian mangrove system To evaluate the effects of bioturbation by plants, iron and sulfur species were compared in unvegetated and vegetated substrates colonized by Spartina and Rhizophora However, to obtain information about how bioturbation caused by crab activity affects Fe and S geochemistry, seasonal sampling was carried out in the unvegetated sediment Total organic carbon (TOC) and total S were analyzed in the solid phase, along with acid volatile sulfide (AVS), iron partitioning, root biomass and percentage of sand The results demonstrate the important role of bioturbation in Fe and S geochemistry The activities of plant roots appear to operate in opposite directions, by promoting both oxidation and synthesis of iron sulfides Oxidation and aeration by root structures generated a more acidic and oxidative environment within superficial layers, where there was a higher density of live roots In contrast, in deeper layers, and underneath zones with a large belowground biomass, root exudates appeared to intensify pyrite synthesis by stimulating the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria Crab burrowing also substantially affected the biogeochemical cycles of S and Fe Crabs affected the redox equilibrium of unvegetated sediments by constructing channels and burrowing, which intensified O-2 diffusion and pyrite oxidation in the summer Bioturbation may therefore be a key factor in the geochemical behavior of Fe and S in mangrove environments, and may affect the partitioning of reduced and oxidized forms of these elements, as well as the processes involved in organic matter decomposition

TI  - Ecological functions of an impounded marsh and three natural estuarine marshes along Woodbridge River, NY/NJ Harbor.
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
M3  - Article
AB  - An impounded estuarine marsh scheduled for restoration in 2003 and three nearby unimpounded marshes (Spartina alterniflora, S. patens/Iva frutescens, and Phragmites australis) in highly urbanized NY/NJ Harbor were studied to assess the impact of impoundment on marsh structure and function and to identify trajectories of ecosystem change following removal of the levee. Aboveground biomass was greater in the Phragmites and S. alterniflora marshes (706-809 g/m2) as compared to the S. patens/I. frutescens and impounded marshes (378-588 g/m2). Macro-organic matter (0-30 cm) was similar across all marshes (7452-9212 g/m2). The S. patens/Iva frutescens marsh had the lowest aboveground biomass, but contained more plant species (2.8 species/0.25 m2) and greater species diversity (H=1.33) than the other marshes (1.3-2.0 species/0.25 m2, H=0.16-0.78). Rates of sediment and nutrient accumulation were lower in the impounded marsh (335 g sediment/m2/yr, 97 g C/m2/yr, 6.5 g N/m2/yr, and 0.9 g P/m2/yr) than in the reference marshes (422-1515 g sediment/m2/yr; 111-160 g C/m2/yr; 7-10 g N/m2/yr; 1.6-2.8 g P/m2/yr). Our results indicate that the impounded marsh does not contain the high species diversity of the high marsh, nor does it provide the same level of functions as naturally inundated marshes. Reintroduction of tidal inundation to the impounded marsh will enhance water quality benefits and favor development of S. alterniflora salt marsh community structure.

AB  - Natural saline soils of Central Argentina have rarely been the focus of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) which are Glomeromycota. We explored the vertical distribution of spores of different AMF species in the rhizosphere of Atriplex lampa in two saline environments (Salinas Grandes and Salinas de Ambargasta) during wet and dry seasons. 18 AMF species were identified. Spore numbers were highest at Salinas Grandes during the wet season. Soil depth showed an influence on spore abundance of some specific species. Our results highlight the effect of soil depth, seasons and soil characteristics on sporulation of AMF species under saline conditions.

TI  - Do rural impoundments in coastal Bay of Fundy, Canada sustain adequate habitat for wildlife?
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Canada and elsewhere in North America, impoundments are created in compensation for historic wetland loss and for habitat loss due to development projects, but these new sites are infrequently evaluated to determine how effectively they function. The Cumberland Marsh Region (CMR), located at the head of the Bay of Fundy, Canada, is of importance to migratory birds and has been subject to 300+ years of anthropogenic alteration, including impoundment creation on diked and drained tidal marsh in the last five decades. Wetland managers have noticed a pervasive decline in impoundment productivity leading to reduced waterbird usage (senescence). To understand factors that promote senescence, we analyzed abiotic and biotic proxies in sediment archives from six freshwater impoundments in two coastal watersheds to assess spatial trends across the CMR within recent decades. Our results demonstrate that impoundment productivity is driven by autochthonous nutrient sources (C/N between 7.7 and 14.4), but biogeochemical conditions can be highly variable among impoundments despite their proximity. Biogeochemical variation among top-of-core sediment samples from each impoundment was generally minimal, and thus we believe that the aging of impoundments has resulted in low productivity and organic matter accumulation due to dike stabilization and declines in nutrient loading. We conclude that these freshwater impoundments (in the CMR and likely other similar settings) are not highly productive, and may not provide abundant forage and optimal wildlife habitat which is expected of these systems; adaptive management strategies and hydrologic rehabilitation merit consideration to enhance ecological functioning. Understanding landscape attributes, hydrologic dynamics, and conditions prior to and after major human alterations should be a priority in future compensation projects.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY AMONG TROPICAL COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - To understand ecosystem functioning in coastal zones it is essential to identify the main pathways and magnitude of nutrient and organic matter fluxes. The different methods that have been applied to quantify material fluxes in tropical coastal ecosystems can be categorized into two fundamentally distinct approaches: direct flux measurements (Section 12.2) and chemical tracer techniques (Section 12.3). For direct flux measurements, the bidirectional flow of water is determined and multiplied with concentrations to obtain fluxes of inorganic nutrients or organic constituents. Water discharge can be measured directly with help of current meters and gauges, or indirectly through use of water tracers. The source of nutrients and organic matter can then be identified with help of specific chemical tracers, mainly isotopes or molecular properties. A combination of tracer techniques and direct flux measurements is most powerful to obtain quantitative information on the fluxes of organic matter and nutrients from the various sources in coastal systems but has very rarely been applied. Regarding source assessments of suspended and sedimentary organic matter, a large number of molecular biomarkers are readily available (Section 12.4). For dissolved organic matter, emerging molecular fingerprinting techniques including ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry may lead to major advances in the future.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from the Tubul-Raqui estuary (central Chile 36 degrees S)
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tubul-Raqui estuary is a coastal system off central Chile at 37 degrees S, adjacent to an active coastal upwelling area, which undergoes rapid changes associated with natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578%) and CH4 (up to 6200%) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from -319 to 714 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored.

TI  - RECENT ACCRETION IN 2 MANAGED MARSH IMPOUNDMENTS IN COASTAL LOUISIANA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent accretion was measured by the feldspar marker horizon method in two gravity-drained, managed, marsh impoundments and unmanaged reference marshes located on the rapidly subsiding coast of Louisiana. Water level management was designed to limit hydrologic exchange to the managed marsh by regulating the direction and rate of water flows. During a drawdown-flooding water management cycle, the unmanaged reference marshes had significantly higher vertical accretion rates, higher soil bulk density and soil mineral matter content, lower soil organic matter content, and higher rates of organic matter accumulation than the managed marsh. The rate of mineral matter accumulation was higher in both reference marshes, but was significantly higher in only one. Spatial variability in accumulation rates was low when analyzed in one managed marsh site, suggesting a primarily autochthonous source of matter. In contrast, the associated reference marsh apparently received allochthonous material that settled out in a distinct spatial pattern as water velocity decreased. The impoundment marshes experienced an accretion deficit of one full order of magnitude (0.1 vs. 1.0 cm/yr) based on comparison of accretion and sea level rise data, while the unmanaged reference marshes experienced a five-fold smaller deficit or no deficit. These data suggest that the gravity-drained impoundments likely have a shorter life expectancy than the reference marshes in the rapidly subsiding Louisiana coast.

TI  - The fate of organic matter sources in coastal environments: a comparison of three Mediterranean lagoons
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Trophic processes in coastal lagoons are strongly influenced by freshwater inputs and water exchanges with the sea. In recent years, stable isotope analysis has become a widespread and reliable method for the examination of trophic structure over time and space, also in complex ecosystems such as coastal lagoons. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were studied in primary producers and consumers to identify organic matter source pools from terrestrial, benthic and pelagic environments and to characterise the trophic structure in three Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Lake Fusaro, the Lake of Sabaudia and Stagnone di Marsala). The results highlighted the negligible importance of terrestrial production to higher trophic levels in all the ecosystems investigated. Consumer dependence on benthic and pelagic organic matter showed high variability: overall macroalgae were at the base of the food web in Lake Fusaro and the Lake of Sabaudia, while mixed sources (seagrass detritus, epiphytes, macroalgae and sedimentary organic matter) appeared to be the major baseline food resource in the Stagnone di Marsala. We have found evidence for significant changes in the trophic structure in these Mediterranean coastal lagoons and such differences may be triggered by differential environmental features (e.g. freshwater inputs and hydrodynamic regime).

AB  - Distichlis littoralis (Engelm.) H.L. Bell & Columbus = Monanthochloe littoralis Engelm. is a New World temperate- and subtropical-zone perennial grass that is an important species in hypersaline coastal landscapes. Also known as shoregrass, it tolerates salinities twice that of seawater. It occurs in soils low in organic matter and deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Dense, monotypic populations of D. littoralis eliminate nearly all competing annuals in harsh coastal habitats. Distichlis littoralis provides limited cover and limited nutrition for resident and migratory birds.

TI  - EFFECTS OF MANIPULATION OF FOOD-SUPPLY ON ESTUARINE MEIOBENTHOS
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative mesocosm experiment was carried out to determine the effects of natural foods of different quality and quantity on the structure of natural meiobenthic communities collected in undisturbed sediment from the polluted Westerschelde and the comparatively undisturbed Gironde estuaries. Nematode communities are more diverse and species rich in the latter estuary. The organic matter or foods used were phytoplankton, green alga, salt marsh plant detritus and leaf litter detritus which were added at three dose rates including a high dose. There was no change in community structure in response to the treatments in either of the estuarine meiobenthic communities. Analysis of all the results from this experiment indicate that the food quantity manipulations had almost no effect on the deposit feeding meiofauna. It may be that the reserves of organic matter within the sediment were sufficient to satisfy their dietary requirements for the duration of the experiment. The abundance of diatom/epigrowth feeding nematodes which were initially dominant in the Gironde, declined substantially suggesting that they may have been food limited since diatoms were not among the sources of organic matter added to the mesocosm. There was no specific response to the five different types of organic matter added to the mesocosm.

TI  - Using eDNA to determine the source of organic carbon in seagrass meadows
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses sequester globally significant amounts of carbon (C), which is stored mainly in the sediment. Both C fixation by the seagrass (autochthonous) and the trapping of organic matter that is derived from outside the ecosystem (allochthonous) contribute to seagrass sediment organic C (OC). However, due to limitations in current methods we do not yet fully understand which sources of C are most important to blue C ecosystems. We used environmental-DNA (eDNA) to identify and estimate the contribution of floral sources to seagrass sediment OC sampled from three sites in Moreton Bay, Australia that differ in potential levels of autochthonous and allochthonous OC inputs. Using the plant barcode gene rbcL and a next-generation sequencing platform we identified 150 plant operational taxonomic units in the sediment samples. We found that seagrass DNA composed on average 88% of the eDNA pool in the sediment samples. Allochtonous sources were primarily mangrove, salt-marsh, and freshwater marsh species, but the proportional contribution of other sources varied among meadows. Carbon and nitrogen (N) stable isotope mixing models suggested a lower autochthonous contribution than the eDNA data, but had high ambiguity due to indistinguishable isotopic values among some of the sources. Our study shows that eDNA can be an effective tool for identifying sources to sediment OC in blue C ecosystems and can be used in conjunction with stable isotope analysis to reduce ambiguity. Identifying the sources of OC to the sediments of blue C ecosystems is crucial for building robust and accurate C budgets for these systems.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant
CL  - Madison, WI
AB  - It is widely recognized that wetlands, especially those rich in organic matter and receiving appreciable atmospheric mercury (Hg) inputs, are important sites of methylmercury (MeHg) production. Extensive wetlands in the southeastern United States have many ecosystem attributes ideal for promoting high MeHg production rates; however, relatively few mercury cycling studies have been conducted in these environments. We conducted a landscape scale study examining Hg cycling in coastal Louisiana (USA) including four field trips conducted between August 2003 and May 2005. Sites were chosen to represent different ecosystem types, including: a large shallow eutrophic estuarine lake (Lake Pontchartrain), three rivers draining into the lake, a cypress-tupelo dominated freshwater swamp, and six emergent marshes ranging from a freshwater marsh dominated by Panicum hemitomon to a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh close to the Gulf of Mexico. We measured MeHg and total Hg (THg) concentrations, and ancillary chemical characteristics, in whole and filtered surface water, and filtered porewater.Overall, MeHg concentrations were greatest in surface water of freshwater wetlands and lowest in the profundal (non-vegetated) regions of the lake and river mainstems. Concentrations of THg and MeHg in filtered surface water were positively correlated with the highly reactive, aromatic (hydrophobic organic acid) fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These results suggest that DOC plays an important role in promoting the mobility, transport and bioavailability of inorganic Hg in these environments. Further, elevated porewater concentrations in marine and brackish wetlands suggest coastal wetlands along the Gulf Coast are key sites for MeHg production and may be a principal source of MeHg to foodwebs in the Gulf of Mexico.Examining the relationships among MeHg, THg, and DOC across these multiple landscape types is a first step in evaluating possible links between key zones for Hg(II)-methylation and the bioaccumulation of mercury in the biota inhabiting the Gulf of Mexico region.

TI  - Spatial distribution and stoichiometry of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus along an elevation gradient in a wetland in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite extensive studies on how environmental factors influence plant nutrient distribution and stoichiometry, it remains unclear how elevation affects soil distribution and stoichiometry. Here, patterns of the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were studied (with 123 soil samples) along a small-scale elevation gradient in the wetland of East Dongting Lake, China. Plant nutrient concentrations (C, N and P), soil stoichiometry (C:N, C:P and N:P ratios) and their relations with other soil properties were analysed. In addition, the spatial distributions of plant nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry were evaluated geostatistically with regression kriging, entailing estimation of regression parameters by generalized least squares and ordinary kriging of the residuals. Soil C, N and P concentrations and stoichiometry had moderate to strong spatial dependence, and the ratios of C:P and N:P had similar patterns of distribution to soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN). The SOC, TN, C:N, C:P and N:P ratios increased with increasing elevation, whereas total phosphorus (TP) showed no marked change. Furthermore, SOC, TN, C:N, C:P and N:P decreased considerably with increasing duration of submergence, soil moisture and pH. Therefore, elevation appeared to influence the distribution of plant nutrients and stoichiometry as a result of changing soil moisture and duration of submergence. HighlightsStudy showed how elevation influences plant nutrient distribution and stoichiometry. Regression kriging was used to map soil properties. Plant nutrients and stoichiometry decreased with increasing duration of submergence. Elevation affected nutrient distribution because of soil moisture and water regime.

TI  - Increased invasive potential of non-native Phragmites australis: elevated CO2 and temperature alleviate salinity effects on photosynthesis and growth
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prospective rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature may change the distribution and invasive potential of a species; and intraspecific invasive lineages may respond differently to climate change. In this study, we simulated a future climate scenario with simultaneously elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature, and investigated its interaction with soil salinity, to assess the effects of global change on the ecophysiology of two competing haplotypes of the wetland grass Phragmites australis, that are invasive in the coastal marshes of North America. The two haplotypes with the phenotypes EU-type' (Eurasian haplotype) and Delta-type' (Mediterranean haplotype), were grown at 0 parts per thousand and 20 parts per thousand soil salinity, and at ambient or elevated climatic conditions (700ppm CO2, +5 degrees C) in a phytotron system. The aboveground growth of both phenotypes was highest at the elevated climatic conditions. Growth at 20 parts per thousand salinity resulted in declined aboveground growth, lower transpiration rates (E), stomata conductance (g(s)), specific leaf area, photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and a reduced photosynthetic performance. The negative effects of salinity were, however, significantly less severe at elevated CO2 and temperature than at the ambient climatic conditions. The Delta-type P. australis had higher shoot elongation rates than the EU-type P. australis, particularly at high salinity. The Delta-type also had higher maximum light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (A(sat)), maximum carboxylation rates of Rubisco (V-cmax), maximum electron transport rates (J(max)), triose phosphate utilization rates (T-p), stomata conductance (g(s)), as well as higher Rubisco carboxylation-limited, RuBP regeneration-limited and T-p-regeneration limited CO2 assimilation rates than the EU-type under all growth conditions. Our results suggest that the EU-type will not become dominant over the Delta-type, since the Delta-type has superior ecophysiological traits. However, the projected rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature will alleviate the effects of salinity on both phenotypes and facilitate their expansion into more saline areas.

TI  - Ecological zonation of benthic foraminifera in the lower Guadiana Estuary (southeastern Portugal)
T2  - MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzes the spatial distribution and seasonal distribution of live benthic foraminiferal communities in the estuary of Guadiana, the fourth largest river on the Iberian Peninsula, and establishes, through statistical analysis, their relationships with a series of environmental parameters. Forty-four superficial sediment samples were collected along distance-to-sea and elevation gradients in the winter and summer of 2010. Fifty-three foraminifera species were identified along the intertidal margins of the estuary. Foraminiferal distribution reflected seasonal variation of environmental factors, whose relative importance varied according to species tolerances. Elevation in relation to mean sea level appeared to be the most important parameter controlling foraminiferal distribution, probably because it combines the effects of a series of other variables (i.e. organic matter, sediment texture, pH and temperature). In the highest marsh areas, where environmental conditions approach survival thresholds, only some agglutinated species are able to survive. In the lower intertidal zone, where subaerial exposure is diminished and environmental conditions are generally less variable, more diverse faunas, mainly composed of calcareous species, prevail. During winter, when fluvial discharge peaks, agglutinated species represent more than 80% of the total individuals. In summer, when marine conditions prevail, calcareous species become more competitive, increase their densities and expand into higher marsh zones and estuarine upper reaches. In the estuary, three different foraminiferal assemblages are distinguished: i) Miliammina fusca assemblage, which dominates in unvegetated areas of the lower marsh and tidal flats of the mid-upper estuary; ii)Jadammina macrescens assemblage, which dominates in the highest marsh areas in the lower estuary; and iii) Ammonia aberdoveyensis assemblage, which dominates the areas of low marsh and tidal flats of the lower estuary.

TI  - Chemical characterization of lignin preparations of fresh and decomposing Spartina anglica by pyrolysis mass spectrometry
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to determine terrestrial contributions to the organic matter pool in the marine environment, a reliable chemical tracer is required. Lignin, an abundant component of vascular plant tissue is often used as such. In this study the lignin moiety of both fresh and degraded tissue of the model halophyte Spartina anglica was purified and chemically characterized to investigate its suitability as tracer. The study can be split into three parts. In the first part several enzymatic lignin purifications of fresh S. anglica tissue were compared with each other. In the second part pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry was applied to analyse untreated and on-line methylated milled wood lignin preparations. The previous characterizations of the lignin moiety of S. anglica were used in the third part to monitor modifications in the chemical composition induced by natural aerobic decomposition in the field.The temperature at which lipids were extracted from the original tissue was not critical, although low temperatures improved the purification to some extent. For enzymatic purification of lignin the use of a polysaccharidase turned out to be the most important prerequisite. The use of a protease did not have much influence on the lignin residue. After 2 yr of aerobic decomposition, the lignin character of untreated S. anglica tissue was no longer identifiable with direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry, but it still could be retrieved in the residue obtained after enzyme treatment. With continuing decomposition the chemical structure of the lignin moieties became partly modified. The very complicated spectra obtained after longer decomposition periods suggest the formation of a heterogeneous organic fraction, probably representing "humic substances". The gradual loss of lignin characteristics in the litter makes its suitability as tracer for terrestrial material in a complex mixture of substances doubtful, at least with the analytical technique applied in this study.

TI  - Spatial variation in pore water geochemistry in a mangrove system (Pai Matos island, Cananeia-Brazil)
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variation in salinity, pH, redox potential, and in the concentrations of dissolved Mn, Fe2+ and sulphides in pore water were investigated in a mangrove system in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Total organic C (TOC), S, Fe and Mn were analyzed in the solid phase, along with acid volatile sulphide (AVS), density of roots and percentage of sand. Five zones, situated along the length of a 180 in transect were considered in the study. Four of these were colonized by different species of vascular plants (Spartina, Laguncularia, Avicennia and Rhizophora) and were denominated soils; the other was not colonized by vegetation, and was denominated sediment. The results indicated important differences between the physicochemical conditions of the pore water in the vegetated zones and the sediment. In the former, two geochemical environments were identified, based on soil depths. The upper 20 cm contained the largest quantity of roots, and the conditions were oxic (Eh > 350 mV) or suboxic (Eh: 100-350 mV), acidic, and with high concentrations of Fe and Mn in the pore water. Below this depth, the soil became anoxic, the concentration of sulphides (HS-) increased significantly and the concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn decreased significantly. The total S and the AVS fraction increased with depth, while TOC concentrations decreased, indicating that the decreases in Fe and Mn were due to the precipitation of metal sulphides. However, clear differences among the vegetated zones were not observed. The sediment was always anoxic, but with low concentrations of sulphide in the interstitial water, and was neutral or slightly alkaline. As in the soils, the concentrations of sulphides and total S increased significantly with depth, indicating that the conditions favoured the synthesis and stability of metal sulphides.

CP  - 212th ACS National Meeting
CL  - ORLANDO, FL
AB  - Humic substances, which are randomly cross-linked heterogeneous organic materials of high molecular weight, comprise a major fraction of the organic matter in soils and sediments. Because humic substances have a variety of functional groups, they play a major role in controlling the physical and chemical characteristics of natural waters, soils, and sediments. Sedimentary humic substances are considered to be the precursors of petroleum-forming kerogens. Sulfur is thought to play a major role in forming humic substances in anoxic marine sediments. Because of their structural heterogeneity, humic substances are not easily amenable to biochemical degradation and, thus, are generally considered to be biologically refractory. The complexity and heterogeneity of humic substances render;the elucidation of their chemical structure a major analytical challenge. Degradative techniques, such as pyrolysis GC-MS, can change a sample's structure during preparation and analysis and, thus, may give inaccurate. information. In this study, we investigated the sulfur-containing functional groups in humic acids from various marine sediments using XANES spectroscopy which has proved to be an important, nondestructive tool for analyzing sulfur forms. Humic acids were isolated from near-surface sediments from three locations: a salt marsh in Shelter Island, NY; the Peru Margin; and Florida Bay. We found that organic sulfides, di- and polysulfides, sulfonates, and organic sulfates are the major forms of sulfur in these sedimentary humics. The reduced-sulfur structures, organic sulfides, and di- and polysulfides, are essentially intramolecular as apposed to the highly oxidized forms of sulfur, sulfonates, and ester-bonded sulfates, which can only be present as end groups. The abundance of the reduced-sulfur structures reflects the extent to which sulfur is involved in forming intramolecular cross-links which are crucial for building up the macromolecular structures of humic substances. The significance of the presence of the different sulfur functionalities in humic substances is discussed in relation re, early diagenesis and preservation of organic matter in marine sediments.

TI  - Sources and fate of organic matter in constructed versus natural coastal waterways
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are increasingly being converted into canal estates with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. We compared the sources and fate of organic matter and water quality at four types of canal habitats (entrances and ends of canals, canal lakes and lake edges) and shallow and deep natural habitats (four replicates of each habitat). The fate of labile organic matter was assessed by measuring rates of scavenging of carrion. Surface sediments were analysed for organic carbon content and stable carbon isotopes, fatty acid biomarkers and compound specific stable isotope analysis of selected fatty acids were used to elucidate sources of sedimentary organic matter. Canal lakes differed from other habitats and were characterised by negligible scavenging, larger quantities of organic matter comprised of higher contributions from diatoms, and hypoxia. Despite some trends, natural habitats were statistically indistinguishable from canal entrances and ends. Variation among replicate habitats was large.

TI  - Natural occurrence of microbial sulphur oxidation by long-range electron transport in the seafloor
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a novel mode of sulphur oxidation was described in marine sediments, in which sulphide oxidation in deeper anoxic layers was electrically coupled to oxygen reduction at the sediment surface. Subsequent experimental evidence identified that long filamentous bacteria belonging to the family Desulfobulbaceae likely mediated the electron transport across the centimetre-scale distances. Such long-range electron transfer challenges some long-held views in microbial ecology and could have profound implications for sulphur cycling in marine sediments. But, so far, this process of electrogenic sulphur oxidation has been documented only in laboratory experiments and so its imprint on the seafloor remains unknown. Here we show that the geochemical signature of electrogenic sulphur oxidation occurs in a variety of coastal sediment environments, including a salt marsh, a seasonally hypoxic basin, and a subtidal coastal mud plain. In all cases, electrogenic sulphur oxidation was detected together with an abundance of Desulfobulbaceae filaments. Complementary laboratory experiments in intertidal sands demonstrated that mechanical disturbance by bioturbating fauna destroys the electrogenic sulphur oxidation signal. A survey of published geochemical data and 16S rRNA gene sequences identified that electrogenic sulphide oxidation is likely present in a variety of marine sediments with high sulphide generation and restricted bioturbation, such as mangrove swamps, aquaculture areas, seasonally hypoxic basins, cold sulphide seeps and possibly hydrothermal vent environments. This study shows for the first time that electrogenic sulphur oxidation occurs in a wide range of marine sediments and that bioturbation may exert a dominant control on its natural distribution.

AB  - Tidal flats are being used to understand sea level changes, pollution history, and depositional environment.. From the part of the long-term study, distribution of sediment components organic carbon, total phosphorus, and selected elements (Fe, Mn, and Cr) are used in this paper to understand diagenetic processes and hydrodynamic processes involved during the deposition of sediment. The present study revealed that the sediment components, organic carbon, and phosphorus play an important role in controlling the distribution and concentration of elements. Importance of the oxic-anoxic layer in the distribution and concentration of metals are discussed. Hydrodynamic conditions of the sediments deposited are delineated using triangular diagram.

TI  - PLASTICITY IN STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN FIMBRISTYLIS COMPLANATA (RETZ.) LINK. UNDER SALT STRESS
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fimbristylis complanata (Retz.) Link. is a halophytic sedge and commonly found in salt-affected wetlands and salt marshes. This species is less explored, particularly no information available on salinity tolerance in the literature. In the present work, structural and functional modifications of photosynthesis in F. complanata were evaluated under salt stress. A complete randomized design with three replications and three salt regimes (0, 200 and 400 mM NaCl) were maintained throughout the experiment. Population SH collected from the highest saline habitat (ECe 49.28 dS m-1) ranked as the highest tolerant, which showed an increase in biomass and chlorophyll pigments under salt stress. Modification in gas exchange parameters include decline in transpiration rate (E), while increase water use efficiency (WUE) and net CO2 assimilation rate (Pn), while structural modifications in SH population include increase in leaf succulence, cortical region thickness, bulliform thickness, aerenchyma formation, metaxylem and phloem area. Moderately saline population KM (ECe 29.56 dS m-1) exhibited significant alterations, like E (transiently up to 200 mM NaCl) and maintence of Pn up to 400 mM. This population altered leaf structural and epidermal traits related to photosynthetic efficiency. Least saline population LR (ECe 21.49 dS m-1) accumulates high chlorophyll content, increased leaf succulence and secured higher abaxial stomatal density. Present results suggest that F. complanata could proficiently maintain photosynthesis by several structural and functional modifications.

TI  - Open bays as nurseries for Louisiana brown shrimp
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies of Louisiana estuaries have indicated a central role of Spartina alterniflora marshes in supporting production of the commercially important brown shrimp, Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Brown shrimp are an estuarine-dependent species and spend one to three springtime months in estuaries as small juveniles, with highest shrimp densities found at marsh edges. Later estuarine and offshore production of brown shrimp is correlated both with marsh area and with abundance of smaller juveniles found in unvegetated open bays near marshes. This paper investigates the idea that open bays are an additional important nursery habitat for Louisiana brown shrimp, with bays possibly supporting the bulk of shrimp populations even while shrimp densities expressed on a square meter basis are lower in the bays. To assay possible differences in shrimp abundances and residency in marsh ponds vs. adjacent open bays, springtime field work was conducted in 2004-2006 near the Louisiana University Marine Consortium Laboratory at Cocodrie, Louisiana. Seine surveys showed similar-sized shrimp were present in marsh ponds (< 20 m in diameter) and an adjacent open bay (< 1 m deep, 2 km in diameter) and that shrimp were twice as dense in the marsh ponds. Natural C, N, and S isotope tags provided distinctive labeling of shrimp from marsh ponds versus bays; shrimp residency appeared high in both areas with < 10% of shrimp present as immigrants from other areas. Widely spaced collections from several Louisiana bay systems and also Galveston Bay, Texas showed that the S isotope tags provided the most general tags for marsh origins, with low S isotope values of 1-9 parts per thousand in shrimp muscle tissue consistently indicating marsh origins. Importance of marshes for brown shrimp production across Terrebonne and Barataria Bays, Louisiana was evaluated with S isotopes using spring 2005 collections. Results showed that marshes supported about 1/3 of total shrimp production; 2/3 of Louisiana brown estuarine shrimp production may depend on the three to four times more extensive open bays. Given these results, coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana might focus on measures such as barrier island conservation and restoration that protect both bays and marshes, rather than focusing on measures that specifically target marshes and neglect open bays.

TI  - EFFECTS OF 2 LOUISIANA MARSH MANAGEMENT PLANS ON WATER AND MATERIALS FLUX AND SHORT-TERM SEDIMENTATION
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of two coastal Louisiana marsh management plans on water and materials flux, shortterm sedimentation, and several soil parameters was evaluated between May 1989 and January 1990. The study was carried out in the Fina-Laterre Marsh Management Area and the Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in managed and unmanaged areas. Water and material flux was measured each two hours during twelve 48 h flux studies, and net fluxes per m(2) of drainage area were calculated for water, total suspended sediments, salinity, NO3+NO2, PO4, and NH4. Short-term sedimentation was measured as the weight of material deposited over 2-4 week intervals on petri dishes placed on the marsh surface. The managed sites experienced considerable reductions in total water exchange, leading to reductions in net material exchanges. when expressed on a per m(2) basis, the managed wetlands are much less tightly coupled to the surrounding estuary compared to unmanaged areas. Within the context of a general decrease of exchange, the two managed areas on average export materials to the estuary. In the managed areas, the results suggest that management can lead to reduced salinity and a loss of sediments and nutrients. Short-term sedimentation was less at the managed areas; expressed as g m(-2)d(-1), total sedimentation rates were 0.57 for Fina managed, 1.02 for Fina unmanaged, 1.68 for Rockefeller managed, and 3.82 for Rockefeller unmanaged. Soil P was lower and soil organic matter was higher at the managed areas. Organic matter in the soil was low compared with recently deposited material, suggesting that most organic matter deposited on the surface of the marsh is lost through decomposition. Reduction of flooding during storm events is the likely mechanism leading to reduced sedimentation on the marsh surface in the managed areas.

TI  - Trophic ecology of dominant zooplankton and macrofauna in a temperate, oligotrophic South African estuary: a fatty acid approach
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fatty acid profiles of food sources, dominant zooplankton, macrofauna and a few small ichthyofauna in a temperate estuary on the southeastern coast of South Africa were used to trace the original carbon sources and the degree of feeding plasticity of consumers within an oligotrophic environment. Fatty acid analysis is seldom used to examine food web ecology in estuaries, as these systems are typically highly complex owing to the variety of potential food sources and the variable nature of detritus. We hypothesized that generalist consumers would exhibit similar and overlapping fatty acid compositions, whereas any specialist consumers would 'stand out' as they may contain high proportions of fatty acids specific to their preferred food sources. Within-species variation was very small in the food sources, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed resolution of most species and sample types into distinct clusters. Variation of fatty acid composition was greater within the consumers, with PCA resolving several clusters by collection location within the site and feeding mode of the animals (suspension feeders, grazers and omnivores). We considered the fatty acid profiles (with particular reference to polyunsaturated fatty acids and essential fatty acids) of the consumers in relation to the food sources to determine which organisms played significant roles in the sequestration and cycling of high quality organic material within the estuary.

TI  - Spatial analysis of carbon isotopes reveals seagrass contribution to fishery food web
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the widespread use of carbon stable isotopes to distinguish among potential energy pathways in food webs, their usefulness is limited where potential basal carbon sources are numerous and diverse. We measured carbon isotope values of the major fisheries species, the mostly carnivorous Scylla serrata (giant mud crab), and potential basal, autotrophic sources supporting the food web. Conventional mixing modelling of autotroph and crab isotope data could not differentiate contributions from different sources. Pooling of modelled contributions from sources with similar isotope values indicated a role for organic matter from seagrass meadows or saltmarshes, but still did not define contributions well. Crab isotope data from a subsequent, spatially explicit survey of 14 sites, selected to represent different distances from key habitats, were analyzed using multiple regression. Crab isotope values showed a significant relationship with distance from seagrass (R-2 = 0.87), but not with distance from mangroves or saltmarsh grass. Alongside seagrass meadows, crabs had very enriched isotope values, demonstrating their reliance on sources with enriched isotope values (seagrass and algae epiphytic on seagrass, 65-90% of their energy intake). At the site furthest from seagrass (21 km), crabs assimilated carbon primarily from depleted sources such as mangroves and terrestrial organic matter from coastal catchments (70-85%). Explicit spatial analysis of isotope data following a comprehensive survey revealed energy pathways not evident in conventional analyses.

TI  - Nutrient gradients in Panamanian estuaries: effects of watershed deforestation, rainfall, upwelling, and within-estuary transformations
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - To test whether deforestation of tropical forests alters coupling of watersheds, estuaries, and coastal waters, we measured nutrients in 8 watershed-estuarine systems on the Pacific coast of Panama where watershed forest cover ranged from 23 to 92%. Watersheds with greater forest cover discharged larger dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and higher N/P into estuary headwaters. As freshwater mixed with seawater down-estuary, within-estuary biogeochemical processes erased the imprint of watershed deforestation, increased ammonium, lowered nitrate concentrations, and otherwise altered down-estuary water column composition. As estuarine water left man grove estuaries, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, but not dissolved organic nitrogen, were exported to receiving near-shore waters. Mangrove estuaries in this region thus provide important ecological services, by uncoupling coastal waters from changes in terrestrial land covers, as well as by subsidizing adjoined receiving coastal waters by providing nutrients. The pattern of land-sea coupling and exports was disrupted during La Nina-influenced conditions. In one instance when La Nina conditions led to upwelling of deeper layers, high concentrations of marine-derived ammonium were inserted into estuaries. In another instance, La Nina-associated high rainfall diluted nutrient concentrations within estuaries and lowered salinity regionally, and the fresher upper layer impaired coastal upwelling. Regional rainfall has increased during the last decade. If La Nina rainfall continues to increase, disruptions of current land-estuary-sea couplings may become more frequent, with potentially significant changes in nutrient cycles and ecological services in these coupled ecosystems.

T2  - ESTUARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The uptake and release of materials by intertidal mussel beds were directly measured in two cultivated Dutch estuaries. Generally, chlorophyll a, seston, and particulate organic carbon were taken up, while ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicate were released. The observed rates were higher than values computed from organismic observations and similar to those observed for intertidal oyster reefs in South Carolina. Specific estuarine material turnover rates varied from 1 week to 38 weeks when calculated with mussel bed fluxes. The fastest turnover rates were for chlorophyll a and ammonium. These results support the idea that dense assemblages of bivalves are major components in the recycling of nutrients in estuaries.

The two terrestrial ecotypes, DR and HSMR, had denser vascular system, more and longer BSC chloroplasts and higher capacity of CO2 concentrating mechanism of NAD-ME subtype as compared with the SR ecotype. The enhanced NADP-ME pathway in the HSMR might contribute to its adaptation to the salinity habitat.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the recognition of the relationship between microbial conditioning and invertebrate feeding, there has been little communication between microbial ecologists and zoologists studying the processing of leaf litter in streams. An appraisal of suitable methods is timely, to encourage workers to critically examine their experimental approach: it is often forgotten that results are determined largely by the methods used. We review some recent studies, emphasizing the application of microbiological and biochemical methods, and discuss some important decisions that must be made in experimental design and implementation. It is recommended that newly fallen, naturally abscissed leaves, bound in leaf packs and tethered to natural substrata, be used in studies attempting to simulate natural leaf decomposition. Drying and leaching leaves under extreme conditions should be avoided. Mass loss should not simply be equated with decomposition; instead, losses of the main types of chemical constituents of plant litter should be quantified. If the aim is to study decomposition rather than merely leaf breakdown, the metabolism of dissolved matter and fine particulate material lost from the decaying leaf must be addressed as well. Appropriate techniques should be used to study microbial assemblages: lipid biomarkers or nucleic-acid methods for assemblage composition, microscopy or biochemical analysis for microbial biomass, [H-3]-thymidine or [H-3]-leucine methods to determine growth rates. Exponential decay curves and processing coefficients should be used cautiously, especially if sample sizes are small and equal throughout the study.

TI  - Combined Effects of Global Climate Suitability and Regional Environmental Variables on the Distribution of an Invasive Marsh Species Spartina alterniflora
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion by Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem along Chinese coast. Determining the main influential factors and their relationships with the distribution of S. alterniflora is thus crucial for invasion control. However, the distribution is influenced by environmental variables at different scales and the relative importance of cross-scale variables is unclear. Based on the MaxEnt modelling technique, a combined regional environmental niche (CREN) model was built by integrating the global climate niche (GCN) model into the regional environment niche (REN) model to study the combined effects of global climate suitability and regional environmental variables on species distribution. The CREN model performed much better than the GCN model with AUC, TSS, specificity and sensitivity values increasing by 0.12, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.45, whereas it performed as well as the REN model, but reduced the overfitting. When considering the combined effects, the predicted suitable area decreased from 66.90% at the global scale to 18.53% at the regional scale. Global sensitivity analysis showed there were strong interactions among different variables, especially for elevation and global climate suitability, the most influential variables. Interactions reduced the importance of soil salinity, but enhanced that of soil percentage sand. The presence probability increased with increasing of global climate suitability and soil salinity, while decreased with increasing of elevation, soil organic carbon and percentage sand. The presence probability was the highest in moderately well drained and lowest in poorly drained soil. Ignoring the combined effects of cross-scale variables will prevent comprehensive elucidation of their relationship with species distribution, which should be considered to take effective measures against biological invasion.

TI  - Manganese(iv) oxide amendments reduce methylmercury concentrations in sediment porewater
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Manganese(iv) oxide (pyrolusite, birnessite) mineral amendments can reduce dissolved MeHg concentrations in sediment theoretically by inhibiting microbial sulfate reduction, which is a major methylation pathway in sediments. Anaerobic sediment slurry microcosms in which Hg methylation was stimulated by addition of labile organic carbon (acetate) and HgCl2 showed that manganese(iv) oxide reduced the percent MeHg in slurry porewater (filtered), by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to controls. Sediment-water mesocosms with pyrolusite or birnessite either directly mixed into the top 5 cm or applied in a thin (5 cm) sand layer over sediment showed reductions in percent MeHg in porewater of 66-69% for pyrolusite and 81-89% for birnessite amendment. A thin sand layer alone resulted in 65% reduction. CO2 respirometry experiments showed that the amendments stimulated microbial activity. Microbial community census by PCR and DNA sequencing indicated that the addition of Mn(iv) oxides did not significantly alter the indigenous sediment microbial community structure, although a small increase in abundance of iron and manganese reducers was observed after a 2 week incubation period. The mechanism of decreasing MeHg relative to Hg concentrations in porewater likely involved an increase in the importance of Mn(iv) reduction (relative to sulfate reduction) in heterotrophic microbial metabolism in the sediments amended with Mn(iv) oxides. Manganese reduction was confirmed as the predominant biogeochemical redox process by microelectrode voltammetry profiling of the sediment microcosms, although adsorption to Mn oxide surfaces, enhanced MeHg demethylation, and abiotic reduction of Mn(iv) also may have been involved in reducing percent MeHg and suppressing net MeHg production. These results represent a novel approach for mitigating MeHg impacts from sediments with potential applicability to a range of aquatic settings including intertidal zones, tidal marshes, seasonal wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes.

TI  - Temperature-driven decoupling of key phases of organic matter degradation in marine sediments
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term burial of organic carbon in sediments results in the net accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, thereby mediating the redox state of the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. Sediment microbial activity plays a major role in determining whether particulate organic carbon is recycled or buried. A diverse consortium of microorganisms that hydrolyze, ferment, and terminally oxidize organic compounds mediates anaerobic organic matter mineralization in anoxic sediments. Variable temperature regulation of the sequential processes, leading from the breakdown of complex particulate organic carbon to the production and subsequent consumption of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved intermediates, could play a key role in controlling rates of overall organic carbon mineralization. We examined sediment organic carbon cycling in a sediment slurry and in flow through bioreactor experiments. The data show a variable temperature response of the microbial functional groups mediating organic matter mineralization in anoxic marine sediments, resulting in the temperature-driven decoupling of the production and consumption of organic intermediates. This temperature-cl riven decoupling leads to the accumulation of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved organic carbon at low temperatures and low-molecular weight dissolved organic carbon limitation of terminal metabolism at higher temperatures.

TI  - Determinants of floristic diversity and vegetation composition on the islands of Lake Burollos, Egypt
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - . A floristic and environmental survey was carried out on 22 uninhabited islands (0.1-8.4 ha) in Lake Burollos, Egypt. A total of 58 vascular plant species was recorded. The number of habitats on each island was counted. There was a positive correlation between island area and number of habitat types. Island area was significantly positively correlated with various measures of floristic diversity, including the total number of species present, and the numbers of annual, herbaceous, and shrublet species. Perennial and shrub species numbers did not differ significantly with island area. In addition to island area, elevation and soil salinity, as well as distance to the Mediterranean Sea, all contributed significantly to variation in species composition in the terrestrial habitats. Water salinity and transparency accounted for 69% of the variation in aquatic species numbers. There was a weak effect of isolation on similarity of species composition on islands. Eight vegetation types, represented by 13 indicator species identified after TWINSPAN analysis, were distinguished by soil characteristics. Species richness was inversely correlated with clay, organic carbon and total nitrogen in the soil, but positively correlated with calcium carbonate content. From a management perspective, long-term monitoring of threatened habitats in the lake is urgently required as a starting point to preserve biodiversity. Finally, we conclude that the present study supports the hypothesis indicating that larger areas feature higher species richness due to increased numbers of habitats.

AB  - Sediment from a microbial mat from the South-West coast of the Netherlands consumed dimethylsulfide (DMS) under oxic and anoxic conditions. From this sediment, a Gram-negative, oval DMS oxidizing bacterium, strain RB-1, was isolated. Its substrate range is typical of an obligately methylotrophic organism. Enzyme analysis revealed the presence of the ribulose monophosphate pathway for carbon assimilation, and the ability to use the linear dissimilatory pathway via Formate to carbon dioxide, as well as the cyclic pathway via the ribulose monophosphate route for carbon dissimilation. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed high similarity with species belonging to the genus Methylophaga. Because of the specific dimethylsulfide and hydrogen sulfide oxidizing capacity, the new isolate was named Methylophaga sulfidovorans.

TI  - Environmental Impact of Long Piers on Tidal Marshes in Maryland-Vegetation, Soil, and Marsh Surface Effects
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Piers may impact the health of coastal wetlands by altering vegetation, soil organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition or erosion. Permit requests for piers have recently increased in the U.S. leading to concern by environmental regulatory agencies on potential impacts. In response, a project was conducted in Maryland to assess the impacts of long piers on plant communities, soils, and marsh surface characteristics. Twenty sites with piers and 20 control sites were assessed. Control sites and pier sites were similar with respect to soil types, marsh surface characteristics, and plant community composition. Shading consistently reduced vegetation density directly beneath piers and occasionally reduced vegetation density adjacent to piers. Shading favored Spartina alterniflora over Distichlis spicata, and Distichlis spicata over Spartina patens. Distribution of marsh surface components (high marsh, low marsh, mudflats, open water) was unaffected by proximity to piers. Direct evidence of pier effects on erosion or deposition was limited to the immediate vicinity of a few piers. In general, thickness of the organic horizons or that of the root mats was unaffected by proximity to a pier. We concluded that any effects of piers on vegetation or erosion were restricted to the close proximity of the piers.

TI  - Assessment of sediment penetrability as an integrated in situ measure of intertidal soft-sediment conditions
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Infauna have an intimate relationship with the sediments they inhabit, and any study conducted upon infauna must, at the very least, describe sediment conditions. Common sediment assessments in intertidal systems include particle size distribution, as well as water and organic matter contents. These measures require extracting and processing a sediment core, and this disturbance may result in data that do not necessarily reflect in situ conditions. Sediment penetrability measured in situ using a penetrometer can circumvent this limitation. However, relationships between sediment penetrability and other sediment variables are poorly understood, especially in coastal systems. We evaluated the relationship between sediment penetrability and depth to the apparent redox potential discontinuity, mean particle size, organic matter content, and water content on tidal flats along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada. We also assessed whether adding penetrability into environmental models of the infaunal community improved model performance. We observed that while penetrability is statistically related to other sediment variables, relationships to covariates were weak. Further, inclusion of penetrability with other sediment variables improved the performance of models predicting infaunal community composition. Therefore, penetrability can be considered a separate variable, and contributes to an integrated assessment of environmental conditions experienced by biota. Finally, since we evaluated this method in different soft-sediment intertidal ecosystems (mudflats to sandflats), this method is applicable to a range of systems in other geographical areas.

TI  - Managing critical transition zones
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems that function as critical transition zones (CTZs) among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats are closely connected to the ecosystems adjacent to them and are characterized by a rapid flux of materials and organisms. CTZs play various roles, including mediating water flows, accumulating sediments and organic matter, processing nutrients, and providing opportunities for recreation. They are particularly difficult to manage because they tend to be small, albeit important, components of large watersheds, and managers may not have control over the entire landscape. Moreover, they are often the focus of intensive human activity. Consequently, CTZs are critically important zones, and their preservation and protection are likely to require unique collaboration among scientists, managers, and stakeholders. Scientists can learn a great deal from the study of these ecosystems, taking advantage of small size and the importance of fluxes, but a good understanding of adaptive management strategies is needed to establish a dialogue with managers and stakeholders on technical and management issues. An understanding of risk analysis is also important to help set meaningful goals and establish logical strategies that include all of the interested parties. Successful restoration of a CTZ is the best test of the quality of knowledge about its structure and function. Much has already been learned about coastal CTZs through restoration projects, and the large number of such projects involving riparian CTZs in particular suggests that there is considerable opportunity for fruitful collaborations between scientists and managers.

TI  - Distribution of microbial communities associated with the dominant high marsh plants and sediments of the United States east coast
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial communities in the sediment and associated with the dominant type of standing dead plant were collected from the high marsh zones of 10 sites along the eastern coast of the United States from Maine to Florida. Microbial community composition was examined using T-RFLP, and bacterial and fungal abundance was determined microscopically. Within the sediment, community composition was strongly correlated with latitude, indicating that biogeographical factors are important determinants of sediment community composition, whereas abundance was positively and strongly correlated with sediment organic matter content. A strong biogeographical effect was observed for both bacterial and fungal abundance on standing dead plants, but there was no clear relationship between community composition and latitude. Microbial community composition was more similar among plants of the same type (i.e., related plant species) suggesting that plant type (i.e., substrate quality) is primarily responsible for the determining community composition on standing dead plants.

TI  - Abiotic Factors Influencing the Distribution of Vegetation in Coastal Estuary of the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are divergent views about the dominant factors controlling vegetation distribution in coastal deltas. To determine the dominant factors controlling vegetation distribution, we explored the relationships between six abiotic factors (annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil organic matter, soil moisture, soil salinity, soil pH) and vegetation patterns along a belt transect throughout seven vegetation zones (bare beach, seepweed, common reed, meadow, rice, maize, woods) in the Liaohe Delta. The methods of data analysis included the Kriging interpolation method, grade-ranks method, correlation analysis, Euclidean distance analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis. Contrary to the view that climate controls vegetation pattern, our results suggested that climate had a limited influence on vegetation pattern. Edaphic factors were shown to exert the strongest influence on vegetation pattern, with soil salinity being identified as the dominant factor, followed by soil moisture, soil pH, and soil organic matter.

M3  - Article
AB  - The mineral nutrient content of goose forage was determined and the chemical nature of soils producing the foods was assessed. Soils associated soil water and grasses and grass-like plants growing in the soils were sampled on 7 estuaries between the Missisicabi and Hayes rivers. Most of the sites were underlain by calcareous mineral soils and the only non-calcareous site had mildly alkaline to neutral pH. Average organic matter content of soils under Carex fens was 23.0% and 1.46% under other vegetation types. P fertility was low in southern James Bay but high at other sites. Total S ranged from 504-1115 ppm among the estuaries and of this an average of 37% was soluble in sodium bicarbonate solution. Interstitial water that readily drained from the surface soils of the estuaries varied greatly in salinity, even within a vegetation type, but, in general, the waters were highly mineralized. Plant biomass ranged from 18-610 g/m2. Variability within a given meadow was small compared with differences for the same vegetation  type among estuaries. Analyses for P, Ca, Mg, K and Na revealed the tissues to be mineral rich and that plants represent a nutritious forage for geese. Data for N, S, and non-structural carbohydrate indicate that protein nutrition should be adequate and that oligosaccharides and simpler sugars are available for lipogenesis. The forage of the estuarine meadows is generally as nutritious as that in the temperate grasslands of north central USA and adjacent Canada.

TI  - FINE SCALE MEIOFAUNAL DISTRIBUTION AROUND BURROWS OF OCYPODOIDS (DECAPODA, OCYPODOIDEA) IN TIDAL FLAT SEDIMENTS
T2  - CRUSTACEANA
M3  - Article
AB  - In tidal flat sediments, larger invertebrates often modify the sedimentary environment in a manner that causes smaller animals, such as meiofauna, to become more abundant. In other words, macrofauna can "promote" meiofauna. In summer (August) and autumn (November/early December) 2007, we investigated centimetre-scale horizontal and vertical profiles of total metazoan meiofaunal abundance and community structure around burrows of Uca lactea (De Haan, 1835) (fiddler crabs) and Scopimera globosa (De Haan, 1835) (sand bubbler crabs) on an intertidal sandflat of the Amakusa Islands, western Japan. Meiofaunal community structure changed significantly with sediment depth around burrows of U. lactea in both seasons, whereas vertical differences were less clear for S. globosa. Although no evidence was found that total meiofaunal abundance or the abundances of certain taxonomic groups were positively influenced by burrows of S. globosa, the abundance of nematodes in subsurface sediment around burrows of U. lactea was significantly higher than in controls in autumn. High concentrations of fresh organic matter had not accumulated in the sediment around burrows of either species of crab. Uca lactea, however, made its burrows in significantly finer sediment than did S. globosa. One possibility is that differences in meiofaunal distribution in sediment around the burrows of the two crabs were the result of habitat and behavioural differences between the species.

TI  - Seasonal changes in sediment erodibility associated with biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal environment, St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sediment dynamics and the long-term evolution of intertidal environments depend on the erosion threshold, which is often increased by microbial biofilms. Intertidal biostabilization has been well studied in temperate and subtropical environments, but little is known for subarctic conditions with strong seasonal changes in vegetation cover and sea ice presence in winter because of the difficulty in studying the sediments under ice cover. The present project investigated the role of biofilms and their seasonal as well as spatial variations for sediment biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal area near Rimouski (Quebec, Canada). Grain size distribution reflected a seaward increasing trend in sand content and mean grain size. The poor sorting of sediments results from the contribution of sediment transport by ice rafting in addition to the hydrodynamic transport processes in this subarctic intertidal area. A Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) was used to measure the erosion threshold (tau(crit)) across the entire intertidal area. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and extra polymeric substances (EPS) were measured in the top 3 mm. The high marsh had a far higher tau(crit) than the low marsh, but there was much less variation between low marsh, mudflat and sandflat. tau(crit )was significantly correlated with Chl a, elevation, and organic matter content. EPS was not a good indicator for tau(crit), except for the low marsh/high marsh difference. The results showed a seasonal cycle in intertidal bed emdibility. Lower intertidal areas had highest tau(crit) in autumn during the storm season, followed by lowest tau(crit) in winter under sea-ice cover, and no major difference between summer and spring. This study highlights the characteristics of cold climate intertidal areas, where low temperatures in autumn and land-fast ice cover during winter severely affect biofilms and intertidal vegetation, and ultimately their capacity to shield sediments from erosion.

TI  - Root architecture of six tropical seagrass species, growing in three contrasting habitats in Indonesian waters
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although several recent studies point at the importance of seagrass roots for nutrient acquisition in oligotrophic tropical ecosystems, remarkably little is known about the root architecture of tropical seagrasses. The present study provides a detailed description of the root architecture of six seagrass species that were extracted from three sites differing in sediment type and nutrient availability (i.e., except for one species that was not present at one of the sites). Number of roots per node, order of root branching, length and diameter per root order, root hair density and length were determined and used to calculate a topological index for the different species and habitats. Root architecture differed strongly between species. The relatively long-lived and slowly-growing species Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were characterised by short internodes with relatively few unbranched roots per node and a high root hair density. More fast growing species such as Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Syringodium isoetifolium had many roots per node, the majority of which were branched. Surprisingly, differences in sediment type and nutrient availability, as present between locations, had little effect on root architecture. We expect this to be due to a relatively homogeneous nutrient distribution at the small scale within water saturated sediments. Overall, all seagrass species had relatively simple branching (topological index > 0.7), comparable to angiosperms of the low temperate salt marsh. We speculate that relatively simple root architecture of plants in flooded systems reflects the need for a minimal path length for oxygen transport from shoots to roots.

TI  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange in a temperate cattail marsh in relation to biophysical properties
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured at a temperate cattail marsh using the eddy covariance technique in order to examine the relationships between NEE, weather, and vegetation properties. Analyses of CO2 fluxes for a complete year (May 9, 2005 to May 30, 2006) showed that the marsh wetland was a net CO2 sink for each month from June to September (monthly 24-h averages of -0.1, -5.1, -4.8, and -2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively) and a source of CO2 to the atmosphere for the remaining fall and winter months. Wintertime (November to April) average NEE was 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1). The annual cumulative CO2 balance shows a net uptake of 264 g C m(-2) year(-1) by the marsh. Ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were estimated to be 567 and 831 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Respiration rates were associated with a Q(10) value of 2.8. Peak aboveground biomass (average of 1156 g m(-2)) and peak green LAI (average of 3.63) were reached in mid-August. Variations in growing season NEE were well correlated with variations in live biomass (r = 0.92) and green LAI (r = 0.94). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sulphur speciation in anoxic hypersaline sediments from the eastern Mediterranean Sea
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The anoxic hypersaline Tyro and Bannock Basins are among the most sulphidic bodies of water in the marine environment (H2S > 2 mM). We report the distribution of elemental sulphur, Acid Volatile Sulphur (AVS), organic polysulphides, humic sulphur (0.5 M NaOH extractable), and pyritic sulphur in the sediments from these basins. Pyritic sulphur appears to be the main phase of inorganic reduced sulphur (50-80% of the total sulphur pool) and is at the same level (about 250 mu moles per gram dry weight) in cores recovered from the two basins. Remarkably, humic sulphur has been found to account for 17-28% of the total sulphur pool in the Tyro Basin, and for 10-43% in the Bannock Basin. Sulphur isotope data show negative delta(34)S values for both pyritic sulphur (delta(34)S: -19 parts per thousand to -39 parts per thousand) and humic sulphur(delta(34)S: -15 parts per thousand to -30 parts per thousand). This indicates that both pyritic and humic sulphur originate from microbially produced H2S.Neither basin shows a significant correlation between pyritic sulphur and organic carbon, suggesting syngenetic pyrite formation. Additionally, the degree of pyritization in these sediments (DOP is 0.62) indicates that pyrite formation is limited by the reactivity of Fe. Humic sulphur correlates with the pyritic sulphur distribution and seems to be related with gelatinous pellicles (bacterial mats at the interface between oxic seawater and brine). Both pyritic and humic sulphur can be formed in the water column at the interface of oxic seawater and brine by a syngenetic pathway; about 5% of the pyrite is formed in the sediments by diagenetic processes. The presence of a bacterial mat and high H2S content in the brines favour such conditions. However, most of the humic sulphur inventory can be supported by diagenetic processes. Although these basins differ in their major element chemistry, their reduced sulphur species chemistry appears to be similar. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In a saltmarsh in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Spartina alterniflora had a 5 month growing period. Shoot extension was highest between July and August, and the largest number of leaves were added between June and July. Some leaves began to senesce in the first month of the growing season, but over 50% remained alive until September. Approximately 20% of the leaves became detached from the plant between May and December. Between September and December (snowfall), such leaves lost over 60% of their mass. Compared to predried leaves in litterbags, naturally decaying leaves accumulated more fungal species (16 vs. 9) and ergosterol (up to 125 mu g g(-1) vs. less than or equal to 50 mu g g(-1)), and fewer bacteria. Losses of mass, phenolics, and sugars in the first 14 days were higher in litterbag leaves.

TI  - Grasslandification has significant impacts on soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus of alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use will alter soil profiles of wetlands under climatic change and human disturbance, especially through grasslandification. Grasslandification is the process where a wetland is drained and converted to pasture. Grasslandificationon on the Tibetan plateau has been intensive over the last 40 years, mostly from drainage by humans. However, many previous studies have generally analysed only wetland ecological processes, despite the fact that grasslandificaiton, the biggest change process on the Tibetan plateau, has resulted from social and economic stresses. The assessment of changes to the soil C, N and P by grasslandification is the key to understanding the contribution to carbon management from alpine wetlands and variation of soil nutrition. We experimentally investigated the effect of grasslandification on soil physical (water, pH and EC) and chemical profiles (C, N and P) in grasslandification-pasture plots and reference wetland plots based on previous remote sensing results of the Maqu alpine wetland on the Tibetan plateau. The grasslandification process of alpine wetlands reduced vegetation quality and increased degree of drought, especially relevant with heavy grazing of the pasture. In general, grasslandification reduced the C, N and P content of soils and increased pH and EC, all significantly associated with variation to the vegetation and soil water. Soil C has changed more than N, P with grasslandification, but the soil C: N: P ratio has been relatively stable, and grasslandification has lead the wetland to the habitat with nitrogen limited. Thus, the grasslandification process of alpine wetlands on the Tibetan plateau over the last 40 years has increased net carbon emissions from alpine wetland soil contributions to atmospheric CO2. The grasslandification of alpine wetland is a drying process and observed changes were mainly influenced by variations of soil water and nutrients. Maintaining vegetation and soil water is an important approach to mitigating soil degradation and carbon emissions from alpine wetlands. In consideration of the current social and economic status of the study site, it is difficult to return or restore the grasslandification area to the original wetland, so the better strategy is to protect the existing wetland and reduce the human disturbance.

TI  - LONG-TERM N-15-NITROGEN RETENTION IN THE VEGETATED SEDIMENTS OF A NEW-ENGLAND SALT-MARSH
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - N-15 was used in a 7-yr field study and a laboratory investigation of a single growing season to quantify the amount, timing, and mechanisms of annual N retention and loss in the plant-sediment system of a short Spartina alterniflora marsh. There was an initial rapid loss of similar to 25% of the added (NH4+)-N-15 through nitrification-denitrification at a rate of 25.2 mg N m(-2) d(-1), with the remaining label being incorporated into plant tissues. Label losses decreased throughout the study as N-15 was increasingly sequestered in the dead organic N pool. About 40% of the injected label remained after seven growing seasons. Total annual N losses were 7.3-7.6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) based on N-15 losses and estimates of the actively cycling N pool. Export accounted for 26-44% and denitrification for 54-77% of the total N loss. Burial of N in dead belowground organic matter was 3.7-4.1 g N m(-2) yr(-1), similar to estimates determined from accretion and total sediment N data. Recycling of N through translocation from aboveground to belowground biomass and remineralization of dead belowground biomass was the major pathway in the sediment N cycle, equivalent to 67-79% of the annual plant N demand. Annual N losses were balanced by inputs, primarily N, fixation. Long-term N retention appears to be controlled primarily by the competition for DIN between the plants and bacterial nitrifiers-denitrifiers and secondarily by the relative incorporation of N into aboveground vs. belowground biomass.

TI  - Formation and burial of pyrite and organic sulfur in mud sediments of the East China Sea inner shelf: Constraints from solid-phase sulfur speciation and stable sulfur isotope
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Solid-phase sulfur speciation and stable sulfur isotopic compositions are used to elucidate the formation and burial of pyrite-sulfur (S-py) and organic sulfur (OS) at three selected sites in mud sediments of the East China Sea (ECS) inner shelf, and to infer potential factors influencing the preservation of Spy and OS in the sediments. Our results in combination with previous studies show that the overall reactivity of sedimentary organic matter (OM) is low, while OM at the site impacted by frequent algal-bloom events displays somewhat enhanced reactivity. We observed characteristically low contents of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and S-py in the sediments, which can be attributed to low sulfate reduction rate due to high redox potential together with limited availability of labile OM. Several geochemical features, for example, persistent occurrence of S-0, good coupling among the profiles of AVS, S-0 and S-py, and large S-34(py) depletion, all suggest that the polysulfide pathway and disproportionation are likely involved in the pyrite formation. Organic sulfur amounts in the sediments are at the lower end of OS contents reported in many other marine sediments around the world. The sources of OS are both biosynthetic and diagenetic, with the biosynthetic OS being the major share (59-73%). In one site studied (C702), enhanced accumulation of OS within the upper layers (14 cm) is believed to be associated with frequent algal-bloom events. Net burial fluxes of S-py and OS in the three sites studied range from 0.27 to 0.82 mmol/m(2)/d and from 0.22 to 0.74 mmol/m(2)/d, respectively. Sedimentation rate and algal-bloom events are two important factors influencing the spatial variability of S-py and OS burial fluxes in the whole shelf. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Foraminiferal biofacies across mangrove-mudflat environments at Cocoa Creek, north Queensland, Australia
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Contemporary and relict (subsurface) intertidal foraminiferal dead assemblages were collected from a site near to Cocoa Creek, north Queensland, Australia, and analysed for the purpose of understanding fossil assemblage development and preservation. A marked dichotomy was identified between dead foraminiferal assemblages within mangrove sediments and those within adjacent mudflat sediments. Mangrove assemblages were almost exclusively represented by agglutinated species (mainly Arenoparrella mexicana, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Milliammina fusca, M. obliqua, Trochammina inflata) while calcareous species dominated the mudflat (mainly Ammonia aoteana, Pararotalia venusta, Parrellina hispidula). Surface and subsurface test abundances were also an order of magnitude greater within mudflat sediments (1000-3000 tests per cm(3)) than in the sediments beneath the mangroves (100-300 tests per cm(3)). Statistically significant differences in the abundance of calcareous and agglutinated tests between wet and dry seasons within the mangrove suggest that tests are systematically lost from this part of the system on an annual basis.A model of assemblage formation under shoreface progradation is presented which makes a direct link between surface assemblages, post-depositional processes and the composition and environmental resolution of the fossil assemblages entering the stratigraphic record. Assemblages within the mangrove undergo rapid taphonomic loss and are then overprinted during burial by the deep infaunal communities associated with the prograding higher-elevation environments. As such, much of the eventual mangrove sequence is represented entirely by assemblages produced relatively recently within an upper mangrove environment, and therefore cannot be differentiated according to elevation at the time of deposition. In addition, organic enrichment of upper mudflat deposits by mangrove roots, which occurs during progradation, results in the dissolution of calcareous tests from an similar to 40 cm thick stratigraphic interval. It is argued that in order to reliably recognise the changes to foraminiferal assemblages which occur during burial, assemblages must be compared with respect to stratigraphy, rather than reflexively downcore.

TI  - Rates of anaerobic microbial metabolism in wetlands of divergent hydrology on a glacial landscape
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeochemical transformations in wetlands impact water quality, nutrient transport across landscapes, and greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. This study examined anaerobic microbial respiration and methanogenesis in surficial sediments of six wetlands lying on glacial terrain in southwest Michigan, USA. Three of the wetlands were mainly groundwater-fed and three were mainly precipitation-fed. Ambient rates of denitrification, sulfate reduction, iron reduction, methanogenesis, and acetate turnover were measured at each wetland. Ambient denitrification rates were not detectable in any wetland, but denitrifying enzyme activity, measured in two wetlands, indicated that the potential to remove nitrate was higher in a groundwater-fed wetland. Iron reduction was measurable mainly in precipitation-fed wetlands while sulfate reduction was only measurable in the groundwater-fed wetlands. Methanogenesis was measurable in all wetlands, with no differences between wetlands with contrasting water sources, indicating that methanogenesis is important regardless of water source. Acetate turnover rates, which reflect total anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis, were higher in the groundwater-fed wetlands and proportional to the sum of the individual carbon mineralization rates across all wetlands. Even though there was substantial variation in the process rates among these wetlands, the general patterns indicate that water source influences the biogeochemical function of wetlands.

TI  - Production, respiration and ammonia excretion of two polychaete species in a north Norfolk saltmarsh
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The secondary production of Nereis diversicolor and Scoloplos armiger (Annelida, Polychaeta) was studied at Stiffkey saltmarshes (north Norfolk coast). Production estimation on the basis of monthly sampling (August 1992-July 1993) gives 17.91 g C m(-2) y(-1) for N: diversicolor, 3.37 g C m(-2) y(-1) for S. armiger. Oxygen consumption of individuals was studied using a respirometer at four temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C). At 15 degrees C, the relationships between O-2 consumption (mg h(-1)) and body dry weight (mg) is Y=0.003X(0.695) for S. armiger and Y=0.003X(0.498) for N. diversicolor. Ammonia excretion of S. armiger tends to increase with decreasing temperature whereas it increases from 5 to 15 degrees C for N. diversicolor. Carbon loss through respiration for the sampling period is estimated at 32 g C m(-2) y(-1) for S. armiger, and 31.7 g C m(-2) y(-1) for N: diversicolor. About 20 % of the potential supply of phytobenthic carbon in the marsh would be converted by the populations of both species. Estimations of carbon and nitrogen budgets of S. armiger are discussed.

TI  - Environmental factors driving seed bank diversity in alkali grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For an effective conservation and management in grasslands it is essential to understand mechanisms sustaining biodiversity. To gain knowledge is especially crucial in stressed grasslands harbouring a unique flora and fauna, like alkali grasslands. Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and environmental factors were studied in three stands of the following alkali grassland types: (i)Artemisia dry alkali grasslands at highest elevations; (ii) Puccinellia high and (iii) Puccinellia low grasslands at medium to low elevations, and (iv) Juncus wet alkali grasslands at the lowest elevations. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) Seed bank species diversity and density are the highest in the most stressed grassland types, where regeneration by seeds could have a major importance in sustaining vegetation diversity. (ii) Seed bank density of hygrophytes increases with decreasing elevation, because the cover of hygrophytes in the vegetation increases with decreasing elevation. The mean seed bank density ranged from 30,104 up to 51,410 seeds/m(2), which is higher than in most dry grasslands. Both the lowest seed bank density and diversity were detected in the most stressed Puccinellia high grasslands; Spergularia salina was the only abundant seed bank species (possessing at least 1000 seeds/m(2)). These results not supported our first hypothesis. We detected the highest seed densities of almost all hygrophyte species in the lowest-elevated Juncus grasslands. But, we did not find a significant monotonous correlation between elevation and the overall hygrophyte seed bank density; because most of the hygrophyte species were missing from the seed bank at the medium-elevated, but most saline Puccinellia grasslands. Thus, our results only partly supported the second hypothesis. In total we detected more species in the seed bank than in the aboveground vegetation which emphasises that seed bank plays an important role in sustaining the diversity of alkali grasslands. However, characteristic graminoids possessed no considerable seed bank, except for Juncus compressus (up to 38,619 seeds/m(2)). We can conclude that persistence and establishment of most alkali grassland species are not supported by the local persistent seed bank. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of the burrowing mud shrimp, Upogebia yokoyai, on carbon flow and microbial activity on a tidal flat
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mud shrimps, Upogebia spp., are major constituents of macrobenthic communities in tidal flats in Japan. The impact of Upogebia yokoyai on carbon flow on tidal flats was examined by comparing CO2 emission rates from plots with and without burrows in the Kurose River estuary, Japan. In situ CO2 emission rates from plots with burrows were significantly higher than from those without. Laboratory measurements using sediment core samples that excluded respiration of macrobenthic organisms showed similar trends. Although there were no significant differences in grain size distribution, water content, or ignition loss between the sediment cores with and without burrows, oxidation-reduction potential was significantly higher in sediment cores with burrows. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) indicated that microbial biomass and community structure did not differ significantly between cores with and without burrows. However, microbial respiration activity, as indicated by CO2 emission rates per total PLFA content, was significantly higher in sediment cores with burrows than in those without. Our results indicate that burrows of U. yokoyai change the physicochemical conditions and increase microbial activity in the sediment, significantly affecting carbon flow in the tidal flat.
